We document that firms with high robot exposure alter their technological focus over time and shift innovative activities towards AI which automation naturally complements through data accumulation. The shift is more pronounced for firms with greater data generation or prior AI-related research experience. Because AI patents are more costly (e.g., in labor input), albeit more general and original, firms with high automation experience a significant rise in R&amp;D expenditure but an initial drop in patent quantity, before benefiting\u2014an innovation \u201cJ-Curve.\u201d Our findings not only resolve the puzzle that globally firms invent less despite the greater research effort amidst rising automation, but also provides insights on the heterogeneous paths of innovation, all of which we rationalize in a parsimonious dynamic equilibrium model."

Using household survey and bank customer data during Hungary's 2008 currency crisis, we find that foreign currency borrowers cut consumption one-for-one with increased debt service, consistent with a foreign currency Fisher channel. Both the quantity and quality of expenditures decline, indicating a \"flight from quality.\" Debt revaluation has a limited effect on overall labor supply, but there is substitution toward foreign income and home production. Our findings point to the relevance of open-economy models with incomplete markets, heterogeneous foreign currency exposures, and liquidity constraints."

Using a database of abortion provider locations and operations in Texas from 2009\u20132019, we exploit variation in travel distance to the nearest facility created by clinic closures following the enforcement of Texas HB-2 in 2013. We confirm previous evidence that increased distance to the nearest abortion facility reduces abortions and increases births. We provide novel evidence that reduced access to abortion also leads to significant economic hardship, reflected in lower labor force participation, rising debt, widening income inequality, and heightened housing insecurity. This financial strain translates into higher rates of financially motivated crime, such as theft and burglary, with no significant effect on violent crime. These effects extend beyond directly affected individuals, reflecting intrahousehold spillovers. These findings suggest far-reaching consequences of restricted access to reproductive healthcare."

A credible answer to this question is foundational for understanding the nature and scope of racial inequality and discrimination in the United States. This article reviews and synthesizes a literature that studies this question by estimating the extent to which controlling for measures of human capital changes Black-white gaps in labor market outcomes, and discusses various conceptual and methodological issues related to interpreting this type of exercise. I show that while accurately interpreting this exercise and its many variants requires careful thinking, the results elucidate many important and subtle aspects of racial inequality in the United States."

Matching population data for Norway across two generations, we establish several results. First, parents make a transfer\u2014i.e., run down liquid assets\u2014when adult children experience negative labor income shocks. Consistent with dynastic insurance, we observe no transfers when income shocks are positive. Second, parents' responses depend on the nature of the shock. If losses are temporary, parents dissave; if they are persistent, parents save in order to make future transfers. Parental transfers offset 43% of temporary and 27% of persistent losses. Third, insurance is lower when children have other smoothing options, like spousal labor supply, and is greater for shocks to their own child versus a child\u2019s spouse. Support also increases if the spouse\u2019s parents can contribute, suggesting \u201ccompetition for attention.\u201d Lastly, insurance flows are one-way: children do not insure their parents against income losses."

Its projects involve complex challenges that require precision, agility, and foresight.</p><p>As Delci sees it, she\u2019s not just building infrastructure; she\u2019s building a smarter, safer future.</p><p>She was elevated this year to <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/senior\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE senior member</a>, a professional milestone that acknowledges the impact she has had on her field.</p><p>\u201cBecoming a senior member,\u201d she says, \u201creaffirmed that the path I chose\u2014to blend technology with infrastructure\u2014can truly drive meaningful change.\u201d</p><h2>A childhood dream takes shape</h2><p>Delci was born in<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itabirito\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Itabirito</a>, a small Brazilian town nestled in the mountains. Her father, a furniture store owner, and her mother, an artisan, instilled in her a love for learning and allowed her the freedom to dream big.</p><p>In 2012 she enrolled at <a href=\"https://www.unibh.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centro Universit\u00e1rio de Belo Horizonte</a> (UniBH) to study civil engineering. Delci chose what she calls a \u201csandwich bachelor\u2019s program\u201d\u2014an arrangement in which students begin their studies at their chosen local university, complete part of their coursework at a university abroad, and then return to their home institution to finish the degree.</p><p>In 2014 she was awarded a full scholarship by Brazil\u2019s federal <a href=\"https://estudonoexterior.com/science-without-borders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Without Borders</a> grant program. It covered tuition, housing, health insurance, learning materials, and airfare.</p><p>\u201cI believed that international academic experience would broaden my perspective and greatly enhance my education,\u201d Delci says. <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">But, she adds, she had to learn a new language to continue her studies.</a> First she took intensive English courses at <a href=\"https://ejf.hu/en/welcome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">E\u00f6tv\u00f6s J\u00f3zsef College</a>, in Baja, Hungary. She then completed two semesters of civil engineering courses, taught in English, at the <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>. From May to July 2015, she interned at <a href=\"https://www.vizmuvek.hu/en/home/aboutourcompany/company-information\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest Waterworks</a>, a city utility. She worked in the three main departments of the company: engineering, project management, and water treatment.</p><p>Delci returned to UniBH in the second semester of 2015 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2017. That same year, she earned a technical diploma in civil construction process operations from the <a href=\"https://www.fiemg.com.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federa\u00e7\u00e3o das Ind\u00fastrias do Estado de Minas Gerais</a>, a regional industry association based in Belo Horizonte.

In 2012, during her first stint at UniBH, she was an intern at <a href=\"https://www.delphiautoparts.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delphi</a> Automotive Systems do Brasil, in Itabirito, Minas Gerais. The role gave her hands-on experience in infrastructure maintenance of the industrial plant, including preparing purchase requisitions and work orders, as well as monitoring modifications in the plant layout, she says.</p><p>She joined Salum Constru\u00e7\u00f5es in 2020 as a trainee engineer<strong>. </strong>She worked on the remediation of waste rock piles at the <a href=\"https://vale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vale</a> <a href=\"https://www.gem.wiki/Vale_Vargem_Grande_Complex_Mine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vargem Grande complex</a> in Minas Gerais, part of Brazil\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://ief.mg.gov.br/w/floor-of-riches-the-iron-quadrangle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Quadrangle</a>.\u201d The site is one of many owned by Vale, the world\u2019s leading producer of iron ore.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to keep working on sustainable solutions, mentoring young engineers, and influencing policy to make the industry more environmentally responsible.\u201d</p><p>The initiative was part of Vale\u2019s broader efforts to minimize reliance on tailings dams\u2014earthen structures built to contain waste byproducts of ore processing\u2014 particularly after Brazil\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/09/world/americas/brazil-dam-collapse.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Brumadinho dam disaster</a> in 2019.

Among the methods she and her team tried was dry stacking, whereby fine, pulverized rock is filtered from tailings and deposited in piles rather than left in the form of sludge.</p><p>\u201cFurther studies and environmental licensing are still needed for large-scale implementation\u201d of dry stacking, she says.</p><p>Today, she\u2019s a civil engineer at Salum. As part of its corporate engineering team, she oversees several large-scale projects.</p><p>She uses cutting-edge technology including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://catenda.com/glossary/4d-bim-building-information-modeling-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4D building information modeling</a>. BIM, a digital construction planning method, uses <a href=\"https://www.gp-radar.com/3d-laser-scanning/bim-modeling\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3D modeling</a> to link each building component\u2014including earthworks, drainage systems and pavement layers\u2014with the construction schedule, with time being the fourth dimension. Such modeling makes the entire project more predictable by allowing teams to anticipate and mitigate risks before they impact the schedule. Her work also focuses on construction principles borrowed from<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/its-not-easy-being-lean\" target=\"_self\"> lean manufacturing</a> that emphasize reducing waste.</p><p>Her approach and knowledge have drawn the attention of her Salum peers and the construction industry at large, she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about digital engineering and how it can help reduce costs, save time, and improve safety,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about getting the work done. It\u2019s about doing it smarter and more sustainably.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s also helping to reshape a traditionally male-dominated field.</p><p>\u201cHeavy civil construction didn\u2019t intimidate me; it motivated me,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to show that engineering talent has no gender. There\u2019s space for women to lead here, and we\u2019re claiming it.\u201d</p><p>Her <a href=\"https://sevenpublicacoes.com.br/RCS/article/view/6635\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> has been published in <a href=\"https://sevenpublicacoes.com.br/RCS/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Revista Cientifica</em></em> <em><em>Sistem\u00e1tica</em></em></a>, the<a href=\"https://ojs.brazilianjournals.com.br/ojs/index.php/BRJD/index\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Brazilian Journal of Development</em></em></a>, and other journals. She has received recognition for leading initiatives that use digital technology to improve large-scale construction. A key indicator of this recognition is the widespread citation of her research by experts. For instance, her articles \u2018Digital Monitoring of Heavy Equipment...\u2019 and \u2018The Effectiveness of Last Planner System...\u2019 have been cited 66 and 56 times, respectively, according to Google Scholar. In academia, this level of citation is an exceptionally high honor, demonstrating that her work is a foundational and influential contribution to the advancement of knowledge in her field.</p><h2>The IEEE advantage</h2><p>Delci heard about IEEE through colleagues who praised its global network of members and technical resources. She joined, she says, to expand her knowledge, collaborate with innovators, and stay ahead of technological trends.</p><p>Today she serves as a volunteer reviewer for several IEEE technical committees and senior member applications, giving back to the organization that helped elevate her career.</p><p>\u201cIEEE showed me that engineering isn\u2019t just local\u2014it\u2019s global,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a community of people who believe in building something better, together.\u201d</p><h2>A focus on sustainable solutions </h2><p>Asked about her long-term goals, Moreira doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI want to keep working on sustainable solutions, mentoring young engineers, and influencing policy,\u201d she says, \u201cto make the industry more environmentally responsible.\u201d</p><p>Her advice to students considering engineering? \u201cIf you\u2019re curious and want to solve real problems, engineering is for you,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t let stereotypes define your path.

Or at least, that\u2019s what humanoid robotics companies have been consistently promising, enabling them to raise <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrakeay_agility-robotics-a-humanoid-robot-maker-activity-7312580510977769472-mifD/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds</a> of <a href=\"https://apptronik.com/news-collection/apptronik-raises-350-million-in-series-a-funding\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">millions</a> of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figure-ai-shakes-silicon-valley-140122922.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dollars</a> at valuations that run into the billions.</p><p>Delivering on these promises will require a lot of robots. Agility Robotics expects to ship \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-03-04/2025-the-year-for-humanoid-robots-agility-robotics-ceo-video\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds</a>\u201d of its Digit robots in 2025 and has a factory in Oregon capable of building <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/agility-humanoid-robotics-factory\" target=\"_self\">over 10,000</a> robots per year. Tesla <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/musk-tells-tesla-workers-dont-sell-your-shares-98691278\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">is planning </a>to produce 5,000 of its Optimus robots in 2025, and at least 50,000 in 2026. Figure believes \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2025/01/30/figure-plans-to-ship-100000-humanoid-robots-over-next-4-years/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">there is a path to 100,000 robots</a>\u201d by 2029. And these are just three of the largest companies in an increasingly crowded space.</p><p>Amplifying this message are many financial analysts: <a href=\"https://institute.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/transformation/humanoid-robots.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America Global Research</a>, for example, predicts that global humanoid robot shipments will reach 18,000 units in 2025. And <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/humanoid-robot-market-5-trillion-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley Research estimates</a> that by 2050 there could be over 1 billion humanoid robots, part of a US $5 trillion market.</p><p>But as of now, the market for humanoid robots is almost entirely hypothetical. Even the most successful companies in this space have deployed only a small handful of robots in carefully controlled pilot projects. And future projections seem to be based on an extraordinarily broad interpretation of jobs that a capable, efficient, and safe humanoid robot\u2014which does not currently exist\u2014might conceivably be able to do. Can the current reality connect with the promised scale?</p><h2>What Will It Take to Scale Humanoid Robots?</h2><p>Physically building tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of humanoid robots is certainly possible in the near term. In 2023, <a href=\"https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/record-of-4-million-robots-working-in-factories-worldwide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on the order of 500,000 industrial robots were installed worldwide</a>. Under the basic assumption that a humanoid robot is approximately equivalent to four industrial arms in terms of components, existing supply chains should be able to support even the most optimistic near-term projections for humanoid manufacturing.</p><p>But simply building the robots is arguably the easiest part of scaling humanoids, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meloneewise/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Melonee Wise</a>, who served as chief product officer at Agility Robotics until this month. \u201cThe bigger problem is demand\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone has found an application for humanoids that would require several thousand robots per facility.\u201d Large deployments, Wise explains, are the most realistic way for a robotics company to scale its business, since onboarding any new client can take weeks or months. An alternative approach to deploying several thousand robots to do a single job is to deploy several hundred robots that can each do 10 jobs, which seems to be what most of the humanoid industry is betting on in the medium to long term.</p><p>While there\u2019s a belief across much of the humanoid robotics industry that rapid progress in AI must somehow translate into rapid progress toward multipurpose robots, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/solve-robotics\" target=\"_self\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfvctjoMPk8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clear</a> how, when, or if that will happen. \u201cI think what a lot of people are hoping for is they\u2019re going to AI their way out of this,\u201d says Wise. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is that currently AI is not robust enough to meet the requirements of the market.\u201d</p><h2>Bringing Humanoid Robots to Market</h2><p><span>Market requirements for humanoid robots include a slew of extremely dull, extremely critical things like battery life, reliability, and safety. Of these, battery life is the most straightforward\u2014for a robot to usefully do a job, it can\u2019t spend most of its time charging. The next version of Agility\u2019s Digit robot, which can handle payloads of up to 16 kilograms, includes a bulky \u201cbackpack\u201d containing a battery with a charging ratio of 10 to 1: The robot can run for 90 minutes, and fully recharge in 9 minutes. Slimmer humanoid robots from other companies must necessarily be making compromises to maintain their svelte form factors.</span></p><p>In operation, Digit will probably spend a few minutes charging after running for 30 minutes. That\u2019s because 60 minutes of Digit\u2019s runtime is essentially a reserve in case something happens in its workspace that requires it to temporarily pause, a not-infrequent occurrence in the logistics and manufacturing environments that Agility is targeting. Without a 60-minute reserve, the robot would be much more likely to run out of power mid-task and need to be manually recharged. Consider what that might look like with even a modest deployment of several hundred robots weighing over a hundred kilograms each. \u201cNo one wants to deal with that,\u201d comments Wise.</p><p>Potential customers for humanoid robots are very concerned with downtime. Over the course of a month, a factory operating at 99 percent reliability will see approximately 5 hours of downtime. Wise says that any downtime that stops something like a production line can cost tens of thousands of dollars per minute, which is why many industrial customers expect a couple more 9s of reliability: 99.99 percent. Wise says that Agility has demonstrated this level of reliability in some specific applications, but not in the context of multipurpose or general-purpose functionality.</p><h2>Humanoid Robot Safety</h2><p><span>A humanoid robot in an industrial environment must meet general </span><a href=\"https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/ansi-b11-standards-safety-of-machinery/\" target=\"_blank\">safety</a><span> </span><a href=\"https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2006-42-ec-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a><span> for industrial machines. In the past, robotic systems like autonomous vehicles and drones have benefited from immature regulatory environments to scale quickly. But Wise says that approach can\u2019t work for humanoids, because the industry is already heavily regulated\u2014the robot is simply considered another piece of machinery.</span></p><p>There are also more specific<a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ria/ansiriar15082020\" target=\"_blank\"> safety standards</a> currently under development for humanoid robots, explains Matt Powers, associate director of autonomy R&amp;D at Boston Dynamics. He notes that his company is helping develop an <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/91469.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) safety standard for dynamically balancing legged robots</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that the top players in the field, like Agility and Figure, are joining us in developing a way to explain why we believe that the systems that we\u2019re deploying are safe,\u201d Powers says.</p><p>These standards are necessary because the traditional safety approach of cutting power may not be a good option for a dynamically balancing system. Doing so will cause a humanoid robot to fall over, potentially making the situation even worse. There is no simple solution to this problem, and the initial approach that Boston Dynamics expects to take with its Atlas robot is to keep the robot out of situations where simply powering it off might not be the best option. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with relatively low-risk deployments, and then expand as we build confidence in our safety systems,\u201d Powers says. \u201cI think a methodical approach is really going to be the winner here.\u201d</p><p>In practice, low risk means keeping humanoid robots away from people. But humanoids that are restricted by what jobs they can safely do and where they can safely move are going to have more trouble finding tasks that provide value.</p><h2>Are Humanoids the Answer?</h2><p><span>The issues of demand, battery life, reliability, and safety all need to be solved before humanoid robots can scale. But a more fundamental question to ask is whether a bipedal robot is actually worth the trouble.</span></p><p>Dynamic balancing with legs would theoretically enable these robots to navigate complex environments like a human. Yet demo videos show these humanoid robots as either mostly stationary or repetitively moving short distances over flat floors. The promise is that what we\u2019re seeing now is just the first step toward humanlike mobility. But in the short to medium term, there are much more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective platforms that can take over in these situations: robots with arms, but with wheels instead of legs.</p><p>Safe and reliable humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize the labor market at some point in the future. But potential is just that, and despite the humanoid enthusiasm, we have to be realistic about what it will take to turn potential into reality. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cWhy Humanoid Robots Aren\u2019t Scaling.\u201d</em></p>"

A small core team will continue on to shut Natcast down over the next few weeks, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The organization was founded in 2023 to run NSTC, which the law established to conduct \u201cresearch and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology and grow the domestic semiconductor workforce to strengthen the economic competitiveness and security of the domestic supply chain.\u201d</p><p>However, on 25 August Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the department <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/natcast\" target=\"_blank\">would not deliver the US $7.4 billion</a> in funds under its contract with the government. In an accusatory <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Natcast-CEO-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to Natcast CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/deirdre-hanford/\" target=\"_blank\">Deirdre Hanford </a>and a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/department-commerce-takes-action-against-biden-administrations\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, Lutnick claimed the nonprofit was not created legally, and said that the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/chips\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> would be taking over NSTC operations.</p><p><span>The Commerce Department has been suppressing Natcast\u2019s operations for many months, </span><em>IEEE Spectrum</em><span> has learned. According to multiple sources, the organization\u2019s research agenda was completed in April and should have been accepted and processed by Commerce in a matter of weeks. But it never happened. A memo selecting awardees for research into </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/prism\" target=\"_blank\">reducing the impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from semiconductor manufacturing</a><span> was submitted to Commerce but never approved. Three groups won parts of a </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-finalizes-aidrfic-research-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">$30 million grant to transform the design of RF chips using machine learning</a><span>, but at least one awardee has gotten no word on when or whether the funding will flow.</span></p><p>\u201cThis is a sad end,\u201d said one person who requested anonymity and was involved in early debate about the NSTC. </p><p>Lutnick\u2019s characterization of Natcast\u2019s creation as cronyism \u201cis pretty frustrating,\u201d this person continued. The idea that NSTC would be operated by an independent public-private partnership, which is written into the law, came from deep consultation with industry and was intended to insulate its work from politics. The organization needed such protection to make good technical decisions, because in selecting who gets funds \u201cthere are always more losers than winners,\u201d this person said.</p><p>Over the past week, Natcast has been defending itself and its staff against Lutnick\u2019s accusations. On 4 September, in a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-member-letter-regarding-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">letter to its 200 members</a>, Hanford countered Lutnick\u2019s assertions that the organization was packed with Biden administration cronies and that it was run as a \u201cslush fund.\u201d Hanford pointed to the multiple layers of government and industry oversight Natcast operates under and the experienced semiconductor industry staff it has brought on. She added that the nonprofit had stuck to its agreements with the government, submitting 119 \u201cmilestones and deliverables\u201d to Commerce.</p><h2>What\u2019s Lost Without Natcast</h2><p>On 8 September, Natcast published a detailed <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-assets-supporting-the-continued-mission-of-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">overview of what it has done so far</a>. Accomplishments included creating an industry-driven R&amp;D agenda, the development of multiple workforce programs, and the signing on of some 200 members. These members included cutting-edge logic and memory companies (such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skhynix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SK Hynix</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona\" target=\"_self\">TSMC</a>), small companies like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/atomera-plans-to-breathe-new-life-into-older-chip-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">Atomera</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=encharge+ai\" target=\"_self\">EnCharge AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">Polar Semiconductor</a>, and multiple universities and makers of semiconductor tools and equipment.</p><p><a href=\"https://natcast.org/nstcmembership/members\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a> had the right to use facilities and other infrastructure that Natcast was standing up (for a fee) and participate in research. One goal for the infrastructure was to reduce the time from concept to prototype by 30 percent. Access to the tools and processes NSTC would provide is out of reach for even some of the country\u2019s top researchers, <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s source said. Without that access, startups and researchers won\u2019t be able to afford to do relevant work using 300-millimeter wafers and advanced chip-technology nodes. Despite the fact that not all of its facilities were complete, Natcast had plans to proceed with research by chaining together existing infrastructure around the country.</p><p>In addition, the document from 8 September detailed the expert in-house team at Natcast, and said that expertise allowed it to evaluate R&amp;D awards at twice the rate of federal agencies while requiring considerably less overhead than government, universities, and non-profit research organizations like Imec. (It forecast a 10 percent overhead on expenses over 10 years.)</p><p>\u201cNatcast was supposed to do what industry couldn\u2019t solve by itself,\u201d said a source familiar with the situation. Its R&amp;D program was aimed at solving big problems, such as collapsing the time and energy required to <a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/smap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">move data between memory and computing</a>, in a way that the whole industry could benefit from.<span></span></p>"

These days, however, blockchain is most famous as the tool enabling <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money?utm_campaign=post-teaser&amp;utm_content=ibfuflhf\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies</a>. Most recently</span><span>, the Trump administration has </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/business/bitcoin-crypto-rally-us-stocks\" target=\"_blank\">taken</a><span> on a pro-cryptocurrency stance, boosting blockchain\u2019s </span>popularity and media prominence.</p><p><span>Cryptography is central to the functioning of blockchains, whether for a decentralized Web or for cryptocurrencies. Every time a cryptocurrency transaction is initiated, all parties involved in the transaction need to securely prove that they agree to the transfer. This is done via a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\" target=\"_blank\">digital signature</a>: a cryptographic protocol that generates a secret, private key that is unique to each user and a public key that the user shares. Then, the private key is used to generate a unique signature for each transaction. The public key can be used to verify that, indeed, the signature was created by the holder of the private key. In this way, Web3 in every incarnation relies heavily on cryptography. </span></p><p><span>To learn more about the evolution of Web3, and cryptography\u2019s role, we caught up with</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://wahby.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Riad Wahby</a><span>, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, and a cofounder and CEO of hardware-backed Web3 security platform </span><a href=\"https://cubist.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Cubist</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> Wahby explained what Web3 was meant to be, what it\u2019s become, and how hardware-backed cryptography will enable its future.<br /></span></p><h3>Web3 Began as a Response to What Came Before</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: What is Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Riad Wahby:</strong> That\u2019s the hardest question that you\u2019re going to ask by far, because I don\u2019t know how to answer it in a way that satisfies everyone.</p><p>The term Web3 was coined around 2014, by people who looked at the way that the Web had developed. Web 1.0 was the first Web bubble, the dot-com bubble. Web 2.0, roughly speaking, is Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Apple and Netflix, and the like. And the perception, especially from folks who originally coined this term Web3, was that these companies had basically taken the Web in the wrong direction, because your privacy is gone, and you\u2019re the product, so to speak. You use Gmail for free because Google is mining your emails to sell things like better advertising. Web3 was originally a reaction to this. Early proponents of Web3 basically said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We want to take back control of our stuff. I want to own my own data, and maybe cryptocurrencies and blockchains are the way there.\u201d So that\u2019s where the term originally came from.</p><p><strong>What does the term mean now?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Now it doesn\u2019t mean anything like that at all. Now Web3 is the broader ecosystem around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. And I think basically all of that revolutionary spirit has gone away in favor of building financial products and making a lot of money doing it. As far as I can tell, the term has really transformed from a reaction to a lack of privacy and a lack of sovereignty in my own data to \u201cHey, this is a technology that has something to do with blockchains.\u201d Maybe you can buy some kind of speculative meme coin and make a bunch of money doing it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe that took a dark turn at the end. That\u2019s how things go.</p><p><strong>How are those two definitions connected?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Cryptography really fits into the revolutionary spirit, in the sense that the folks who want to cast off the chains of things like Google and Facebook, one of the tenets was\u2014\u201dThe way that we\u2019ll do that is we\u2019ll build this technology that\u2019s sort of amazing and that gives us all these great properties.\u201d And they were going to do that using some advanced cryptographic technologies. This is the reason that there\u2019s so many people who are cryptography researchers at universities that also are involved deeply in some kind of cryptocurrency. Because it\u2019s like this is a sea change in the way that cryptography gets used in the world.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it used to be that if you were working on really any kind of cryptography, regardless of how theoretical or how practical you intended it to be, you knew that there was not much of a chance that any of it was going to get really used in the world, unless it was extremely practical and extremely focused on solving some immediate problem. And it just used to be the case that people were extremely conservative about what kind of cryptography they used. Basically, everyone thought, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of this crazy stuff. That\u2019s all theory. Nobody cares. The only stuff we need is what lets you connect to Amazon and safely buy stuff.\u201d The rise of cryptocurrencies brought with it this whole shift in the way that cryptography gets deployed in the world, where now if you can come up with some interesting functionality that\u2019s enabled by some advanced cryptography, probably somewhere somebody is going to try and turn that into a product that they can sell.</p><h3>Web3 Is Both Good and Bad for Cryptography</h3><p><strong>What effect has this had on the cryptographic community?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> It\u2019s both good and bad. It\u2019s good in that this means that there\u2019s a lot of motivation to build interesting, cool stuff. And as a researcher in cryptography, I love it because it means that there\u2019s tons more research money being poured into cryptography.</p><p>That\u2019s the good side. The bad side is that the reason that people were so conservative about deploying new cryptography is that it\u2019s easy to get the security mechanism wrong. The default state of cryptography is [to assume everything is] broken. You have to be very, very careful that each change that you make isn\u2019t returning your cryptography to the default state. I\u2019m not saying that people in Web3 aren\u2019t careful. They are. It\u2019s just by the nature of things, since it\u2019s a much faster time frame, there\u2019s much more pressure to just push stuff into production. And I think the downside is that we have seen a little bit of brokenness. It\u2019s hopefully not causing people to lose oodles of money. And I think the historical record bears this out: People lose oodles of money because other people are really dishonest, not because the cryptography is broken for the most part. But the cryptography can also be broken, and that can also be worrisome. But I\u2019d say from the perspective of somebody who\u2019s doing research in cryptography, the impact of Web3 on the cryptographic community has generally been a good thing.</p><p><strong>Now you\u2019re focused on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip\" target=\"_blank\">hardware security</a>. Can you explain what that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Any cryptocurrency has this property that if I hold some token, and I want to send it to somebody else, the way that I do that is by producing a digital signature that says, I want to spend this token. The secret key is what lets you generate a signature. So if you have 10 <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-merge-heralds-cryptos-climate-friendly-future\" target=\"_blank\">E</a>TH [cryptocurrency coins], and they\u2019re all protected by this key, and somebody takes a copy of your key, then life is bad.</p><p>With a digital signature key it could just be sitting on your hard drive, and then you get some malware, and now somebody has silently stolen your key. There have been these big, broadly targeted malware campaigns where millions and millions of people have all had their keys stolen. So now the criminals are just like sitting there counting up all the money that they\u2019ve stolen, and there\u2019s no reversing transactions, unlike at a bank.</p><p>Here\u2019s where hardware comes in. This is not really a Web3 technology, this is kind of old, good stuff. There are these devices called hardware security modules, and they\u2019ve been used for multiple decades. This is a physical device, and this device can run certain cryptographic algorithms. And it knows enough that when you tell it, \u201cHey, please generate me a key,\u201d it can generate you a key securely. And when you tell it, \u201cPlease give me a signature,\u201d it can give you a signature securely. But the important thing is the way that it\u2019s designed, the key never leaves this piece of hardware. It turns what was a piece of data into a physical object. And we know how to secure a physical object.</p><p><strong>You\u2019re working on extending hardware security for more use cases. Can you explain what you\u2019re doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> There are two issues with the standard hardware security module.</p><p>No. 1, you need more cryptography support, so you need to be able to apply digital signatures to transactions very quickly if you\u2019re actively trading. And No. 2, you need a way of expressing that it\u2019s not just a key that can generate any signature. It\u2019s a key that also has attached to it some kind of policy that says these are the kinds of signatures that are okay to generate, and everything else is not allowed, to add extra security. These are the two directions that we have that our technology enables within traditional hardware security modules.</p><p>We start with the security that\u2019s provided by the traditional hardware security module, and we extend it using this, actually another piece of trusted hardware called the Trusted Execution Environment. We extend it to support the actual kinds of cryptography that are needed for Web3 and to support this rich programmable policy layer that lets you say, \u201cThis key is only intended for this specific kind of use,\u201d or \u201canytime somebody tries to make a payment from this key, first I have to check whether the recipient is subject to sanctions,\u201d or any other rule. So in the end, we have, not only a hardware security module, we have also this Trusted Execution Environment and this policy layer, and all this other cryptographic stuff that together gives us a hardware security module that\u2019s really designed for the Web3 use case.</p>"

Usually, they want to write an article for us. But one bold query I received in January 2024 went much further: An undergraduate engineering student named <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatosin-kolade/?originalSubdomain=ng\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oluwatosin Kolade</a>, from Obafemi Awolowo University, in Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300, Nigeria, volunteered to be our robotics editor. </p><p>Kolade\u2014Tosin to his friends\u2014had been the newsletter editor for his IEEE student branch, but he\u2019d never published an article professionally. His earnestness and enthusiasm were endearing. I explained that we already have a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/evan-ackerman\" target=\"_self\">robotics editor</a>, but I\u2019d be glad to work with him on writing, editing, and ultimately publishing an article. </p><p> Back in 2003, I had met plenty of engineering students when I traveled to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\">Nigeria to report </a>on the SAT-3/WASC cable, the first undersea fiber-optic cable to land in West Africa. I remember seeing students gathering around obsolete PCs at Internet caf\u00e9s connected to the world via a satellite dish powered by a generator. I challenged Tosin to tell <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> readers what it\u2019s like for engineering students today. The result is \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Lessons from a Janky Drone</a>.\u201d</p><p>I decided to complement Tosin\u2019s piece with the perspective of a more established engineer in sub-Saharan Africa.

As he learned when he traveled to Nigeria earlier this year, the country now has eight undersea cables delivering 380 terabits of capacity, yet less than half of the population has broadband access. </p><p>I got a sense of Nigeria\u2019s bandwidth issues during my weekly video calls with Tosin to discuss his article. The connection was pretty good, except when it wasn\u2019t. Still, I reminded myself, two decades ago such calls would have been nearly impossible. </p><p>Through those weekly chats, we established a professional connection, which made it that much more meaningful when I got to meet Tosin in person this past May at the <a href=\"https://2025.ieee-icra.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE ICRA robotics conference</a>, in Atlanta. Tosin was attending thanks to a scholarship from the <a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</a>. Like a kid in a candy shop, he kibbutzed with fellow scholarship winners, attended talks, checked out robots, and met the engineers who built them. </p><p>As Tosin embarks on the next leg in his career journey, he is supported by the IEEE community, which not only recognizes his promise but gives him access to a network of professionals who can help him and his cohort realize their potential.</p>"

I have been writing about dark skies and light pollution for almost 20 years. And I have seen some breathtaking skies\u2014southern Morocco at the edge of the desert so plush with stars it still seems like a dream, the Racetrack in Death Valley with stars rising in the east and dropping off the edge of the world in the west. At other times when I\u2019ve gone to see the sky, I found too much humidity in the air, or too many clouds, or the obscuring smoke from a burning world. In the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, the famous skies were veiled by a freak sandstorm from the Sahara.</p><p>But the main reason that city dwellers can no longer see a starry night is simply all the artificial light we waste into the sky. There\u2019s even a scale for this\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_scale\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Bortle scale</a>, named after an amateur astronomer in New York state who grew tired of younger astronomers inviting him out to supposedly dark viewing sites only to find those sites not so dark. John E. Bortle\u2019s scale goes from 1 to 9, from darkest (no artificial light on the ground or in the sky) to brightest (inner cities).</p><p>Most people will live the majority of their lives in level 5 or above, without the experience of a naturally dark sky. And ever-increasing numbers of people live in areas with levels of 7, 8, and 9. They may think of these bright levels as normal, what \u201cdarkness\u201d is supposed to be.</p><p>Over the past decade, the shift from electric light to electronic lighting\u2014in the form of light-emitting diodes\u2014has made the problem worse. LEDs are generally brighter than traditional electric lights, often emit more blue-white light, and are more energy efficient. But too often this efficiency means we use more of them, creating more artificial light at night. <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq7781\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A recent study estimated the growth of light pollution worldwide from 2011 to 2022 at 10 percent per year, a doubling roughly every eight years.</a></p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/jim-benya-the-illuminator\" target=\"_self\">Lighting Up Yosemite</a></p><p>Despite these conditions, Bortle Scale 1 areas still exist, just not where most of us live. When I asked a friend at the U.S. National Park Service\u2014whose <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1050/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division</a> measures levels of darkness throughout the National Park System\u2014where to find a dark sky, he hesitated to name anywhere in the lower 48 states. The Outback in Australia would be a good place, he said, or Chile.</p><p>And so I\u2019m here, traveling with <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pedro-Sanhueza\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pedro Sanhueza</a>, an environmentalist and longtime dark-skies advocate who has devoted the past two decades to protecting his country\u2019s dark skies. As we drive, Pedro tells me that in the 25 years he\u2019s lived in La Serena, the population has almost doubled, and the lights have grown, too. The sleepy city where the Milky Way used to spend the night in everyone\u2019s backyard is getting so big that astronomers in the Elqui Valley are beginning to worry, even as billions of dollars go into building new observatories like the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vera-rubin-observatory-first-images\" target=\"_self\">Vera C. Rubin Observatory at Cerro Pach\u00f3n</a>.</p><p><span></span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"This image of the Bortle Scale shows, from left to right, the increase in the number of stars visible in cities compared to excellent dark sky conditions along a continuum.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2bcd4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/this-image-of-the-bortle-scale-shows-from-left-to-right-the-increase-in-the-number-of-stars-visible-in-cities-compared-to-exce.png?id=61595554&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This image illustrates the 9-point Bortle scale, which quantifies the impact of light pollution on the darkness of a night sky at a particular location. Star visibility increases dramatically from left (urban areas with heavy light pollution) to right (excellent dark-sky conditions).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">P. Hor\u00e1lek and M. Wallner/ESO</small></p>Still, tonight seems promising. The sky is mostly clear, with no storms in the forecast. Northern Chile boasts more than 300 nights of clear skies a year, and I\u2019m grateful to see only two clouds overhead. As we leave the main highway and begin to wind through the mountains, I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll find the kind of darkness that so many places have lost.<p>For 20 minutes, we creep around curves and navigate road repairs, ours the only car. Bats flicker above the gravel, a statuelike owl perches on a bare roadside limb. The mountains disappear as we climb, as does the road behind us, and we see only the world our headlights carve from the dark. Part of me wishes we could turn the headlights off too and ride beneath a sky filling with stars. But the rest of me knows this is a terrible idea.</p><p><span>When we finally arrive at our destination, a small private observatory with two large telescopes, I am stunned by the brightness of the sky. In a line stretched back toward La Serena, three planets\u2014Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter\u2014glow like passenger jets in low approach for landing. Though I\u2019ve never seen it before, I recognize the Southern Cross immediately, its shape shining just above a mountain\u2019s ridge to the south. The constellation Orion catches my eye, its iconic three-star belt so familiar\u2014until I realize it\u2019s upside down from how I see it back home. Nearby glows the red eye of Taurus the Bull, the star of Aldebaran, only 65 light-years away. If you kept to highway speeds, it would take 800 million years to get there by car.</span></p><p><span>When you get to a place that is still naturally dark and see a night sky like the one our ancestors knew, what you feel is recognition\u2026reconnecting with something you maybe didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d become disconnected from.</span></p><p>Someone points out the Magellanic Clouds, galaxies visible only from the Southern Hemisphere. They\u2019re clouds of stars. \u201cYes, tens of thousands of millions,\u201d says Pedro. The Large Magellanic Cloud alone is estimated to have 30 billion stars. And distances? The Large Magellanic Cloud lies about 160,000 light-years from Earth, the Small Magellanic Cloud about 200,000 light-years away. We use light-years\u2014the distance that light can travel in a year\u2014to talk about distance in space. In this case, that\u2019s 160,000 or 200,000 multiplied by 9.5 trillion kilometers. And these are among the closest galaxies to our own Milky Way. At this, my brain begins to spin\u2014how are we to grasp such numbers? \u201cEven astronomers can\u2019t truly grasp these scales,\u201d the popular astronomer <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-big-is-space/\" target=\"_blank\">Phil Plait writes</a>. \u201cWe work with them, and we can do math and physics with them, but our ape brains still struggle to comprehend even the distance to the moon\u2014and the universe is two million trillion times bigger than that.\u201d</p><p>When I hear such numbers, I can\u2019t do much but nod. And that\u2019s okay. To stare into the sky unable to grasp what you see, the numbers and distances bending your brain beyond its reach, is part of what makes this experience so valuable\u2014a reminder that we are not in control of everything, our anxieties are small, our lives brief, and all the more reason to savor what we see, now and here. Rather than feeling overwhelmed, seeing these distant objects causes me to feel connected to something incomprehensibly larger than me. And from this a wonder at being alive, and the welcome thought that I get to exist in a universe where this exists, too.</p><p>As we stand watching, I tell Pedro I\u2019ve been thinking about the idea of \u201cscale,\u201d how we make sense of the distances and numbers in the night sky, and even the question of what good it does to look further and further into space.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A picture of city lights in the distance that show a reduced glow.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"029eb\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-picture-of-city-lights-in-the-distance-that-show-a-reduced-glow.png?id=61591118&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A picture of city lights in the distance that show a increased glow.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a7625\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-picture-of-city-lights-in-the-distance-that-show-a-increased-glow.png?id=61591123&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The lights of the town of Andacollo, Chile, were visibly reduced [top] during the Blackout for Our Skies event, as seen from Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.

Munizaga/CTIO/NSF/AURA/NOIRLab</small></p><p><span>Earlier that day, I\u2019d mentioned the idea of scale to </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paredesmanuel/?originalSubdomain=cl\" target=\"_blank\">Manuel Paredes</a><span>, my guide at the </span><a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/\" target=\"_blank\">Cerro Tololo observatory</a><span>. \u201cOn the hierarchy\u2014or scale\u2014of needs, you have to have food and water and shelter, but life isn\u2019t only those basic needs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a more philosophical or spiritual or soulful desire to look out there. And with looking to the night sky, trying to understand specific things like, What is a star? What\u2019s the sun? What is a supernova? Through these small questions, we are trying to answer these big questions, trying to get some satisfaction. I think that there\u2019s a need to understand our position in the universe very deep in our brains and in our hearts.\u201d</span></p><p>When you get to a place that is still naturally dark and see a night sky like the one our ancestors knew, what you feel is recognition. It\u2019s the feeling of reconnecting with something you maybe didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d become disconnected from. It\u2019s the way the voice of an old lover or friend rings through your body when you hear it again after some years. It\u2019s related to the way that images of the night sky\u2014as stunning as they may be\u2014aren\u2019t the same experience as seeing the sky for yourself.</p><p>This deep connection makes me recoil from the next thing I see: a long train of satellites rising from the horizon toward orbit. Before this, we had watched the slow scrawl of individual satellites, slight incisions on the black fabric overhead. I admit that I still feel some thrill at the sight, a thrill left over from my first sight of satellites near a northern lake decades ago. But when I was a child, there were only a few hundred of these artificial lights in the sky, and their uniqueness added to the wonder of the stars. Since then, the scale of their growth has been overwhelming. The number has already swelled to around<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/space/space-exploration/how-many-satellites-could-fit-in-earth-orbit-and-how-many-do-we-really-need\" target=\"_blank\"> 12,000</a>, and predictions are for<a href=\"https://www.marcus.com/us/en/resources/heard-at-gs/satellite-internet-is-about-to-lift-off\" target=\"_blank\"> 100,000 or more in a decade</a>. Astronomers and dark-sky advocates have been sounding the alarm, warning that our night skies, especially after dusk and before dawn, when most people look to the sky, will become crowded with as many \u201cmoving stars\u201d as static stars.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>We are cutting ourselves off from so much that might inspire us, from scales of time and distance and numbers that offer a chance to feel awe and wonder at this world where we live. </span></p><p>Pedro doesn\u2019t hold back about the satellites. \u201cI hate them so much,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is industry without control.\u201d</p><p>Much of his present work centers on helping Chile\u2019s mines comply with national laws limiting artificial light, a vital task in a country where mining produces more than half of the exports, including nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s copper and 30 percent of its lithium. At night, the mines shine like small cities, Pedro explains, but he\u2019s been able to make progress, a result he attributes to the large number of engineers the mines employ. \u201cThe mines have many well-prepared people,\u201d he says, \u201cand so if you explain in the proper way the technological solution, they will make the change.\u201d</p><p>He and the rest of the astronomical community currently face an immense challenge from a proposed new mine in the Atacama Desert, uncomfortably close to some of the most important observatories. Pedro calls the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/dark-skies-above-worlds-best-astronomy-sites-could-be-ruined-by-new-energy-project\" target=\"_blank\">INNA project</a>\u2014a proposed 7,400-acre (3,000-hectare) green-hydrogen production facility\u2014\u201cvery bad for Chile,\u201d with the light pollution, airborne dust, and atmospheric disturbance \u201cunderestimated systematically, the projections very limited and superficial.\u201d Nonetheless, he says, the mine may be approved by a national government hesitant to turn down the tax revenue the mine owners insist it will bring. This seems to be the perpetual dilemma when it comes to light pollution: the promise of economic gain for some at the expense of a dark-sky heritage that belongs to everyone.</p><p>I think about my 6-year-old daughter, and the future sky any child anywhere will know. The inexorable spread of artificial light, the explosion in the number of satellites\u2014on nearly any scale of time, these changes have happened in an instant. Beneath the Chilean night sky, the suddenness seems even more startling given the scale of astronomical time, where the faintest light we can see left its source about 13 billion years ago. The erasure of this experience robs us all, and especially future generations who will never see a night like this. That the costs of such loss are intangible makes them not a bit less important. We are cutting ourselves off from so much that might inspire us, from scales of time and distance and numbers that offer a chance to feel awe and wonder at this world where we live.</p><p>Even here, the lights from La Serena are rising on the western horizon to erase what low stars we might have seen. \u201cWe are losing 30 degrees above the horizon,\u201d Pedro says. \u201cWe are fighting almost every day a new offender.\u201d Here in Chile, a long strip of country where astronomers come to find the driest, clearest darkness in the world, the risk is that such darkness\u2014and all the celestial beauty it brings\u2014will slip away. There\u2019s no reason it has to, and for now there is still time.</p><p>But if we do nothing or not enough, we will lose nights like these here as we have lost them in so many other places. And the evening drive from La Serena will bring us only to somewhere darker than the city we left, rather than back in time to a world every human once knew. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

While we haven\u2019t yet gotten to the point where we\u2019ve lost access to space, there will come a day where that will happen if we don\u2019t do something about it. A new paper from <a href=\"https://www.eng.tohoku.ac.jp/english/research/embryo/takahashi.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kazunori Takahashi</a> of Tohoku University, in Japan, looks at a novel solution that uses a type of magnetic field typically seen in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/fusion-2662267312\" target=\"_blank\">fusion reactors</a> to decelerate debris using a plasma beam, while balancing itself with an equal and opposite thrust on the other side.</p><p>Researchers have been working on two main categories of systems for the type of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electrodynamic-tether-deborbit-satellite\" target=\"_blank\">deorbiting</a> work that might save us from Kessler Syndrome\u2014contact and noncontact. Contact systems physically make contact with the debris, such as by a net or a grappling hook, and slow the debris to a point where it can deorbit safely. This method faces the challenge that most debris is rotating uncontrollably, and could potentially destroy the satellite trying to make contact with it if it moves unexpectedly\u2014adding to the problem rather than solving it.</p><div class=\"badge_module shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\">\n<a class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"Universe Today logo; text reads &quot;This post originally appeared on Universe Today.&quot;\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/universe-today-logo-text-reads-this-post-originally-appeared-on-universe-today.png?id=60568425&amp;width=1800&amp;quality=85\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p><span>Therefore, noncontact forms are in the ascendancy, as they allow a system designed to deorbit another satellite to stay a few meters away while still affecting its speed. Typically they use systems like lasers, ion beams, or in the case of Takahashi\u2019s invention, plasma beams, to slow their intended target to a point where it can safely deorbit. </span>The problem with plasma-beam-based deorbiting systems is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion\" target=\"_blank\">Newton\u2019s third law</a>\u2014as the plasma is being directed toward the target, it is pushing the operational system away from the defunct one, essentially acting as a small plasma thruster. As the distance between the two increases, the slowing effect of the plasma decreases. To solve this problem, Takahashi and his fellow researchers presented a <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/articles/a-new-solution-to-the-space-junk-problem-spacecraft-with-plasma-beams-to-force-space-junk-to-burn-up\" target=\"_blank\">bidirectional thruster in a paper in 2018</a> that counteracted the pushing force of the plasma used to slow the target with an equal force in the opposite direction, allowing it to maintain its position.</p><h2>Advancements in Plasma Thruster Technology</h2><p>However, in that original paper, the thrust was too weak to effectively deorbit some of the larger potential targets for such a mission. So Takahashi set about improving the design by implementing a \u201ccusp-type\u201d magnetic field. These are typically used in fusion reactors to ensure the plasma doesn\u2019t interact with the wall of the magnetic chamber. The cusp of a magnetic field is a point at which two opposing magnetic fields meet and cancel out, creating a quick change in direction for the forces they apply. Ideally, this results in a stronger plasma beam.</p><p><span>That is what happened when Takahashi set up an experiment to test the new cusp system with the previous \u201cstraight-field\u201d system that had proved too weak. He saw a 20 percent improvement in the force that the plasma thruster exerted on the target, resulting in a 17.1-millinewton push at the same power level. When he bumped up the power level to 5 kilowatts (compared to the 3 kW in the original test), it showed an improved deceleration of about 25 mN, which is approaching the level of 30 mN expected to be needed to decelerate a 1-tonne piece of debris in 100 days. It also had the added benefit of using argon as fuel, which is cheaper compared with the xenon typically used in plasma thrusters.</span></p><p><span></span>Even with this success, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do before this becomes a fully fleshed-out system. The experiment was run in a vacuum chamber, with the plasma thruster only 30 centimeters away from the target, compared with the distance in meters that would be required in a real orbital environment. In fact, the debris target will also move relative to the deorbiting system as it slows down, so it will have to strike a balance of maintaining distance from a slowing object as well as continuing to fire the decelerating beam at it. And finally, there is the disadvantage of it using literally twice as much fuel as other solutions that don\u2019t require thrusters operating in opposite directions\u2014while fuel might not be much of a concern for plasma thrusters, operating one over 100 days is sure to consume a lot of it.</p><p>With all that being said, any new solution to this potentially catastrophic problem is welcome, and Takahashi will likely continue work on developing this prototype. Someday soon you might even be able to watch a dual-thrust plasma engine blasting away at a large piece of space junk.</p>"

Then, after an encouraging review, my manager asked if I\u2019d start managing a team of my own. I had received strong performance ratings and earned trust among my colleagues and the leadership team, and the organization\u2019s headcount was consistently increasing each year.</span></p><p>This is the standard origin story for engineers who transition to management. But the skills required to succeed as an engineer and the ones a manager has to have are significantly different. Strong engineers succeed through rigorous analytical ability and deep work. Strong managers (whose work is decidedly un-analytical!) motivate and grow people\u2019s <span>careers</span>, while also being prepared to jump into issues at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p><span>The ideal motivation to become a manager is simple: </span><strong>You care about people</strong><span>. Management is inherently a people-oriented </span><span>job</span><span>, which means managers should grow their reports through positive and constructive feedback. A good manager cares about discovering each person\u2019s zone of genius and then assigning work that best matches that engineer\u2019s profile. The byproduct of this is the ability to scale impact, but that should not be the primary motive.</span></p><p><span>A common, yet misguided, reason to switch to management is to earn more money. At least within Big Tech companies, managers and ICs at the same level are paid the same amount. In fact, some companies deliberately pay their managers less, simply to discourage mercenary engineers who are optimizing for compensation rather than people.</span></p><p><span></span><span>However, there is nuance here that\u2019s worth calling out. At more senior levels, managers are promoted at faster rates compared to ICs. A manager\u2019s impact is largely derived from their influence in an org, which includes the number of people in their reporting chain. A director with 50 engineers in their org can effectively \u201cclaim credit\u201d for the people on their team.</span></p><p><span></span><span>On the other hand, an individual contributor at the director level must produce output that has a similar scale of impact to what the 50 engineers shipped. As you can imagine, this is much harder. IC promotions at these levels require a level of technical brilliance that is difficult to reliably reproduce.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Managers often get promoted as they accumulate more people under them. This process can happen through re-orgs or employee departures, not necessarily through the unique contributions of the manager. The result is that managers who stick around long enough will naturally grow their </span><span>careers</span><span>. Empirically, this is obvious in the data. At a company like Meta or Google, there are far more VP-level managers than there are IC engineers of the equivalent level.</span></p><p><span></span><span>In the long term, therefore, managers do earn more money than individual contributors. This is not necessarily wrong, but you should reflect on your incentives and determine what will make you fulfilled beyond the money.</span></p><p><span>I ended up saying yes to the management opportunity I was offered, and I\u2019m very glad I did. Like any <span><span>job</span></span>, there were parts that I loved and parts that I didn\u2019t, and I ended up switching back to the IC ladder within a year.</span></p><p><span>\u2014Rahul</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-budget-cuts-trump-staff\" target=\"_blank\">NASA Cut 4,000 Staff, Where Will They Go?</a></h3><p><span></span><span>The U.S. space agency is undergoing a large \u201creduction in force,\u201d which includes about 4,000 employees who have taken offers to leave their positions through a \u201cdeferred resignation program.\u201d Where will ex-NASA engineers go next, and what does it mean for future missions?</span></p><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-budget-cuts-trump-staff\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What I Learned From a Janky Drone</a></h3><p><span>A Nigerian engineering student describes his experience as part of a pair of articles on engineering education in Africa, from the perspective of both a student and teacher. \u201cThey describe the challenges they face and what they see as the path forward for a continent brimming with aspiring engineers but woefully short on the resources necessary for a robust education,\u201d <em>IEEE Spectrum\u2019</em>s editor-in-chief Harry Goldstein writes in an accompanying note.</span><span></span></p><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-founders-prioritize-the-problem\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Founders Must Learn to Prioritize the Problem</a></h3><p>Taking innovative tech to market can be tricky for engineers coming from a research background.

A case in point, MLPerf, the bi-annual machine learning competition sometimes termed \u201cthe Olympics of AI,\u201d introduced three new benchmark tests, reflecting new directions in the field.</p><p>\u201cLately, it has been very difficult trying to follow what happens in the field,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-hodak/\" target=\"_blank\">Miro Hodak</a>, AMD engineer and MLPerf Inference working group co-chair. \u201cWe see that the models are becoming progressively larger, and in the last two rounds we have introduced the largest models we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>The chips that tackled these new benchmarks came from the usual suspects\u2014Nvidia, Arm, and Intel. Nvidia topped the charts, introducing its new <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/?ncid=no-ncid\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blackwell Ultra</a> GPU, packaged in a <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb300-nvl72/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GB300</a> rack-scale design. AMD put up a strong performance, introducing its latest <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi325x.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MI325X</a> GPUs. Intel proved that one can still do inference on CPUs with their <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/xeon.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xeon</a> submissions, but also entered the GPU game with an <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/workstations/b-series/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Arc Pro</a> submission.</p><h2>New Benchmarks</h2><p>Last round, MLPerf <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-inference\" target=\"_self\">introduced</a> its largest benchmark yet, a large language model based on Llama3.1-403B. This round, they topped themselves yet again, introducing a benchmark based on the Deepseek R1 671B model\u2014more than 1.5 times the number of parameters of the previous largest benchmark.</p><p>As a reasoning model, Deepseek R1 goes through several steps of chain-of-thought when approaching a query. This means much of the computation happens during inference then in normal LLM operation, making this benchmark even more challenging. Reasoning models are claimed to be the most accurate, making them the technique of choice for science, math, and complex programming queries.</p><p>In addition to the largest LLM benchmark yet, MLPerf also introduced the smallest, based on Llama3.1-8B. There is growing industry demand for low latency yet high-accuracy reasoning, explained Taran Iyengar, MLPerf Inference task force chair. Small LLMs can supply this, and are an excellent choice for tasks such as text summarization and edge applications.</p><p>This brings the total count of LLM-based benchmarks to a confusing four. They include the new, smallest Llama3.1-8B benchmark; a pre-existing Llama2-70B benchmark; last round\u2019s introduction of the Llama3.1-403B benchmark; and the largest, the new Deepseek R1 model. If nothing else, this signals LLMs are not going anywhere.</p><p>In addition to the myriad LLMs, this round of MLPerf inference included a new voice-to-text model, based on Whisper-large-v3. This benchmark is a response to the growing number of voice-enabled applications, be it smart devices or speech-based AI interfaces.</p><p>TheMLPerf Inference competition has two broad categories: \u201cclosed,\u201d which requires using the reference neural network model as-is without modifications, and \u201copen,\u201d where some modifications to the model are allowed. Within those, there are several subcategories related to how the tests are done and in what sort of infrastructure. We will focus on the \u201cclosed\u201d datacenter server results for the sake of sanity.</p><h2>Nvidia leads</h2><p>Surprising no one, the best performance per accelerator on each benchmark, at least in the \u2018server\u2019 category, was achieved by an Nvidia GPU-based system. Nvidia also unveiled the Blackwell Ultra, topping the charts in the two largest benchmarks: Lllama3.1-405B and DeepSeek R1 reasoning.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24996953/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p><a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-blackwell-ultra-for-the-era-of-ai-reasoning/#:~:text=vs.,-HGX%20H100&amp;text=Blackwell%20Ultra%20brings%20even%20more,processing%20millions%20of%20input%20tokens.\" target=\"_blank\">Blackwell Ultra</a> is a more powerful iteration of the Blackwell architecture, featuring significantly more memory capacity, double the acceleration for attention layers, 1.5x more AI compute, and faster memory and connectivity compared to the standard Blackwell. It is intended for the larger AI workloads, like the two benchmarks it was tested on.</p><p>In addition to the hardware improvements, director of accelerated computing products at Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davesalvator/\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Salvator</a> attributes the success of Blackwell Ultra to two key changes. First, the use of Nvidia\u2019s proprietary 4-bit floating point <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/number-representation\" target=\"_self\">number format</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvfp4-for-efficient-and-accurate-low-precision-inference/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NVFP4</a>. \u201cWe can deliver comparable accuracy to formats like BF16,\u201d Salvator says, while using a lot less computing power.</p><p>The second is so-called <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/latest/architecture/disagg_serving.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">disaggregated serving</a>. The idea behind disaggregated serving is that there are two main parts to the inference workload: prefill, where the query (\u201cPlease summarize this report.\u201d) and its entire context window (the report) are loaded into the LLM, and generation/decoding, where the output is actually calculated. These two stages have different requirements. While prefill is compute heavy, generation/decoding is much more dependent on memory bandwidth. Salvator says that by assigning different groups of GPUs to the two different stages, Nvidia achieves a performance gain of nearly 50 percent.</p><h2>AMD close behind</h2><p>AMD\u2019s newest accelerator chip, MI355X launched in July. The company offered results only in the \u201copen\u201d category where software modifications to the model are permitted. Like Blackwell Ultra, MI355x features 4-bit floating point support, as well as expanded high-bandwidth memory. The MI355X beat its predecessor, the MI325X, in the open Llama2.1-70B benchmark by a factor of 2.7, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahesh-balas/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mahesh Balasubramanian</a>, senior director of data center GPU product marketing at AMD.</p><p>AMD\u2019s \u201cclosed\u201d submissions included systems powered by AMD MI300X and MI325X GPUs. The more advanced MI325X computer performed similarly to those built with Nvidia H200s on the Lllama2-70b, the mixture of experts test, and image generation benchmarks.</p><p>This round also included the first hybrid submission, where both AMD MI300X and MI325X GPUs were used for the same inference task,the Llama2-70b benchmark. The use of hybrid GPUs is important, because new GPUs are coming at a <a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/03/19/nvidia-draws-gpu-system-roadmap-out-to-2028/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">yearly cadence</a>, and the older models, deployed en-masse, are not going anywhere. Being able to spread workloads between different kinds of GPUs is an essential step.</p><h2>Intel enters the GPU game</h2><p>In the past, Intel has remained steadfast that one does not need a GPU to do machine learning. Indeed, submissions using Intel\u2019s Xeon CPU still performed on par with the Nvidia L4 on the object detection benchmark but trailed on the recommender system benchmark.</p><p>This round, for the first time, an Intel GPU also made a showing. The <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/workstations/b-series/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Arc Pro</a> was first released in 2022. The MLPerf submission featured a graphics card called the <a href=\"https://www.maxsun.com/products/intel-arc-pro-b60-dual-48g-turbo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MaxSun Intel Arc Pro B60 Dual 48G Turbo</a> , which contains two GPUs and 48 gigabytes of memory. The system performed on-par with Nvidia\u2019s L40S on the small LLM benchmark and trailed it on the Llama2-70b benchmark.</p>"
