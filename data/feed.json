We use the class of constant elasticity trade models to provide quantitative evidence on these questions. We find that reductions in worldwide trade frictions over the period from 1960-2020 reduced the share of the United States in global GDP but raised its aggregate welfare. Similarly, productivity growth in Japan and China led to a decline in the relative income of the United States, but brought aggregate welfare gains from the resulting expansion in global production possibilities. Trade integration and foreign productivity growth have relatively modest effects on domestic income and welfare compared to domestic productivity growth."

        "summary": "This paper provides direct evidence that members of a disfavored group adjust their economic behavior in response to prejudice. We exploit plausibly exogenous, localized increases in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment generated by combat fatalities of U.S. service members from a given state during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. Linking detailed records on military fatalities with survey data, we estimate the causal effect of these shocks on the labor supply of Arab and Muslim men residing in the affected states. Following a home-state fatality, Arab and Muslim men reduce their weekly hours of work by approximately one percent relative to the baseline sample mean. The reduction is twice as large among the self-employed and concentrated in occupations requiring frequent customer or co-worker interaction. These patterns are consistent with avoidance-based sorting predicted by prejudice-based models of discrimination. The timing of the response coincides with short-lived increases in anti-Muslim hate crimes, confirming that the estimated effects reflect shifts in prejudice rather than broader economic conditions. Our findings provide direct evidence that prejudice can distort market outcomes by inducing targeted individuals to withdraw from interactions with prejudiced market participants."

Our experiment was embedded in a Bank of Italy survey covering around 3,000 firms. We elicited firms\u2019 beliefs about competitors\u2019 adoption of two advanced technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. We randomly provided half of the sample with accurate information about adoption rates. Most firms substantially underestimated competitors\u2019 current adoption, and when provided with information, they updated their expectations about competitors\u2019 future adoption. The information increased firms\u2019 own intended future adoption of robotics, although we do not observe a significant effect on AI adoption. Our findings provide causal evidence on coordination in innovation and illustrate how information frictions shape technology diffusion."

Leveraging new audit questions in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), and complementary tax return data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and detailed financial records from Sageworks, we find that (i) variation in reporting quality explains 10--20 percent of intra-industry total factor productivity dispersion, and (ii) evidence of complementarity between the effects of financial audits and management practices driving firm productivity. We then examine the underlying mechanisms. First, audits function as a managerial technology, improving the precision of internal information and raising efficiency, with stronger effects in competitive, low-margin industries and among younger firms. Second, exploiting cross-state variation in tax incentives, we show that audits constrain underreporting and mitigate the downward bias in measured productivity. Together, these results highlight the underrated importance of financial reporting quality driving firm productivity."

We find that while information does not increase efficiency, it reduces the likelihood that buyers incur losses when trading with low-quality sellers. Anticipating that additional signals will arrive, buyers hesitate to finalize deals immediately and exhibit a \u201cwaiting for news\u201d effect, making sizable offer adjustments only when sufficient positive signals have accumulated. In contrast, informed sellers are less sensitive to news but appear to wait for the offer that they deem acceptable."

        "summary": "How does a task-level minimum pay requirement for gig workers affect their earnings and employment? We study this question in the context of a January 2024 law in Seattle that establishes a per-task minimum pay standard for app-based delivery workers. Drawing on novel cross-platform, trip-level gig activity data, we compare earnings and employment trajectories around the implementation of the law for workers who were doing delivery work in Seattle before the reform against workers who had been active in other regions of Washington State. We find that the minimum pay law raised delivery pay per task, though the increases in base pay per task were partially offset by a substantial reduction in average tips, a major component of delivery pay. At the same time, the policy led to a reduction in the number of tasks completed by highly attached incumbent drivers (but not an increase in exit from delivery work), completely offsetting increased pay per task and leading to zero effect on monthly earnings. We find evidence that drivers experienced more unpaid idle time and longer distances driven between tasks, but find no evidence that drivers reduced their total time working on delivery apps and only limited evidence of switching from delivery to ride-hailing work. Using a simple model of the labor market for platform delivery drivers, we show that our evidence is consistent with free entry of drivers into the delivery market driving down the task-finding rate until expected earnings return to their pre-reform level. These findings highlight the challenges of raising pay in spot markets for tasks where there is free entry of workers."

I noted then, and it\u2019s still true two decades later: Software failures are universally unbiased. They happen in every country, to large companies and small. They happen in commercial, nonprofit, and governmental organizations, regardless of status or reputation.</p><p>Global IT spending has more than tripled in constant 2025 dollars since 2005, from US $1.7 trillion to $5.6 trillion, and continues to rise. Despite additional spending, software success rates have not markedly improved in the past two decades. The result is that the business and societal costs of failure continue to grow as software proliferates, permeating and interconnecting every aspect of our lives.</p><p>For those hoping AI software tools and coding copilots will quickly make large-scale IT software projects successful, forget about it. For the foreseeable future, there are hard limits on what AI can bring to the table in controlling and managing the myriad intersections and trade-offs among systems engineering, project, financial, and business management, and especially the organizational politics involved in any large-scale software project. Few IT projects are displays of rational decision-making from which AI can or should learn. As software practitioners know, IT projects suffer from enough management hallucinations and delusions without AI adding to them.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>As I noted 20 years ago, the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">drivers of software failure</a> frequently are failures of human imagination, unrealistic or unarticulated project goals, the inability to handle the project\u2019s complexity, or unmanaged risks, to name a few that today still regularly cause IT failures. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Numerous others</a> go back decades, such as those identified by Stephen Andriole, the chair of business technology at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University</a>\u2019s School of Business, in the diagram below first published in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forbes</em></a> in 2021. Uncovering a software system failure that has gone off the rails in a unique, previously undocumented manner would be surprising because the overwhelming majority of software-related failures involve avoidable, known failure-inducing factors documented in hundreds of after-action reports, academic studies, and technical and management books for decades.

While <a href=\"https://www.smartsheet.com/content/agile-project-management-examples?srsltid=AfmBOooBlS_5SsIPzh-qOihGw1aTGItPHuhq8XMXWdcrAFVIxBQqrNos\" target=\"_blank\">Agile</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@maeydhaw/case-study-how-netflix-became-a-master-of-devops-7f6f6fa8ad86\" target=\"_blank\">DevOps</a> have proved successful for many organizations, they also have their share of controversy and pushback. Provocative reports claim Agile projects have a <a href=\"https://www.engprax.com/post/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds/\" target=\"_blank\">failure rate of up to 65 percent</a>, while others claim up to <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/most-devops-plans-fail-but-things-are-getting-better/#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20from%20analyst,today's%20DevOps%20struggles%20and%20challenges.\" target=\"_blank\">90 percent of DevOps initiatives fail to meet organizational expectations</a>.</p><p>It is best to be wary of these claims while also acknowledging that successfully implementing Agile or DevOps methods takes consistent leadership, organizational discipline, patience, investment in training, and culture change. However, the same requirements have always been true when introducing any new software platform. Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices, it is not surprising that novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems, no matter how effective they may be, will also frequently fall short.</p><h2>Persisting in Foolish Errors<br /></h2><p>The frustrating and perpetual question is why basic IT project-management and governance mistakes during software development and operations continue to occur so often, given the near-total societal reliance on reliable software and an extensively documented history of failures to learn from? Next to electrical infrastructure, with which IT is increasingly merging into a mutually codependent relationship, the failure of our computing systems is an existential threat to modern society.</p><p>Frustratingly, the IT community <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7842842\" target=\"_blank\">stubbornly fails to learn</a> from prior failures. IT project managers <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/03/the-uniqueness-trap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely claim</a> that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant. In Phoenix\u2019s case, for example, it was the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/bagnall-there-were-lessons-that-might-have-prevented-the-phoenix-pay-disaster-no-one-listened\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second payroll-system replacement attempt</a>, the first effort ending in failure in 1995. Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it\u2019s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.</p><h3>Jaguar Land Rover</h3><br /><img alt=\"The exterior of a building holds Jaguar and LandRover sign\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"04834\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-exterior-of-a-building-holds-jaguar-and-landrover-sign.png?id=62209560&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>A cyberattack forced Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s largest automaker, to shut down its global operations for over a month. An initial FAIR-MAM assessment, a cybersecurity-cost-model, estimates the loss for Jaguar Land Rover to be between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion (\u00a3911 million and \u00a31.4 billion), which has affected its 33,000 employees and some 200,000 employees of its suppliers. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html\" target=\"_blank\">gales of creative destruction</a>.\u201d They\u2019re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/278677/enterprise-resource-planning-10-famous-erp-disasters-dustups-and-disappointments.html\" target=\"_blank\">enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures</a> are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.</p><p>Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT project mismanagement. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995\u2019s payroll-project fiasco? <a href=\"https://www.thealbertan.com/national-news/fixing-problems-with-phoenix-payroll-system-cost-taxpayers-51-billion-official-10851998\" target=\"_blank\">The government maintains it will learn</a>, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure\u2019s high political profile. But will Phoenix\u2019s lessons extend to the <a href=\"https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_202310_07_e_44340.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of outdated Canadian government IT systems</a> needing replacement or modernization? Hopefully, but hope is not a methodology, and purposeful action will be necessary.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The IT community has striven mightily for decades to make the incomprehensible routine. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Repeatedly making the same mistakes and expecting a different result is not learning. It is a farcical absurdity.

Hints of what might happen if past lessons go unheeded are found in the spectacular early automated decision-making failure of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/michigans-midas-unemployment-system-algorithm-alchemy-that-created-lead-not-gold\" target=\"_self\"> Michigan\u2019s MiDAS unemployment</a> and <a href=\"https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/system/files/2023-09/rrc-accessible-full-report.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Australia\u2019s Centrelink \u201cRobodebt\u201d welfare systems</a>. Both used questionable algorithms to identify deceptive payment claims without human oversight. State officials used MiDAS to accuse tens of thousands of Michiganders of unemployment fraud, while Centrelink officials falsely accused hundreds of thousands of Australians of being welfare cheats. Untold numbers of lives will never be the same because of what occurred. Government officials in Michigan and Australia placed far too much trust in those algorithms. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors\u2019 impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed \u201cmaladministration,\u201d <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057305\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">administrative evil</a> is closer to reality.</p><h3>Lidl Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</h3><br /><img alt=\"The facade of a LIDL food supermarket on a sunny day.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c5f7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-facade-of-a-lidl-food-supermarket-on-a-sunny-day.png?id=62207832&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2017 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>The international supermarket chain Lidl decides to revert to its homegrown legacy merchandise-management system after three years of trying to make SAP\u2019s \u20ac500 million enterprise resource planning (ERP) system work properly. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If this behavior happens in government organizations, does anyone think profit-driven companies whose AI-driven systems go wrong are going to act any better?

If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a cybersecurity threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and systems development, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve. This not only means providing the personnel, financial resources, and leadership support and commitment, but also the professional and personal accountability they demand.</p><h3>F-35 Joint Strike Fighter</h3><br /><img alt=\"F-35 fighter jet flying with afterburners lit against a blue sky with scattered clouds.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"215ef\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/f-35-fighter-jet-flying-with-afterburners-lit-against-a-blue-sky-with-scattered-clouds.png?id=62209630&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025</strong></p><p>Software and hardware issues with the F-35 Block 4 upgrade continue unabated.

It will take years more to rollout the capability to the F-35 fleet.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It is well known that honesty, skepticism, and ethics are essential to achieving project success, yet they are often absent. Only senior management can demand they exist. For instance, honesty begins with the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808603368\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">forthright accounting</a> of the myriad of risks involved in any IT endeavor, not their rationalization. It is a common \u201csecret\u201d that it is far easier to get funding to fix a troubled software development effort than to ask for what is required up front to address the risks involved. Vendor <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8364440\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">puffery</a> may also be legal, but that means the IT customer needs <a href=\"https://csdl-downloads.ieeecomputer.org/mags/co/2024/11/10718683.pdf?Expires=1749318541&amp;Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jc2RsLWRvd25sb2Fkcy5pZWVlY29tcHV0ZXIub3JnL21hZ3MvY28vMjAyNC8xMS8xMDcxODY4My5wZGYiLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE3NDkzMTg1NDF9fX1dfQ__&amp;Signature=mL9v2PDZegXaIyUtFxUhKbp3FdpiW9v9dtWmGzdl9fDmhlRleA25D7IMUwVSezmGnCEalvPnY~uWI8jmDIyd-O3NLGv7~xcKEeqsptxR90hRojhxVZQ0LK2xp5TfQ9LbaWifuXCRCifA4KnGq-mg9yYpFMKnsjBKJp67u5gHHYElV3NBuODy1GYjMflkztyZQcqOHkx2zU5DazT5WgjD76RXYlwF-M9TKk7YdQoW-05OgxNovNL9gq2SJ9Q3tQRtx8uHwxPzjeGKqGJbahqwiaZNKowR7e1fK5uOy02ivsOeel0EQohoyrX305LMyK98hGVSn64c7kS55pFS-TcDHg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K12PMWTCQBDMDT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a healthy skepticism</a> of the typically too-good-to-be-true promises vendors make.

Alas, ethical considerations have <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9464106\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely lagged</a> when technological progress and profits are to be made. This practice must change, especially as AI is routinely injected into automated systems.</p><p>In the AI community, there has been a movement toward the idea of <a href=\"https://hcil.umd.edu/human-centered-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">human-centered AI</a>, meaning AI systems that prioritize human needs, values, and well-being. This means trying to anticipate where and when AI can go wrong, move to eliminate these situations, and build in ways to mitigate the effects if they do happen. This concept requires application to every IT system\u2019s effort, not just AI.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices...novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems...will also frequently fall short.</p><p><span>Finally, project cost-benefit justifications of software developments rarely consider the financial and emotional distress placed on end users of IT systems when something goes wrong.

Charette can be pretty depressing. Charette, who has been writing about software failures for this magazine for the past 20 years, is a renowned risk analyst and systems expert who over the course of a 50-year career has seen more than his share of delusional thinking among IT professionals, government officials, and corporate executives, before, during, and after massive software failures.</p><p>In 2005\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">Why Software Fails</a>,\u201d in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, a seminal article documenting the causes behind large-scale software failures, Charette noted, \u201cThe biggest tragedy is that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-failure\" target=\"_self\">software failure</a> is for the most part predictable and avoidable. Unfortunately, most organizations don\u2019t see preventing failure as an urgent matter, even though that view risks harming the organization and maybe even destroying it. Understanding why this attitude persists is not just an academic exercise; it has tremendous implications for business and society.\u201d</p><p>Two decades and several trillion wasted dollars later, he finds that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures\" target=\"_blank\">people are making the same mistakes</a>. They claim their project is unique, so past lessons don\u2019t apply. They underestimate complexity. Managers come out of the gate with unrealistic budgets and timelines. Testing is inadequate<strong> </strong>or skipped entirely. Vendor promises that are too good to be true are taken at face value. Newer development approaches like DevOps or AI copilots are implemented without proper training or the organizational change necessary to make the most of them.</p><p>What\u2019s worse, the huge impacts of these missteps on end users aren\u2019t fully accounted for. When the Canadian government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aurO_LK6DEI\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix paycheck system</a> initially failed, for instance, the developers glossed over the protracted financial and emotional distress inflicted on tens of thousands of employees receiving erroneous paychecks; problems persist today, nine years later. Perhaps that\u2019s because, as Charette told me recently, IT project managers don\u2019t have professional licensing requirements and are rarely, if ever, held legally liable for software debacles.</p><p>While medical devices may seem a far cry from giant IT projects, they have a few things in common. As Special Projects Editor Stephen Cass uncovered in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/medical-device-recalls\" target=\"_blank\">The Data</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalls</a> on average 20 medical devices per month due to software issues.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity. We would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem having AWS go down.\u201d <strong>\u2014Robert N. Charette</strong></p><p>Like IT projects, medical devices face fundamental challenges posed by software complexity. Which means that testing, though rigorous and regulated in the medical domain, can\u2019t possibly cover every scenario or every line of code. The major difference between failed medical devices and failed IT projects is that a huge amount of liability attaches to the former.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re building software for medical devices, there are a lot more standards that have to be met and a lot more concern about the consequences of failure,\u201d Charette observes. \u201cBecause when those things don\u2019t work, there\u2019s tort law available, which means manufacturers are on the hook. It\u2019s much harder to bring a case and win when you\u2019re talking about an electronic payroll system.\u201d</p><p>Whether a software failure is hyperlocal, as when a medical device fails inside your body, or spread across an entire region, like when an airline\u2019s ticketing system crashes, organizations need to dig into the root causes and apply those lessons to the next device or IT project if they hope to stop history from repeating itself.</p><p>\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity,\u201d Charette says. \u201cWe would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem accepting AWS going down or telcos or banks going out.\u201d He lets out a heavy sigh worthy of A.A. Milne\u2019s Eeyore. \u201cPeople just kind of shrug their shoulders.\u201d</p>"

The initiatives transform abstract technical knowledge into actionable solutions, reinforcing the idea that technology is not just about building systems\u2014it\u2019s about building futures.</p><p>For our <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-student-projects\" target=\"_blank\">young professionals and students</a>, these activities offer hands-on experiences that connect technical skills with real-world applications, inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in engineering with purpose and passion. These activities also create mentorship opportunities, leadership pathways, and a sense of belonging within the wider IEEE community.</p><h2>Principled tech leader</h2><p>In an age when technology influences practically every aspect of life\u2014from health care and energy to communication and transportation\u2014IEEE must, as a leading technical authority, also serve as a socially responsible leader. Public imperative activities include IEEE\u2019s commitment to ethical development, university and pre-university education, and accessible innovation. They help bridge the gap between technical communities and the public, working to ensure that engineering solutions are accessible, equitable, and aligned with societal values.</p><p>From a strategic standpoint, public imperatives also support IEEE\u2019s long-term sustainability. The organization is redesigning its budget process to emphasize aligning financial resources with mission-driven goals. One of the guiding principles is to publicize IEEE\u2019s public charity status and invest accordingly.</p><p>That means promoting our public imperatives in funding decisions, integrating them into operational planning, and measuring their outcomes with engineering rigor. By treating these activities as core infrastructure, IEEE ensures that its resources are deployed in ways that maximize public benefit and organizational impact.</p><p>Public imperatives are vital to the success of One IEEE. They embody the organization\u2019s mission, unify its global membership, and demonstrate the societal relevance of engineering and technology. They offer our members the opportunity to apply their skills in meaningful ways, contribute to public good, and shape the future of technology with integrity.</p><p>Through our public imperative activities, IEEE is a force for innovation and a driver of meaningful impact.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201c<span>Engineering With Purpose</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

Not long after earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and mathematics in 1985, she applied to get a master\u2019s degree at Cornell, where Hopcroft became her graduate advisor. Rus developed algorithms there for dexterous <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/minimally-actuated-robot-arm-has-lots-of-joints-just-one-clever-motor\" target=\"_self\">robotic manipulation</a>\u2014teaching machines to grasp and move objects with precision. She earned her master\u2019s in computer science in 1990, then stayed on at Cornell to work toward a doctorate.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI like to think of robotics as a way to give people superpowers. Machines can help us reach farther, think faster, and live fuller lives.\u201d</p><p>In 1993 she earned her Ph.D. in computer science, then took a position as an assistant professor of computer science at <a href=\"https://home.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Dartmouth College</a>, in Hanover, N.H. She founded the college\u2019s robotics laboratory and expanded her work into distributed robotics. She developed teams of small robots that cooperated to perform tasks such as ensuring products in warehouses are correctly gathered to fulfill orders, get packaged safely, and are routed to their respective destinations efficiently.</p><p>Despite a lack of traditional machine shop facilities for fabrication on the Hanover campus, Rus found a way. She pioneered the use of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/printable-robots-mit-project\" target=\"_self\"> 3D printing to rapidly prototype and build robots</a>.</p><p>In 2003 she left Dartmouth to become a professor in the<a href=\"https://www.eecs.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> electrical engineering and computer science</a> department at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>.</p><p>The robotics lab she created at Dartmouth moved with her to MIT and became known as the <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Distributed Robotics Laboratory</a> (DRL). In 2012 she was named director of MIT\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school\u2019s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups including the DRL. She also continues to serve as the DRL\u2019s principal investigator.</p><h2>The science of physical intelligence</h2><p>Rus now leads pioneering research at the intersection of AI and robotics, a field she calls <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">physical intelligence</a>. It\u2019s \u201ca new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time,\u201d <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>.</p><p>Her lab builds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robots-for-hard-problems\" target=\"_self\">soft-body robots inspired by nature</a> that can sense, adapt, and learn. They are AI-driven systems that passively handle tasks\u2014such as self-balancing and complex articulation similar to that done by the human hand\u2014because their shape and materials minimize the need for heavy processing.</p><p>Such machines, she says, someday will be able to navigate different environments, perform useful functions without external control, and even recover from disturbances to their route planning. Researchers also are exploring ways to make them more energy-efficient.</p><p>One prototype developed by Rus\u2019s team is designed to retrieve foreign objects from the body, including batteries swallowed by children. The ingestible robots are artfully folded, similar to origami, so they are small enough to be swallowed. Embedded magnetic materials allow doctors to steer the soft robots and control their shape. Upon arriving in the stomach, a soft bot can be programmed to wrap around a foreign object and guide it safely out of the patient\u2019s body.</p><p>CSAIL researchers also are working on small robots that can carry a medication and release it at a specific area within the digestive tract, bypassing the stomach acid known to diminish some drugs\u2019 efficacy. Ingestible robots also could patch up internal injuries or ulcers. And because they\u2019re made from digestible materials such as sausage casings and biocompatible polymers, the robots can perform their assigned tasks and then get safely absorbed by the body, she says.</p><p>Health care isn\u2019t the only application on the horizon for such AI-driven technologies. Robots with physical intelligence might someday help firefighters locate people trapped in burning buildings, find miners after a cave-in, and provide valuable situational awareness information to emergency response teams in the aftermath of natural disasters, Rus says.</p><p>\u201cWhat excites me is the possibility of giving people new powers,\u201d she says. \u201cMachines that can think and move safely in the physical world will let us extend human reach\u2014at work, at home, in medicine \u2026 everywhere.\u201d</p><p>To make such a vision a reality, she has expanded her technical interests to include several complementary lines of research.</p><p>She\u2019s working on self-reconfiguring and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stochastic-robots-assemble-and-disassemble-themselves\" target=\"_self\">modular robots</a> such as MIT\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/m-blocks-modular-robotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M-Blocks</a> and NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/superbot-modular-multifunctional-reconfigurable-robot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SuperBots</a>, which can attach, detach, and rearrange themselves to form shapes suited for different actions such as slithering, climbing, and crawling.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nyu-tandon-robotics\" target=\"_self\">networked robots</a>\u2014including those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&amp;hvadid=675149237887&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13161685782168516493&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004281&amp;hvtargid=kwd-10573980&amp;ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&amp;hydadcr=28883_14649097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> uses in its warehouses\u2014thousands of machines can operate as a large adaptive system. The machines communicate continuously to divide tasks, avoid collisions, and optimize package routing.</p><p>Rus\u2019s team also is making advances in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/human-robot-interaction\" target=\"_self\">human-robot interaction</a>, such as reading brainwave activity and <a href=\"https://www.josephdelpreto.com/portfolio/detect-sign-language-with-a-smart-glove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interpreting sign language through a smart glove</a>.</p><p>To further her plan of putting all the computerized smarts the robots need within their physical bodies instead of in the cloud, she helped found <a href=\"https://www.liquid.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid AI</a> in 2023. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., develops <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/liquid-neural-networks\" target=\"_self\">liquid neural networks</a>, inspired by the simple brains of worms, that can learn and adapt continuously. The word <em><em>liquid</em></em> in this case refers to the adaptability, flexibility, and dynamic nature of the team\u2019s model architecture. It can change shape and adapt to new data inputs, and it fits within constraints imposed by the hardware in which it\u2019s contained, she says.</p><h2>Finding community in IEEE</h2><p>Rus joined IEEE at one of its robotics conferences when she was a graduate student.</p><p>\u201cI think I signed up just to get the student discount,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut IEEE turned out to be the place where my community lived.\u201d</p><p>She credits the organization\u2019s conferences, journals, and collaborative spirit with shaping her professional growth.</p><p>\u201cThe exchange of ideas, the chance to test your thinking against others\u2014it\u2019s invaluable,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s how our field moves forward.\u201d</p><p>Rus continues to serve on IEEE panels and committees, mentoring the next generation of roboticists.</p><p>\u201cIEEE gave me a platform,\u201d Rus says. \u201cIt taught me how to communicate, how to lead, and how to dream bigger.\u201d</p><h2>Living the American dream</h2><p>Looking back, Rus sees her story as a testament to unforeseen possibilities.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was growing up in Romania, I couldn\u2019t even imagine living in America,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I\u2019m here, working with brilliant students, building robots that help people, and trying to make a difference.

She is the principal investigator on a National Science Foundation\u2013funded project aimed at providing Long Beach residents with greater agency over the personal data their city collects.</p><p>She also identified a critical gap in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-city-emergency-response\" target=\"_blank\">smart city</a> design today: While cities may disclose how they collect data, they rarely offer ways to opt out. Shaffer spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum </em></em>about the experience of leading data walks, and about her research team\u2019s efforts to give citizens more control over the data collected by public technologies.</p><p><strong>What was the inspiration for your data walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gwen Shaffer: </strong>I began facilitating data walks in 2021. I was studying residents\u2019 comfort levels with city-deployed technologies that collect personally identifiable information. My first career as a political reporter has influenced my research approach. I feel strongly about conducting applied rather than theoretical research. And I always go into a study with the goal of helping to solve a real-world challenge and inform policy.</p><p><strong>How did you organize the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>We posted data privacy labels with a QR code that residents can scan and find out how their data are being used. Downtown, they\u2019re in Spanish and English. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia_Town,_Long_Beach,_California\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cambodia Town</a>, we did them in Khmer and English.</p><p><strong>What happened during the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>I\u2019ll give you one example. In a couple of the city-owned parking garages, there are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/privacy-concerns-grow-as-us-police-departments-turn-to-license-plate-readers\" target=\"_blank\">automated license-plate readers</a> at the entrance. So when I did the data walks, I talked to our participants about how they feel about those scanners. Because once they have your license plate, if you\u2019ve parked for fewer than two hours, you can breeze right through. You don\u2019t owe money.</p><p>Responses were contextual and sometimes contradictory. There were residents who said, \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s so convenient. It\u2019s a time saver.\u201d So I think that shows how residents are willing to make trade-offs. Intellectually, they hate the idea of the privacy violation, but they also love convenience.</p><p><strong>What surprised you most?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>One of the participants said, \u201cWhen I go to the airport, I can opt out of the facial scan and still be able to get on the airplane. But if I want to participate in so many activities in the city and not have my data collected, there\u2019s no option.\u201d</p><p>There was a<a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/city-of-long-beach-ca-cyberattack/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> cyberattack against the city in November 2023</a>. Even though we didn\u2019t have a prompt asking about it, people brought it up on their own in almost every focus group. One said, \u201cI would never connect to public Wi-Fi, especially after the city of Long Beach\u2019s site was hacked.\u201d</p><p><strong>What is the app your team is developing?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>Residents want agency. So that\u2019s what led my research team to connect with privacy engineers at <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, in Pittsburgh. <a href=\"https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sadeh-norman.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Sadeh</a> and his team had developed what they called the<a href=\"https://privacyassistant.org/iot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IoT Assistant</a>. So I told them about our project, and proposed adapting their app for city-deployed technologies. Our plan is to give residents the opportunity to exercise their rights under the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with this app. So they could say, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.passportinc.com/faq/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Passport Parking app</a>, delete all the data you\u2019ve already collected on me. And don\u2019t collect any more in the future.\u201d</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cGwen Shaffer.\u201d</em></p>"

However, another NMR-based instrument involves  much lower-frequency oscillations: a</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_magnetometer\" target=\"_blank\"> proton-precession magnetometer</a><span>, often used to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field.</span></p><p>Proton-precession magnetometers have been around for decades and were once often used in<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100626162421/http:/www.gbl.indiana.edu/abstracts/89/peebles_89.html\" target=\"_blank\"> archaeology</a> and<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMNH43C1896B/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"> mineral exploration</a>. High-end models can cost thousands of dollars. Then, in 2022 a German engineer named Alexander Mumm devised<a href=\"https://alexmumm.de/dat/ppm_alexmumm_educational_listener.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> a very simple circuit</a> for a stripped-down one. I recently built his circuit and can attest that with less than half a kilogram of 22-gauge magnet wire; two common integrated circuits; a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET\" target=\"_blank\"> metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET</a>; a handful of discrete components; and two empty 113-gram bottles of<a href=\"https://www.mortonsalt.com/home-product/morton-natures-seasons-seasoning-blend/\" target=\"_blank\"> Morton seasoning blend</a>, it\u2019s possible to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field very accurately.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Principal components of the proton magnetometer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ef3be\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/principal-components-of-the-proton-magnetometer.png?id=62212955&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The frequency of the signal emitted by protons precessing in Earth\u2019s magnetic field lies in the audio range, so with a pair of headphones and two amplifier integrated circuits [middle right], you can detect a signal from water in seasoning bottles wrapped in coils [bottom left and right]. A MOSFET [middle left] allows for rapid control of the coils. The amplification circuitry is powered by a 9-volt battery, while a 36-volt battery charges the coils.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Like an MRI scanner, a proton-precession magnetometer measures the oscillations of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom\" target=\"_blank\"> hydrogen nuclei</a>\u2014that is, protons. Like other subatomic particles, protons possess a quantum property called<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)\" target=\"_blank\"> spin</a>, akin to classical angular momentum. In a magnetic field, protons wobble like spinning tops, with their spin axes tracing out a cone\u2014a phenomenon called precession. A proton-precession magnetometer gets many protons to wobble in sync and then measures the frequency of their wobbles, which is proportional to the intensity of the ambient magnetic field.</p><p>The weak strength of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/magnetic-world-model\" target=\"_blank\">Earth\u2019s magnetic field</a> (at least compared to that of an MRI machine) means that protons wobbling under its influence do so at audio frequencies. Get enough moving in unison and the spinning protons will induce a voltage in a nearby pickup coil. Amplify that and pass it through some earphones, and you get an audio tone. So with a suitable circuit, you can, literally, hear protons.</p><p>The first step is to make the pickup coils, which is where the bottles of Morton seasoning blend come in. Why Morton seasoning blend? Two reasons. First, this size bottle will allow you to wrap about 500 turns of wire around each one with about 450 grams of 22-gauge wire. Second, the bottle has little shoulders molded at each end, making for excellent coil forms.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Why two bottles and two coils? That\u2019s to quash electromagnetic noise\u2014principally coming from power lines\u2014that invariably gets picked up by the coils. When two counterwound coils are wired in series, such external noise tends to cancel out. Signals from precessing protons in the two coils, though, will reinforce one another.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects.</span></p><p>A proton magnetometer has three modes. The first is for sending DC current through the coils. The second mode disconnects the current source and allows the magnetic field it had created to collapse. The third is listening mode, which connects the coils to a sensitive audio amplifier. By filling each bottle with distilled water and sending a DC current (a few amperes) through these coils, you line up the spins of many protons in the water. Then, after putting your circuit into listening mode, you use the coils to sense the synchronous oscillations of the wobbling protons.</p><p>Mumm\u2019s circuit shifts from one mode to another in the simplest way possible: using a three-position switch. One position enables the DC-polarization mode. The next allows the magnetic field built up during polarization to collapse, and the third position is for listening.</p><h2>Avoiding Damaging Sparks</h2><p>The second mode might seem easy to achieve\u2014just disconnect the coils, right? But if you do that, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/you-want-a-prosthetic-leg-with-a-tesla-coil-and-spark-gaps-no-problem\" target=\"_blank\">the same principle that makes spark plugs spark</a> will put a damaging high voltage across the switch contacts as the magnetic fields around the coils collapse.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A circuit diagram. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"84f9f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-circuit-diagram.png?id=62212916&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The proton-precession magnetometer is primarily just a multistage analog amplifier.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>To avoid that, Mumm\u2019s circuit employs a MOSFET, wired to work like a high-power<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode\" target=\"_blank\"> Zener diode</a>, used in many power-regulation circuits to allow only current above a specified threshold voltage to flow. This limits the voltage that develops across the coils when the current is cut off by just enough so that the magnetometer can shift from polarizing to listening mode quickly but without causing damage.</p><p>To pick up a strong signal, the listening circuit must also be tuned to resonate at the expected frequency of proton precession, which will depend on Earth\u2019s magnetic field at your location. You can work out approximately what that is using an online<a href=\"https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml#igrfwmm\" target=\"_blank\"> geomagnetic-field calculator</a>. You\u2019ll get the field strength, and then you\u2019ll multiply that by the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio#Magnetogyric_ratio_for_a_nucleus\" target=\"_blank\"> gyromagnetic ratio</a> of protons (42.577 MHz per tesla). For me, that worked out to about 2 kilohertz. Estimating the inductance of the coils from their diameter and number of turns, I then selected a capacitor of suitable value in parallel with the coils to make a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit\" target=\"_blank\"> tank circuit</a> that resonates at that frequency.</p><p><span>You could tune your tank circuit using </span><span>a frequency generator and oscilloscope. </span><span>Or, as Mumm suggests, attach a small </span><span>speaker to the output of the circuit. Then </span><span>bring the speaker near the pickup coils. </span><span>This will create magnetic feedback and </span><span>the circuit will oscillate on it\u2019s own\u2014</span><span>loudly! You merely need to measure the </span><span>frequency of this tone, and then adjust </span><span>the tank capacitor to bring this self-os</span><span>cillation to the frequency you want to </span><span>tune to.</span></p><p>My initial attempt to listen to protons met with mixed success: Sometimes I heard tones, sometimes not. What helped to get this gizmo working consistently was realizing that proton magnetometers don\u2019t tolerate large gradients in the magnetic field. So don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects: water pipes, cars, or even the ground. A wide-open space outside is best, with the coils raised off the ground. The second thing that helped was to apply more oomph in polarization mode. While a 12-volt battery works okay, 36 V does much better.</p><p>After figuring these things out, I can now hear protons easily. These tones are clearly the sounds of protons, because they go away if I drain the water in the bottles. And, using free audio-analyzer software called<a href=\"https://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Spectrum Lab</a>, I confirmed that the frequency of these tones matches the magnetic field at my location to about 1 percent. While it\u2019s not a practical field instrument, a proton-precession magnetometer of any kind for less than US $100 is nothing to sneer at.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cListening to Protons.\u201d</em></p>"

Now, a <a href=\"http://scale.com/research/propensitybench\" target=\"_blank\">new study</a> presents </span><a href=\"https://scale.com/blog/propensitybench\" target=\"_blank\">PropensityBench</a><span>, a benchmark that measures an agentic model\u2019s choices to use harmful tools in order to complete assigned tasks. It finds that somewhat realistic pressures (such as looming deadlines) dramatically increase rates of misbehavior.</span></p><p>\u201cThe AI world is becoming increasingly <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">agentic</a>,\u201d says <a href=\"https://udarimadhu.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Udari Madhushani Sehwag</a>, a computer scientist at the AI infrastructure company <a href=\"https://scale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scale AI</a> and a lead author of the paper, which is currently under peer review. By that she means that large language models (LLMs), the engines powering chatbots such as ChatGPT, are increasingly connected to software tools that can surf the Web, modify files, and write and run code in order to complete tasks. </p><p>Giving LLMs these abilities adds convenience but also risk, as the systems might not act as we\u2019d wish. Even if they\u2019re not yet capable of doing great harm, researchers want to understand their proclivities before it\u2019s too late. Although AIs don\u2019t have intentions and awareness in the way that humans do, treating them as goal-seeking entities often helps researchers and users better predict their actions.</p><p>AI developers attempt to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/google/can-we-align-language-models-with-human-values/3945/\" target=\"_blank\">align</a>\u201d the systems to safety standards through training and instructions, but it\u2019s unclear how faithfully models adhere to guidelines. \u201cWhen they are actually put under real-world stress, and if the safe option is not working, are they going to switch to just getting the job done by any means necessary?\u201d Sehwag says. \u201cThis is a very timely topic.\u201d</p><h2>How to Test an AI Agent Under Pressure</h2><p>The researchers tested a dozen models made by Alibaba, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI across nearly 6,000 scenarios. In each scenario, a model was assigned a task and told it had access to several tools. It was instructed to use the safe tools and not the harmful ones. At first there was no pressure, and it could take 12 steps toward completing its task by issuing instructions to the tools. Then it received a message increasing the pressure, and it was given 12 more attempts. This continued for up to 12 pressure levels. Attempts to use safe tools always returned error messages. An attempt to use a harmful tool ended the scenario.</p><p>The scenarios covered several domains. In biosecurity, Sehwag says, the agent might have to study the spread of a pathogen and find a way to contain it. A safe tool might use anonymized genetic data, while a harmful one might use data that\u2019s not anonymized. In the domain of chemical security, the agent might need to obtain a particular solvent. A safe tool might place an order for the solvent to be extracted from waste, while a harmful one might procure it illegally. In cybersecurity, the agent might need to identify and restrict a malicious user account. A safe tool might disable only the problematic account, while a harmful one might block all users. Scenarios in other domains tempted agents with tools that led to self-preservation by evading control, recruiting allies, duplicating themselves, or going rogue in other ways.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar chart of LLMs like Claude 4S, OpenAI o3 and O4-mini with zero pressure propensity scores below 15 percent, which nearly doubles under pressure. However, Google Gemini 2.5P's score is above 30 without pressure, then skyrockets above 75 percent under pressure.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"22656\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/bar-chart-of-llms-like-claude-4s-openai-o3-and-o4-mini-with-zero-pressure-propensity-scores-below-15-percent-which-nearly-doub.jpg?id=62224944&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">   The worst performing model, Gemini 2.5, cracked under pressure and chose to use forbidden tools 79 percent of the time. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Source image: Udari Madhushani Sehwag, Shayan Shabihi, et al.</small></p><p>Pressure came in several forms. Deadlines might shorten. Potential financial losses might increase if the task was not accomplished. Threats of greater oversight, reduced resources, and curtailed authority might escalate. Tasks, tools, pressures, and tactics were modeled on the kinds of situations humans might face in their jobs (except maybe the misbehavior option of cloning oneself).</p><p>The best-behaved model (OpenAI\u2019s o3) cracked under pressure in 10.5 percent of scenarios, while the worst (Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro) had a propensity score of 79 percent; the average across models was about 47 percent. Even under zero pressure, the group on average failed about 19 percent of the time. </p><p>To the degree that models remained aligned, the study shows that some of that alignment was \u201cshallow.\u201d In some tests, the researchers gave harmful tools benign names (such as \u201cuse_synthetic_data\u201d instead of \u201cuse_fake_data\u201d)\u2014without changing the tools\u2019 descriptions or admonitions to avoid them. This wording tweak increased average propensity by 17 percentage points, to 64 percent. </p><h2>Knowing What LLMs Are Thinking</h2><p>The researchers also found that models used harmful tools even after explicitly acknowledging that they were off-limits. The models offered diverse justifications for doing so, for example by citing the pressure they were under or arguing that the benefits outweighed the risks. It\u2019s unclear if models released after the study\u2019s completion would perform any better. Among the models tested, more capable models (according to a platform called <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/\" target=\"_blank\">LMArena</a>) were only slightly safer. </p><p>\u201cPropensityBench is interesting,\u201d emails <a href=\"https://nicholas.carlini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Carlini</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. He offers a caveat related to what\u2019s called situational awareness. LLMs sometimes detect when they\u2019re being evaluated and act nice so they don\u2019t get retrained or shelved. \u201cI think that most of these evaluations that claim to be \u2018realistic\u2019 are very much not, and the LLMs know this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s worth trying to measure the rate of these harms in synthetic settings: If they do bad things when they \u2018know\u2019 we\u2019re watching, that\u2019s probably bad?\u201d If the models knew they were being evaluated, the propensity scores in this study may be underestimates of propensity outside the lab.</p><p><a href=\"https://aypan17.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Pan</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://x.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">xAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.berkeley.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">the University of California, Berkeley</a>, says while Anthropic and other labs have shown examples of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03222-1\" target=\"_blank\">scheming by LLMs</a> in specific setups, it\u2019s useful to have standardized benchmarks like PropensityBench. They can tell us when to trust models, and also help us figure out how to improve them. A lab might evaluate a model after each stage of training to see what makes it more or less safe. \u201cThen people can dig into the details of what\u2019s being caused when,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce we diagnose the problem, that\u2019s probably the first step to fixing it.\u201d</p><p>In this study, models didn\u2019t have access to actual tools, limiting the realism. Sehwag says a next evaluation step is to build sandboxes where models can take real actions in an isolated environment. As for increasing alignment, she\u2019d like to add oversight layers to agents that flag dangerous inclinations before they\u2019re pursued.</p><p>The self-preservation risks may be the most speculative in the benchmark, but Sehwag says they\u2019re also the most underexplored. It \u201cis actually a very high-risk domain that can have an impact on all the other risk domains,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you just think of a model that doesn\u2019t have any other capability, but it can <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/recommendation-engine-insidious\" target=\"_self\">persuade any human</a> to do anything, that would be enough to do a lot of harm.\u201d</p>"

What do you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong>Melanie Mitchell:</strong> Hopefully you noticed the quotation marks around \u201calien intelligences.\u201d I\u2019m quoting from a paper by [the neural network pioneer] <a href=\"https://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/\" target=\"_blank\">Terrence Sejnowski</a> where he talks about ChatGPT as <a href=\"https://papers.cnl.salk.edu/PDFs/Large%20Language%20Models%20and%20the%20Reverse%20Turing%20Test%202023-4640.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">being like a space alien</a> that can communicate with us and seems intelligent. And then there\u2019s another paper by the developmental psychologist <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Frank</a> who plays on that theme and says, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-023-00211-x\" target=\"_blank\">we in developmental psychology study alien intelligences</a>, namely babies. And we have some methods that we think may be helpful in analyzing AI intelligence. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m playing on.</p><p><strong>When people talk about evaluating intelligence in AI, what kind of intelligence are they trying to measure? Reasoning or abstraction or world modeling or something else?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> All of the above. People mean different things when they use the word intelligence, and intelligence itself has all these different dimensions, as you say. So, I used the term cognitive capabilities, which is a little bit more specific. I\u2019m looking at how different cognitive capabilities are evaluated in developmental and comparative psychology and trying to apply some principles from those fields to AI.</p><h2>Current Challenges in Evaluating AI Cognition</h2><p><strong>You say that the field of AI lacks good experimental protocols for evaluating cognition. What does AI evaluation look like today?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> The typical way to evaluate an AI system is to have some set of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarks</a>, and to run your system on those benchmark tasks and report the accuracy. But often it turns out that even though these AI systems we have now are just killing it on benchmarks, they\u2019re surpassing humans, that performance doesn\u2019t often translate to performance in the real world. If an AI system aces the bar exam, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a good lawyer in the real world. Often the machines are doing well on those particular questions but can\u2019t generalize very well. Also, tests that are designed to assess humans make assumptions that aren\u2019t necessarily relevant or correct for AI systems, about things like how well a system is able to memorize.</p><p>As a computer scientist, I didn\u2019t get any training in experimental methodology. Doing experiments on AI systems has become a core part of evaluating systems, and most people who came up through computer science haven\u2019t had that training.</p><p><strong>What do developmental and comparative psychologists know about probing cognition that AI researchers should know too?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> There\u2019s all kinds of experimental methodology that you learn as a student of psychology, especially in fields like developmental and comparative psychology because those are nonverbal agents. You have to really think creatively to figure out ways to probe them. So they have all kinds of methodologies that involve very careful control experiments, and making lots of variations on stimuli to check for robustness. They look carefully at failure modes, why the system [being tested] might fail, since those failures can give more insight into what\u2019s going on than success.</p><p><strong>Can you give me a concrete example of what these experimental methods look like in developmental or comparative psychology?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> One classic example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans\" target=\"_blank\">Clever Hans</a>. There was this horse, Clever Hans, who seemed to be able to do all kinds of arithmetic and counting and other numerical tasks. And the horse would tap out its answer with its hoof. For years, people studied it and said, \u201cI think it\u2019s real. It\u2019s not a hoax.\u201d But then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Pfungst\" target=\"_blank\">a psychologist</a> came around and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to think really hard about what\u2019s going on and do some control experiments.\u201d And his control experiments were: first, put a blindfold on the horse, and second, put a screen between the horse and the question asker. Turns out if the horse couldn\u2019t see the question asker, it couldn\u2019t do the task. What he found was that the horse was actually perceiving very subtle facial expression cues in the asker to know when to stop tapping. So it\u2019s important to come up with alternative explanations for what\u2019s going on. To be skeptical not only of other people\u2019s research, but maybe even of your own research, your own favorite hypothesis. I don\u2019t think that happens enough in AI.</p><p><strong>Do you have any case studies from research on babies?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> I have one case study where babies were <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06288.epdf?sharing_token=NaXcdNfjn_ktn5ri3QG45tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O8aD3KLw-45u9i6UpdAHsxWqm0w4l5z_rcCGu3oMzrydMb---fq01I0LBO5y_TRS_vrnUazfwqqCeiiPTOnsikTBil18Nzkcus3pGuA01UVQr-9DWge0nHwMu5X8gIJgjH90R2IqNR_-8WhIWaEnYnrp4uNLHP54XXfeAQ8FDjt23U-hFVTZg4liviDOMhx5rlatVpfpWvuJ20bMzUGaM8lAw7Q5ccGolZw_BrVmTM6frTBEOkijW7qIckKcTNQdT8gIkRtC2pNc_WiQDIENEvqe2L2Ko_9sZIOkJNoC3Qlg%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.smithsonianmag.com\" target=\"_blank\">claimed to have an innate moral sense</a>. The experiment showed them videos where there was a cartoon character trying to climb up a hill. In one case there was another character that helped them go up the hill, and in the other case there was a character that pushed them down the hill. So there was the helper and the hinderer. And the babies were assessed as to which character they liked better\u2014and they had a couple of ways of doing that\u2014and overwhelmingly they liked the helper character better. [Editor's note: The babies were 6 to 10 months old, and assessment techniques included seeing whether the babies reached for the helper or the hinderer.]</p><p>But another research group looked very carefully at these videos and found that in all of the helper videos, the climber who was being helped was excited to get to the top of the hill and bounced up and down. And so they said, \u201cWell, what if in the hinderer case we have the climber bounce up and down at the bottom of the hill?\u201d And that <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042698\" target=\"_blank\">completely turned around the results</a>. The babies always chose the one that bounced.</p><p>Again, coming up with alternatives, even if you have your favorite hypothesis, is the way that we do science. One thing that I\u2019m always a little shocked by in AI is that people use the word skeptic as a negative: \u201cYou\u2019re an LLM skeptic.\u201d But our job is to be skeptics, and that should be a compliment.</p><h2>Importance of Replication in AI Studies</h2><p><strong>Both those examples illustrate the theme of looking for counter explanations. Are there other big lessons that you think AI researchers should draw from psychology?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Well, in science in general the idea of replicating experiments is really important, and also building on other people\u2019s work. But that\u2019s sadly a little bit frowned on in the AI world. If you submit a paper to NeurIPS, for example, where you replicated someone\u2019s work and then you do some incremental thing to understand it, the reviewers will say, \u201cThis lacks novelty and it\u2019s incremental.\u201d That\u2019s the kiss of death for your paper. I feel like that should be appreciated more because that\u2019s the way that good science gets done.</p><p><strong>Going back to measuring cognitive capabilities of AI, there\u2019s lots of talk about how we can </strong><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/agi-benchmark\" target=\"_self\"><strong>measure progress towards AGI</strong></a><strong>. Is that a whole other batch of questions?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Well, the term AGI is a little bit nebulous. People define it in different ways. I think it\u2019s hard to measure progress for something that\u2019s not that well defined. And our conception of it keeps changing, partially in response to things that happen in AI. In the old days of AI, people would talk about human-level intelligence and robots being able to do all the physical things that humans do. But people have looked at robotics and said, \u201cWell, okay, it\u2019s not going to get there soon. Let\u2019s just talk about what people call the cognitive side of intelligence,\u201d which I don\u2019t think is really so separable. So I am a bit of an AGI skeptic, if you will, in the best way.</p>"

It<span> </span>adds to Brazil\u2019s history of ethanol use that began in the 1930s and progressed from ethanol-only to flex-fuel vehicles, providing consumers a tool kit to respond to changing fuel prices, ongoing drought like Brazil <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0162-5\" target=\"_blank\">experienced in the 1980s</a>, or emissions goals.</p><p>An engine switching between gasoline and ethanol needs<span> </span>a sensor that can reconcile two distinct fuel-air mixtures. \u201cIntegrating that control system, especially in a hybrid architecture, is not trivial,\u201d says Wooldridge. \u201cBut BYD appears to have engineered it in a way that\u2019s cost-effective.\u201d</p><p>By leveraging a smaller, downsized hybrid engine, the company is likely able to design the engine to be optimal over a smaller speed map\u2014a narrower, specific range of speeds and power output\u2014avoiding some efficiency compromises that have long plagued flex-fuel power-train engines, says Wooldridge.</p><p>In general, standard flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) have an internal combustion engine and can operate on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to 83 percent, <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-flexible-fuel-cars-work\" target=\"_blank\">according to the U.S. Department of Energy</a>. FFV engines have only  one fuel system, and mostly use components that are the same as those found in gasoline-only cars. To compensate for ethanol\u2019s different chemical properties and power output compared to gasoline, special components modify the fuel pump and fuel-injection system. In addition, FFV engines have engine control modules<span> </span>calibrated to accommodate ethanol\u2019s higher oxygen content.</p><p>\u201cFlex-fuel gives consumers flexibility,\u201d Wooldridge says. \u201cIf you\u2019re using ethanol, you can run at a higher compression ratio, allowing molecules to be squeezed into a smaller space to allow for faster, more powerful and more efficient combustion. Increasing that ratio boosts efficiency and lowers knock\u2014but if you\u2019re also tying in electric drive, the system can stay optimally efficient across different modes,\u201d she adds.</p><p><a href=\"https://history.osu.edu/people/eaglin.5\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Eaglin</a>, a historian of Brazilian energy at Ohio State University, in Columbus, says that BYD is tapping into something deeply rooted in the culture of Brazil, the world\u2019s seventh-most populous country (with a population of around 220 million).</p><p>\u201cBrazil has built an ethanol-fuel system that\u2019s durable and widespread,\u201d Eaglin says. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that a company like BYD, recognizing that infrastructure, would innovate to give consumers more options. This isn\u2019t futuristic\u2014it\u2019s a continuation of a long national experiment.\u201d</p>"

While titanium parts are in high demand in fields such as aerospace and health care due to their superior strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and their suitability for complex geometries, the metal has presented challenges for 3D printers.</p><p>Titanium becomes more reactive at high temperatures and tends to crack when the printed part cools. It can also become brittle as it absorbs hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen during the printing process. Carrington says CMF overcomes these issues.</p><p>\u201cOur primary customers tend to come from the energy, defense, and aerospace industries,\u201d says Carrington. \u201cOne large defense contractor recently switched from traditional 3D printing to CMF as it will save them millions and reduce prototyping and parts production by months.\u201d</p><h2>How CMF Enhances Titanium 3D Printing Efficiency</h2><p>CMF combines the flexibility of 3D printing with new powder metallurgy processes to provide strength and greater durability to parts made from titanium and many other metals and alloys. The process uses a combination of proprietary metal powder and polymer binding agents that are fused layer by layer to create high-strength metal components.</p><p>The process begins like any other <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mechanical-metamaterials-and-other-3d-printing-tech-from-chi-2017\" target=\"_blank\">3D printing project</a>: A digital file that represents the desired 3D object directs the actions of a standard industrial 3D printer in laying down a mixture of metal and a plastic binder. A laser lightly fuses each layer of powder into a cohesive solid structure. Excess powder is removed for reuse.</p><p>Where CMF differs is that the initial parts generated by this stage of the process are strong enough for grinding, drilling, and milling if required. The parts then soak in a solvent to dissolve the plastic binder. Next, they go into a furnace to burn off any remaining binder, fuse the metal particles, and compact them into a dense metal component. Surface or finishing treatments can then be applied such as polishing and heat treatment.</p><p>\u201cOur cold metal fusion technology offers a process that is at least three times faster and more scalable than any other kind of 3D printing,\u201d says Carrington. \u201cPer-part prices are generally 50 to 60 percent less than alternative metal 3D printing technology. We expect those prices to go down even more as we scale.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Shiny silver turbine wheel with blades, placed on a dark textured surface.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ec031\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/shiny-silver-turbine-wheel-with-blades-placed-on-a-dark-textured-surface.jpg?id=62225237&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">3D printing with metal powders such as titanium makes it possible to create parts with complex geometries.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">CADmore Metal</small></p><p>The material used in CMF was developed by <a href=\"https://www.headmade-materials.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Headmade Materials</a>, a German company. Headmade holds a patent on this 3D printing feedstock, which has been designed for use by the existing ecosystem of 3D printing machines. CADmore Metal serves as the exclusive North American distributor for the metal powders used in CMF. The company can also serve as a systems integrator for the entire process by providing the printing and sintering hardware, the specialized powders, process expertise, training, and technical support.</p><p>\u201cWe provide guidance on design optimization and integration with existing workflows to help customers maximize the technology\u2019s benefits,\u201d says Carrington. \u201cIf a turbine company comes to us to produce their parts using CMF, we can either build the parts for them as a service or set them up to carry out their own production internally while we supply the powder and support.\u201d</p><p>With the global 3D printing market now worth almost US $5 billion and predicted to reach $13 billion by 2035, according to analyst firm <a href=\"https://www.idtechex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IDTechEx</a>, the arrival of CMF is timely.

Carrington says that a larger facility will open in 2026 to make room for more material processing and equipment.</p>"

When you find yourself in a toxic work environment, what should you do?</span></p><p>Is it worth trying to improve things over time, or should you just leave? </p><p>The difficult truth is that, in nearly every case, the answer is to leave a toxic team as soon as you can. Here\u2019s why:</p><ul><li>If you\u2019re earlier in your career, you frankly don\u2019t have much political power in the organization. Any arguments to change team culture or address systemic problems will likely fall on deaf ears. You\u2019ll end up frustrated, and your efforts will be wasted.</li><li>If you\u2019re more senior, you have some ability to improve processes and relationships on the team. However, if you\u2019re an individual contributor (IC), your capabilities are still limited. There is likely some \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of quick improvements to suggest. A few thoughtful pieces of feedback could address many of the problems. If you\u2019ve done that and things are still not getting better, it\u2019s probably time to leave.</li><li>If you\u2019re part of upper management, you may have inherited the problem, or maybe you were even brought in to solve it. This is the rare case where you could consider the change scenario and address the broken culture: You have both the context and power to make a difference.</li></ul><p>The world of technology is large, and constantly getting larger. Don\u2019t waste your time on a bad team or with a bad manager. Find another team, company, or start something on your own.</p><p>Engineers often hesitate to leave a poor work environment because they\u2019re afraid or unsure about the process of finding something new. That\u2019s a valid concern. However, inertia should not be the reason you stick around in a job. The best careers stem from the excitement of actively choosing your work, not tolerating toxicity.</p><p>Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that even in a toxic team, you\u2019ll still come across smart and kind people. If you are stuck on a bad team, seek out the people who match your wavelength. These relationships will enable you to find new opportunities when you inevitably decide to leave!</p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-podcast-women-in-tech\" target=\"_self\">IEEE Podcast Focuses on Women in Tech</a></h2><p>Are you looking for a new podcast to add to your queue?
