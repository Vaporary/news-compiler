Surveying approximately 9,000 households across five eurozone countries with varying debt-to-GDP ratios enables a clean cross-country comparison. The key finding is that the fiscal multiplier depends jointly on the financing method and the country\u2019s debt burden: multipliers are smaller in high-debt countries when debt-financed but remain similar across countries when tax-financed. Finally, we develop a New Keynesian model featuring fiscal discipline, which reproduces the empirical patterns observed in the survey and highlights their underlying economic mechanisms."

        "summary": "We study the long-run effects of a large public expansion of pre-primary educa- tion in Argentina. Between 1993 and 1999 the federal government financed the construction of new preschool classrooms targeted to departments with low base- line enrollment and high poverty, creating roughly 186,000 additional places. We link administrative records on classroom construction to four population censuses and estimate difference-in-differences models that compare treated and untreated cohorts across high- and low-construction departments. An additional preschool seat per child increases post-kindergarten schooling by about 0.5 years, raising the probability of completing secondary school by 11.9 percentage points and of enrolling in post-secondary education by 7.1 percentage points. For women, access to the program also reduces completed fertility: an additional seat lowers the number of live births per woman by 0.18, and we find no evidence that selective migration biases these estimates. We find little impact on labor-market outcomes at the census date, consistent with beneficiaries still being in school or in the early stages of their careers. A benefit-cost analysis based on the estimated schooling gains, standard Mincer returns, and observed construction and operating costs yields a benefit-cost ratio of about 11 and an internal rate of return of 13%. Our findings show that universal at-scale pre-primary expansions in middle-income countries can generate sizable improvements in human capital and demographic outcomes at relatively low fiscal cost."

This paper studies the labor market and health effects of c-sections, using newly linked administrative data that combines the universe of California birth records with mothers\u2019 quarterly earnings. We analyze the impact of an intervention that reduced c-section rates among low-risk first-time births, and find that mothers exposed to the intervention appear to have a higher likelihood of employment in the quarter following birth, as well as a higher likelihood of returning to their pre-birth employer. These impacts attenuate over time\u2014suggesting that a c-section primarily delays return to the labor market following childbirth\u2014but attachment to the pre-birth employer remains higher five quarters post-birth. We find no evidence of significant impacts on maternal or infant health, indicating that the intervention-induced decline in c-sections did not come at the cost of worse outcomes. Further, among mothers who have another child, we find that exposure to the intervention at the first birth leads to a lower likelihood of c-section and preterm delivery at the second one, implying that both the economic and health benefits of reduced c-sections may compound with birth order."

Although the existence of labor market power has long been recognized, evidence only recently emerged that such market power regularly arises from sources that are actionable under antitrust law. Since 2010, antitrust agencies have substantially increased labor market enforcement actions. However, many questions relevant to enforcement remain unanswered, such as how to conduct market definition for labor markets, and how best to incorporate concentration into models of the labor market. This article reviews how antitrust is beginning to be used in labor markets, the evidence for and against its use, and the remaining evidence gaps standing in the way of more effective use."

Using a standard framework of production heterogeneity, I show that the gap in productivity and distortions between high and low productivity firms is larger in developing countries, generating large aggregate productivity losses from misallocation. A key empirical property of distortions in developing countries is that they systematically weaken the relationship between firm size and firm productivity. I exploit a unique feature of the WBES data to document which specific aspects of the economic environment faced by firms, such as financial constraints, regulation, corruption, and weak infrastructure, are consistent with the empirical pattern of distortions across countries."

        "summary": "Private equity (PE) has moved rapidly into professional services, yet its impact on accounting, where licensing regimes, reputational capital, and partnership governance traditionally limit external ownership, remains poorly understood. We examine how PE ownership alters the organization and market structure of accounting firms using data from 1999-2024 that link more than 3,600 PE transactions to detailed information on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), labor markets, and audit pricing. PE investment increases sharply after 2020 and extends to both CPA-licensed audit firms and non-CPA advisory practices, with most activity in large mid-tier PCAOB-registered firms. After PE entry, firms grow faster: non-audit revenues rise, employment expands, and cross-state M&amp;A accelerates, consistent with platform-building and consolidation. These adjustments have market-level implications. PE investment raises labor-market concentration in key accounting occupations and drives up ERISA audit fees in a standardized setting, as confirmed by a synthetic difference-in-differences design. Our results reveal a key tension at the core of professions: preserving independence and competition in a market increasingly driven by financial capital."

The paper explores the effect of past reforms on inequality in old age.  We distinguish two separate effects: The mechanical effect considers the change in inequality and expected benefit levels due to the reforms for a fixed retirement age distribution. The behavioral effect accounts for the endogenous change caused by changes in the incentives to work. Our results show that mechanically, reforms have led to losses in expected benefits for all but the lowest income quintile. Behavioral changes had a positive but orders of magnitude smaller effect. Overall, inequality decreased as a result of reforms."

In general, a VPP pulls together many small components\u2014like rooftop solar, home batteries, and smart thermostats\u2014into a single coordinated power system. The system responds to grid needs on demand, whether by making stored energy available or reducing energy consumption by smart devices during peak hours.</p><p>VPPs <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-real-power\" target=\"_self\">had a moment</a> in the mid-2010s, but market conditions and the technology weren\u2019t quite aligned for them to take off. Electricity demand <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65264\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wasn\u2019t high enough</a>, and existing sources\u2014coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables\u2014met demand and kept prices stable. Additionally, despite the costs of hardware like solar panels and batteries falling, the software to link and manage these resources lagged behind, and there wasn\u2019t much financial incentive for it to catch up. </p><p>But times have changed, and less than a decade later, the stars are aligning in VPPs\u2019 favor. They\u2019re hitting a deployment inflection point, and they could play a significant role in meeting energy demand over the next 5 to 10 years in a way that\u2019s faster, cheaper, and greener than other solutions. </p><h2>U.S. Electricity Demand Is Growing</h2><p>Electricity demand in the United States is expected to <a href=\"https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/electricity-demand-expected-to-grow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">grow 25 percent</a> by 2030 due to data center buildouts, electric vehicles, manufacturing, and electrification, according to estimates from technology consultant ICF International.</p><p>At the same time, a host of bottlenecks are making it hard to expand the grid. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-data-centers\" target=\"_self\">backlog of at least</a> three to five years on new gas turbines.

This all adds up to a long, slow process to add generation and delivery capacity, and it\u2019s not getting faster anytime soon.</p><p> \u201cFueling electric vehicles, electric heat, and data centers solely from traditional approaches would increase rates that are already too high,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-heavner-9a63b311/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Heavner</a>, the executive director of the <a href=\"https://calssa.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Solar & Storage Association</a>. </p><p>Enter the vast network of resources that are already active and grid-connected\u2014and the perfect storm of factors that make now the time to scale them. <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/nasiri_adel.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adel Nasiri</a>, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of South Carolina, says variability of loads from data centers and electric vehicles has increased, as has deployment of grid-scale batteries and storage. There are more distributed energy resources available than there were before, and the last decade has seen advances in grid management using autonomous controls.</p><p>At the heart of it all, though, is the technology that stores and dispatches electricity on demand: batteries. </p><h2>Advances in Battery Technology</h2><p>Over the last 10 years, battery prices have plummeted: the average <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lithium-ion battery pack</a><a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> price</a> fell from US $715 per kilowatt-hour in 2014 to $115 per kWh in 2024. Their <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">energy density</a> has simultaneously increased thanks to a combination of materials advancements, design optimization of battery cells, and improvements in the packaging of battery systems, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-gross-b4a86714/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oliver Gross</a>, a senior fellow in energy storage and electrification at automaker Stellantis.</p><p>The biggest improvements have come in batteries\u2019 cathodes and electrolytes, with nickel-based cathodes starting to be used about a decade ago. \u201cIn many ways, the cathode limits the capacity of the battery, so by unlocking higher capacity cathode materials, we have been able to take advantage of the intrinsic higher capacity of anode materials,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregless/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Less</a>, the director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Battery Lab.</p><p>Increasing the percentage of nickel in the cathode (relative to other metals) increases energy density because nickel can hold more lithium per gram than materials like cobalt or manganese, exchanging more electrons and participating more fully in the redox reactions that move lithium in and out of the battery. The same goes for silicon, which has become more common in anodes. However, there\u2019s a trade-off: These materials cause more structural instability during the battery\u2019s cycling.</p><p>The anode and cathode are surrounded by a liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte has to be electrically and chemically stable when exposed to the anode and cathode in order to avoid safety hazards like thermal runaway or fires and rapid degradation. \u201cThe real revolution has been the breakthroughs in chemistry to make the electrolyte stable against more reactive cathode materials to get the energy density up,\u201d says Gross. Chemical compound additives\u2014many of them based on sulfur and boron chemistry\u2014for the electrolyte help create stable layers between it and the anode and cathode materials. \u201cThey form these protective layers very early in the manufacturing process so that the cell stays stable throughout its life.\u201d</p><p>These advances have primarily been made on electric vehicle batteries, which differ from grid-scale batteries in that EVs are often parked or idle, while grid batteries are constantly connected and need to be ready to transfer energy. However, Gross says, \u201cthe same approaches that got our energy density higher in EVs can also be applied to optimizing grid storage. The materials might be a little different, but the methodologies are the same.\u201d The most popular cathode material for grid storage batteries at the moment is lithium iron phosphate, or LFP.</p><p>Thanks to these technical gains and dropping costs, a domino effect has been set in motion: The more batteries deployed, the cheaper they become, which fuels more deployment and creates positive feedback loops.</p><p>Regions that have experienced frequent blackouts\u2014like parts of <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/07/18/texas-energy-grid-power-outages-climate-change-infrastructure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Texas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-11-06/edison-blacks-out-more-customers-to-stop-utility-sparked-fires\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/puerto-rico-earthquake-power-outages-prepa-news\" target=\"_self\">Puerto Rico</a>\u2014are a prime market for home batteries. Texas-based <a href=\"https://www.basepowercompany.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Base Power</a>, which raised $1 billion in Series C funding in October, installs batteries at customers\u2019 homes and becomes their retail power provider, charging the batteries when excess wind or solar production makes prices cheap, and then selling that energy back to the grid when demand spikes.</p><p>There is, however, still room for improvement. For wider adoption, says Nasiri, \u201cthe installed battery cost needs to get under $100 per kWh for large VPP deployments.\u201d</p><h2>Improvements in VPP Software</h2><p>The software infrastructure that once limited VPPs to pilot projects has matured into a robust digital backbone, making it feasible to operate VPPs at grid scale. Advances in AI are key: Many VPPs now use machine learning algorithms to predict load flexibility, solar and battery output, customer behavior, and grid stress events. This improves the dependability of a VPP\u2019s capacity, which was historically a major concern for grid operators.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a roof-top solar panel.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b3240\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-roof-top-solar-panel.jpg?id=62288941&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">While solar panels have advanced, VPPs have been held back by a lack of similar advancement in the needed software until recently.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sunrun</small></p><p>Cybersecurity and interoperability standards are still evolving. Interconnection processes and data visibility in many areas aren\u2019t consistent, making it hard to monitor and coordinate distributed resources effectively. In short, while the technology and economics for VPPs are firmly in place, there\u2019s work yet to be done aligning regulation, infrastructure, and market design.</p><p>On top of technical and cost constraints, VPPs have long been held back by regulations that prevented them from participating in energy markets like traditional generators. SolarEdge recently <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029315871/en/SolarEdge-Surpasses-500-MWh-of-Storage-in-Virtual-Power-Plants-Across-16-U.S.-States-Canada-and-Puerto-Rico\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> enrollment of more than 500 megawatt-hours of residential battery storage in its VPP programs. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamarasinensky/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tamara Sinensky</a>, the company\u2019s senior manager of grid services, says the biggest hurdle to achieving this milestone wasn\u2019t technical\u2014it was regulatory program design.</p><p>California\u2019s Demand Side Grid Support (<a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/demand-side-grid-support-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DSGS</a>) program, launched in mid-2022, pays homes, businesses, and VPPs to reduce electricity use or discharge energy during grid emergencies. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a massive increase in our VPP enrollments primarily driven by the DSGS program,\u201d says Sinensky. Similarly, Sunrun\u2019s Northern California VPP delivered 535 megawatts of power from home-based batteries to the grid in July, and saw a <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/sunrun-sees-400-growth-in-virtual-power-plant-participation/805169/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">400 percent increase</a> in VPP participation from last year.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-order-no-2222-explainer-facilitating-participation-electricity-markets-distributed-energy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FERC Order 2222</a>, issued in 2020, requires regional grid operators to allow VPPs to sell power, reduce load, or provide grid services directly to wholesale market operators, and get paid the same market price as a traditional power plant for those services. However, many states and grid regions don\u2019t yet have a process in place to comply with the FERC order. And because utilities profit from grid expansion and not VPP deployment, they\u2019re not incentivized to integrate VPPs into their operations. Utilities \u201cview customer batteries as competition,\u201d says Heavner.</p><p>According to Nasiri, VPPs would have a meaningful impact on the grid if they achieve a penetration of 2 percent of the market\u2019s peak power. \u201cLarger penetration of up to 5 percent for up to 4 hours is required to have a meaningful capacity impact for grid planning and operation,\u201d he says.</p><p>In other words, VPP operators have their work cut out for them in continuing to unlock the flexible capacity in homes, businesses, and EVs. Additional technical and policy advances could move VPPs from a niche reliability tool to a key power source and grid stabilizer for the energy tumult ahead.<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>"

He was of sound mind. But when it came to his health device, he couldn\u2019t find clear answers about where his data went, who could access it, or how to control it. The instructions were dense, and the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/protecting-online-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">privacy settings</a> were buried in multiple menus. So, he made what seemed like the safest choice: he unplugged it. That decision meant giving up real-time glucose monitoring that his doctor had recommended.</p><p>The healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) market is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iot-healthcare-market-worth-289-140000086.html\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> to exceed $289 billion by 2028, with older adults representing a major share of users. These devices are fall detectors, medication reminders, glucose monitors, heart rate trackers, and others that enable independent living. Yet there\u2019s a widening gap between deployment and adoption. According to an <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/personal-technology/companies-address-online-privacy-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\">AARP survey</a>, 34% of adults over 50 list privacy as a primary barrier to adopting health technology. That represents millions of people who could benefit from monitoring tools but avoid them because they don\u2019t feel safe.</p><p>In my study at the University of Denver\u2019s Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science, I surveyed 22 older adults and conducted in-depth interviews with nine participants who use health-monitoring devices. The findings revealed a critical engineering failure: 82% understood security concepts like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/two-factor-authentication-sandia-labs\" target=\"_blank\">two-factor authentication</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/homomorphic-encryption\" target=\"_blank\">encryption</a>, yet only 14% felt confident managing their privacy when using these devices. In my research, I also evaluated 28 healthcare apps designed for older adults and found that 79% lacked basic breach-notification protocols.</p><p>One participant told me, \u201cI know there\u2019s encryption, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really enough to protect my data.\u201d Another said, \u201cThe thought of my health data getting into the wrong hands is very concerning. I\u2019m particularly worried about identity theft or my information being used for scams.\u201d</p><p>This is not a user knowledge problem; it\u2019s an engineering problem. We\u2019ve built systems that demand technical expertise to operate safely, then handed them to people managing complex health needs while navigating age-related changes in vision, cognition, and dexterity.</p><h2>Measuring the Gap</h2><p>To quantify the issues with privacy setting transparency, I developed the Privacy Risk Assessment Framework (PRAF), a tool that scores healthcare apps across five critical domains.</p><p>First, the regulatory compliance domain evaluates whether apps explicitly state adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or other data protection standards. Just claiming to be compliant is not enough\u2014they must provide verifiable evidence.</p><p>Second, the security mechanisms<strong> </strong>domain assesses the implementation of encryption, access controls, and, most critically, breach-notification protocols that alert users when their data may have been compromised. Third, in the usability and accessibility domain, the tool examines whether privacy interfaces are readable and navigable for people with age-related visual or cognitive changes. Fourth, data-minimization practices evaluate whether apps collect only necessary information and clearly specify retention periods. Finally, third-party sharing transparency measures whether users can easily understand who has access to their data and why.</p><p>When I applied PRAF to 28 healthcare apps commonly used by older adults, the results revealed systemic gaps. Only 25% explicitly stated HIPAA compliance, and just 18% mentioned GDPR compliance. Most alarmingly, 79% lacked breach notification protocols, which means that the users may never find out if their data was compromised. The average privacy policy readability scored at a 12th-grade level, even though <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16541986/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research shows</a> that the average reading level of older adults is at an 8th grade level<strong>. </strong>Not a single app included accessibility accommodations in their privacy interfaces.</p><p>Consider what happens when an older adult opens a typical health app. They face a multi-page privacy policy full of legal terminology about \u201cdata controllers\u201d and \u201cprocessing purposes,\u201d followed by settings scattered across multiple menus. One participant told me, \u201cThe instructions are hard to understand, the print is too small, and it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d Another explained, \u201cI don\u2019t feel adequately informed about how my data is collected, stored, and shared. It seems like most of these companies are after profit, and they don\u2019t make it easy for users to understand what\u2019s happening with their data.\u201d</p><p>When protection requires a manual people can\u2019t read, two outcomes follow: they either skip security altogether leaving themselves vulnerable, or abandon the technology entirely, forfeiting its health benefits.</p><h2>Engineering for privacy</h2><p>We need to treat trust as an engineering specification, not a marketing promise. Based on my research findings and the specific barriers older adults face, three approaches address the root causes of distrust.</p><p>The first approach is adaptive security defaults. Rather than requiring users to navigate complex configuration menus, devices should ship with pre-configured best practices that automatically adjust to data sensitivity and device type. A fall detection system doesn\u2019t need the same settings as a continuous glucose monitor. This approach draws from the principle of \u201csecurity by default\u201d in systems engineering.</p><p>Biometric or voice authentication can replace passwords that are easily forgotten or written down. The key is removing the burden of expertise while maintaining strong protection. As one participant put it: \u201cSimplified security settings, better educational resources, and more intuitive user interfaces will be beneficial.\u201d</p><p>The second approach is real-time transparency<strong>.</strong> Users shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings to see where their data goes. Instead, notification systems should show each data access or sharing event in plain language. For example: \u201cYour doctor accessed your heart-rate data at 2 p.m. to review for your upcoming appointment.\u201d A single dashboard should summarize who has access and why.</p><p>This addresses a concern that came up repeatedly in my interviews: users want to know who is seeing their data and why. The engineering challenge here isn\u2019t technical complexity, it\u2019s designing interfaces that convey technical realities in language anyone can understand. Such systems already exist in other domains; banking apps, for instance, send immediate notifications for every transaction. The same principle applies to health data, where the stakes are arguably higher.</p><p>The third approach is invisible security updates. Manual patching creates vulnerability windows. Automatic, seamless updates should be standard for any device handling health data, paired with a simple status indicator so users can confirm protection at a glance. As one participant said, \u201cThe biggest issue that we as seniors have is the fact that we don\u2019t remember our passwords... The new technology is surpassing the ability of seniors to keep up with it.\u201d Automating updates removes a significant source of anxiety and risk.</p><h2>What\u2019s at Stake</h2><p>We can keep building healthcare IoT the way we have: fast, feature-rich, and fundamentally untrustworthy. Or, we can engineer systems that are transparent, secure, and usable by design. Trust isn\u2019t something you market through slogans or legal disclaimers. It\u2019s something you engineer, line by line, into the code itself.<strong> </strong>For older adults relying on technology to maintain independence, that kind of engineering matters more than any new feature we could add. Every unplugged glucose monitor, every abandoned fall detector, every health app deleted out of confusion or fear represents not just a lost sale but a missed opportunity to support someone\u2019s health and autonomy.</p><p>The challenge of privacy in healthcare IoT goes beyond fixing existing systems, it requires reimagining how we communicate privacy itself. My ongoing research builds on these findings through an AI-driven Data Helper, a system that uses large language models to translate dense legal privacy policies into short, accurate, and accessible summaries for older adults. By making data practices transparent and comprehension measurable, this approach aims to turn compliance into understanding and trust, thus advancing the next generation of trustworthy digital health systems.</p>"

The company will be handing over all of its assets to its Chinese manufacturing partner, Picea. According to iRobot\u2019s press release, \u201cthis agreement represents a critical step toward strengthening iRobot\u2019s financial foundation and positioning the Company for long-term growth and innovation,\u201d which sounds like the sort of thing that you put in a press release when you\u2019re trying your best to put a positive spin on really, really bad news.</span></p><p>This whole situation started back in August 2022, when iRobot <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-irobot-acquisition\" target=\"_self\">announced</a> a US $1.7 billion acquisition by Amazon. Amazon\u2019s interest was obvious\u2014some <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ring-indoor-security-drone\" target=\"_self\">questionable hardware decisions</a> had left the company struggling to enter the home robotics market. And iRobot was at a point where it needed a new strategy to keep ahead of lower-cost (and increasingly innovative) home robots from China.</p><p>Some folks were skeptical of this acquisition, and admittedly, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-irobot-acquisition\" target=\"_self\">I was one of them</a>. My primary worry was that iRobot would get swallowed up and effectively cease to exist, which tends to happen with acquisitions like these, but regulators in the United States had much more pointed concerns: namely, that Amazon would <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-jones-lawmakers-call-on-ftc-to-oppose-amazons-proposed-165-billion-acquisition-of-irobot\" target=\"_blank\">leverage its marketplace power to restrict competition</a>. The European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5990\" target=\"_blank\">expressed similar objections</a>.</p><p>By late January 2024, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-amazon\" target=\"_self\">the deal had fallen through</a>, iRobot laid off a third of its staff, suspended research and development, and CEO and cofounder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinangle/\" target=\"_blank\">Colin Angle</a> left the company. Since then, iRobot has seemed resigned to its fate, coasting along on a few lackluster product announcements and not much else, and so Sunday\u2019s announcement of bankruptcy was a surprise to no one\u2014perhaps least of all to Angle.</p><h2>iRobot\u2019s Bankruptcy and Amazon Deal Collapse</h2><p>\u201ciRobot\u2019s bankruptcy filing was really just a public-facing outcome of the tragedy that happened a year and a half ago,\u201d Angle told <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> on Monday. \u201cToday sucks, but I\u2019ve already mourned. I mourned when the deal with Amazon got blocked for all the wrong reasons.\u201d Angle points out that by the early 2020s, iRobot was no longer monopolizing the robot-vacuum market. This was especially true in Europe, where iRobot\u2019s market share was 12 percent and decreasing. But from Angle\u2019s perspective, regulators were more focused on making a point about Big Tech than they were about the actual merits and risks of the merger. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A suited man with short blonde hair and glasses holds a round black robot vacuum in a hallway covered in patents.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5ec16\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-suited-man-with-short-blonde-hair-and-glasses-holds-a-round-black-robot-vacuum-in-a-hallway-covered-in-patents.jpg?id=62593550&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cofounder Colin Angle says that iRobot\u2019s bankruptcy filing was unsurprising after a failed acquisition by Amazon a year and a half ago.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Charles Krupa/AP</small></p><p>\u201cWe were roadkilled in a larger agenda,\u201d Angle says. \u201cAnd this kind of regulation is incredibly destructive to the innovation economy. The whole concept of starting a tech company and having it acquired by a bigger tech company is far and away the most common positive outcome. For that to be taken away is not a good thing.\u201d And for iRobot, it was fatal. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268854\" target=\"_blank\">common criticism</a> of iRobot even before the attempted Amazon merger is that the company was simply being out-innovated in the robot-vacuum space, and Angle doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree. \u201cBy 2020, China had become the largest market in the world for robot vacuums, and Chinese robotics companies with government support were investing two or three times as much as iRobot was in R&amp;D. We simply didn\u2019t have the capital to move as quickly as we wanted to. In order for iRobot to continue to innovate and lead the industry, we needed to do so as part of a larger entity, and Amazon was very aligned with our vision for the home.\u201d</p><p>This situation is not unique to iRobot, and there is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm\" target=\"_blank\">significant concern in robotics</a><strong> </strong>about how companies can effectively compete against the massive advantage that China has in the production of low-cost hardware. In some sense, what happened to iRobot is an early symptom of what Angle (<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm\" target=\"_self\">and others</a>) see as a fundamental problem with robotics in the United States: lack of government support. In China, <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/11/embodied-ai-china-smart-robots\" target=\"_blank\">long-term government support for robotics and embodied AI</a> (in the form of both policy and direct investment)  can be found across industry and academia, something that neither the United States nor the European Union has been able to match. <span>\u201cRobotics is in a global competition against some very fearsome competitors,\u201d Angle says.</span><span> \u201c</span><span>We have to decide whether we want to support our innovation economy. And if the answer is no, then the innovation economy g</span><span>oes elsewhere.\u201d</span></p><p>The consequence of companies like iRobot losing this competition can be more than just bankruptcy. In iRobot\u2019s case, a Chinese company now owns iRobot\u2019s intellectual property and app infrastructure, which gives it access to data from millions of highly sensorized autonomous mobile robots in homes across the world. I asked Angle whether or not Roomba owners should be concerned about this. \u201cWhen I was running the company, we talked a lot about this, and put a lot of effort into privacy and security,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was fundamental to Roomba\u2019s design. Now, I can\u2019t speak to what they\u2019ll prioritize.\u201d</p><p>While Angle has moved on from iRobot, and has since cofounded a more-mysterious-than-we\u2019d-like company called <a href=\"https://www.familiarmachines.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Familiar Machines and Magic</a>, he still feels strongly that what has happened to iRobot should be a warning to both robotics companies and policymakers. \u201cMake no mistake: China is good at robots. So we need to play this hard. There\u2019s a lot to learn from what we did at iRobot, and a lot of ways to do it better.\u201d</p>On a personal note, I\u2019m choosing to remember the iRobot that was\u2014not just the company that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-roomba-history\" target=\"_self\">built a robot vacuum out of nothing</a> and conquered the world with it for nearly two decades, but also the company that built the <a href=\"https://robotsguide.com/robots/packbot\" target=\"_blank\">PackBot</a> to save lives, as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUd1miyCn5I\" target=\"_blank\">all of these other crazy robots</a>. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s ever been a company quite like iRobot, and there may never be again. It will be missed."

Entire cities lost electricity in the middle of the day. In the bustling airports of Madrid, Barcelona, and other key hubs, departure boards went blank. No power. No Internet. Even mobile phone service\u2014something most people take for granted\u2014was severely compromised. It was just disconnection and disruption. On the roads, traffic lights stopped functioning, snarling traffic and leaving people wondering when the power would return.</p><p>The size and scale of the impact were unsettling, but the scariest part was the speed at which it happened. Within minutes, the whole of the Iberian Peninsula\u2019s energy generation dropped from roughly 25GW to less than 1.2GW.</p><p> While this may sound like a freak accident, incidents like this will continue to happen, especially given the rapid changes to the electrical grid over the past few decades. Worldwide, power systems are evolving from large centralized generation to a multitude of diverse, distributed generation sources, representing a major paradigm shift. This is not merely a \u201cpower\u201d problem but is also a \u201csystems\u201d problem. It involves how all the parts of the power grid interact to maintain stability, and it requires a holistic solution.</p><p>Power grids are undergoing a massive transformation\u2014from coal- and gas-fired plants to millions of solar panels and wind turbines scattered across vast distances. It\u2019s not just a technology swap. It\u2019s a complete reimagining of how electricity is generated, transmitted, and used. And if we get it wrong, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for more catastrophic blackouts like the one that hit all of Spain and Portugal. The good news is that a solution developed by our group at <a href=\"https://www.iit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> over the last two decades and commercialized by our company, <a href=\"http://www.syndem.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Syndem</a>, has achieved global standardization and is moving into large-scale deployment. It\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.syndem.com/Products.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Synchronous Machines</a>, and it might be the key to keeping the lights on as we transition to a renewable future.</p><h2>Rapid Deployment of Renewable Energy</h2><p>The<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) created a <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Net Zero</a> by 2050 roadmap that calls for nearly 90% of global electricity generation to come from renewable, distributed sources, with <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/solar-pv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solar photovoltaic (PV</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/wind\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wind</a> accounting for almost 70%. We are witnessing firsthand a paradigm shift in power systems, moving from centralized to distributed generation.</p><p>The IEA projects that <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">renewable power installations will more than double between 2025 and 2030</a>, underscoring the urgent need to integrate renewables smoothly into existing power grids. A key technical nuance is that many distributed energy resources (DERs) produce direct current (DC) electricity, while the grid operates on alternating current (AC). To connect these resources to the grid, inverters convert DC into AC. To understand this further, we need to discuss inverter technologies.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An array of touch screens and Syndem converters in a control room.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3b7b2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-array-of-touch-screens-and-syndem-converters-in-a-control-room.jpg?id=62297380&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Professor Beibei Ren\u2019s team at Texas Tech University built modules for a SYNDEM test bed with 12 modules and a substation module, consisting of 108 converters. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Beibei Ren/Texas Tech University</small></p><p>Most of the inverters currently deployed in the field directly control the current (power) injected to the grid while constantly following the grid voltage, often referred to as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy-transition\" target=\"_blank\">grid-following inverters</a>. Therefore, this type of inverter is a current source, meaning that its current is controlled, but its terminal voltage is determined by what it connects to. Grid-following inverters rely on a stable grid to inject power from renewable sources and operate properly. This is not a problem when the grid is stable, but it becomes one when the grid is less stable. For instance, when the grid goes down or experiences severe disturbances, grid-following inverters typically trip off, meaning they don\u2019t provide support when the grid needs them most.</p><p>In recent years, attempts to address grid instability have led to the rise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-inverter\" target=\"_blank\">grid-forming inverters.</a> As the name suggests, these inverters could help form the grid. These usually refer to an inverter that controls its terminal voltage, including both the amplitude and frequency, which indirectly controls the current injected into the grid. This inverter behaves as a voltage source, meaning that its terminal voltage is regulated, but its current is determined by what it is connected to. Unlike grid-following inverters, grid-forming inverters can operate independently from the grid. This makes them useful in situations where the grid goes down or isn\u2019t available, such as during blackouts. They can also help balance supply and demand, support voltage, and even restart parts of the grid if it shuts down. </p><p>One issue is that the term \u201cgrid-forming\u201d means different things to different people. Some of them lack clear physical meaning or robust performance under complex grid conditions. Many grid-forming controls are model-based and may not scale properly in large systems. As a result, the design and control of these inverters can vary significantly. Grid-forming inverters made by different companies may not be interoperable, especially in large or complex power systems, which can include grid-scale battery systems, high-voltage DC (HVDC) links, solar PV panels, and wind turbines. The ambiguity of the term is increasingly becoming a barrier for grid-forming inverters, and no standards have been published yet.</p><h2>Systemic Challenges when Modernizing the Grid</h2><p>Let\u2019s zoom out for a moment to examine the broader landscape of structural challenges we need to address when transitioning today\u2019s grid into its future state. This transition is often called the <em><em>democratization of power systems</em></em>. Just as in politics, where democracy means everyone has a say, this transition in power systems means that every grid player can play a role. The primary difference between a political democracy and a power system is that the power system needs to maintain the stability of its frequency and voltage. If we apply a purely democratic approach to manage the power grid, it will sow the seeds for potential systemic failure.</p><p>The second systemic challenge is compatibility. The current power grid was designed long ago for a few big power plants\u2014not for millions of small, intermittent energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines. Ideally, we\u2019d build a whole new grid to fit today\u2019s needs, but that would bring too much disruption, cost too much, and take too long. The only feasible option is to somehow make various grid players compatible with the grid. To better conceptualize this, think about the invention of the modem, which solved the compatibility issues between computers and telephone systems, or the widespread adoption of USB ports. These inventions made many devices, such as cameras, printers, and phones, compatible with computers.</p><p>The third systemic challenge is scalability. It\u2019s one thing to hook up a few solar panels to the grid. It\u2019s entirely different to connect millions of them and still keep everything running safely and reliably. It\u2019s like walking one large dog versus walking hundreds of Chihuahuas at once. It is crucial for future power systems to adopt an architecture that can operate at different scales, allowing a power grid to break into smaller grids when needed or reconnect to operate as one grid, all autonomously. This is crucial to ensure resilience during extreme weather events, natural disasters, and/or grid faults.</p><p>To address these systemic challenges, the technologies need to undergo a seismic transformation. Today\u2019s power grids are electric-machine-based, with electricity generated by large synchronous machines in centralized facilities, often with slow dynamics. Tomorrow\u2019s grid will run on power electronic converters\u2014small, distributed, and with fast dynamics. It\u2019s a significant change, and one we need to plan carefully for.</p><h2>The Key is Synchronization</h2><p>Traditional fossil fuel power plants use synchronous machines to generate electricity, as they can inherently synchronize with each other or the grid when connected. In other words, they autonomously regulate their speeds and the grid frequency around a preset value, meeting a top requirement of power systems. This synchronization mechanism has underpinned the stable operation and organic expansion of power grids for over a century. So, preserving the synchronization mechanism in today\u2019s grids is crucial for addressing the systemic challenges as we transition from today\u2019s grid into the future.</p><p>Unlike traditional power plants, inverters are not inherently synchronous, but they need to be. The key enabling technology is called v<a href=\"http://www.syndem.com/Products.html\" target=\"_blank\">irtual synchronous machines</a> (VSMs). These are not actual machines, but instead are power electronic converters controlled through special software codes to behave like physical turbines. You can think of them as having the body of power converters with the brain of the older spinning synchronous machines. With VSMs, distributed energy resources can synchronize and support the grid, especially when something unexpected happens.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"clear box with a green circuit board and some copper coils.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ece07\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/clear-box-with-a-green-circuit-board-and-some-copper-coils.jpg?id=62297364&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Syndem\u2019s all-in-one reconfigurable and reprogrammable power electronic converter educational kit.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">SYNDEM</small></p><p>This naturally addresses the systemic challenges of compatibility and scalability. Like conventional synchronous machines, distributed energy resources are now compatible with the grid and can be integrated at any scale. But it gets better. First, inverters can be added to existing power systems without major hardware changes. Second, VSMs support the creation of small, local energy networks\u2014known as microgrids\u2014that can operate independently and reconnect to the main grid when needed. This flexibility is particularly useful during emergencies or power outages. Lastly, VSMs provide an elegant solution for the common concern about inertia, traditionally provided by large spinning machines that help cushion the grid against sudden changes. By design, VSMs can offer similar or even better characteristics of inertia.</p><p>VSMs are poised to become mainstream in the coming decade, driven in part by the backing of a global standard. After years of hard work, IEEE approved and published the first global standard on VSM, <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2988/10581/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Standard 2988-2024</a>. It involved members affiliated with key manufacturers, including <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">General Electric</a>, <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hitachi Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.se.com/us/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Schneider Electric</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eaton</a>, in addition to regulators and utilities, including <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a> (NERC), <a href=\"https://www.misoenergy.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Midcontinent Independent System Operator</a> (MISO), <a href=\"https://www.nationalgridus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Grid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sce.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Southern California Edison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.duke-energy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Duke Energy Corporation</a>, and <a href=\"https://energinet.dk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Energinet</a>.</p><h2>The Holistic SYNDEM Architecture</h2><p>Until now, much of the expert discourse has focused primarily on energy generation. But that\u2019s only half of the equation\u2014the other half is demand: how different loads consume the electricity. Their behavior also plays a crucial role in maintaining grid stability, in particular when generation is powered by intermittent renewable energy sources.</p><p>There are many different loads, including motors, Internet devices, and lighting, among others. They are physically different, but technically have one thing in common: They will all have a rectifier at the front end because motor applications are more efficient with a motor drive, which consists of a rectifier; and Internet devices and LED lights consume DC electricity, which needs rectifiers at the front end as well. Like inverters, these rectifiers can also be controlled as VSMs, with the only difference being the direction of the power flow. Rectifiers consume electricity while inverters supply electricity.</p><p>As a result, most generation and consumption facilities in a future grid can be equipped and unified with the same synchronization mechanism to maintain grid stability in a <a href=\"https://resourcecenter.ieee-pels.org/education/webinars/pelsweb032018v#:~:text=Qing%2DChang%20Zhong&amp;text=Power%20systems%20are%20going%20through,syndem.com%20for%20more%20details.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">synchronized-and-democratized</a> (SYNDEM) manner. Yes, you read that correctly. Even devices that use electricity\u2014like motors, computers, and LED lights\u2014can play a similar active role in regulating the grid by autonomously adjusting their power demand according to instantaneous grid conditions. A less critical load can adapt its power demand by a larger percentage as needed, even up to 100%. In comparison, a more critical load can adjust its power demand at a smaller percentage or maintain its power demand. As a result, the power balance in a SYNDEM grid no longer depends predominantly on adjusting the supply but on dynamically adjusting both the supply and the demand, making it easier to maintain grid stability with intermittent renewable energy sources.</p><p>For many loads, it is often not a problem to adjust their demand by 5-10% for a short period. Cumulatively, this offers significant support for the grid. Due to the rapid response of VSM, the support provided by such loads is equivalent to inertia and/or spinning reserve\u2014extra power from synchronized generators not at full load. This can reduce the need for large spinning reserves that are currently necessary in power systems and reduce the effort to coordinate generation facilities. It also mitigates the impact of dwindling inertia caused by the retirement of conventional large generating facilities.</p><p>In a SYNDEM grid, all active grid players, regardless of size, whether conventional or renewable, supplying or consuming, would follow the same SYNDEM rule of law and play the same equal role in maintaining grid stability, democratizing power systems, and paving the way for autonomous operation. It is worth highlighting that the autonomous operation can be achieved without relying on communication networks or human intervention, lowering costs and improving security.</p><p>The SYNDEM architecture takes VSMs to new heights, addressing all three systemic challenges mentioned above: democratization, compatibility, and scalability. With this architecture, you can stack grids at different scales, much like building blocks. Each home grid can be operated on its own, multiple home grids can be connected to form a neighborhood grid, and multiple neighborhood grids can be connected to create a community grid, and so on. Moreover, such a grid can be decomposed into smaller grids when needed and can reconnect to form a single grid, all autonomously, without changing codes or issuing commands.</p> The holistic theory is established, the enabling technologies are in place, and the governing standard is approved. However, the full realization of VSMs within the SYNDEM architecture depends on joint ventures and global deployment. This isn\u2019t a task for any one group alone. We must act together. Whether you\u2019re a policymaker, innovator, investor, or simply someone who cares about keeping the lights on, you can play a role. Join us to make power systems worldwide stable, reliable, sustainable, and, eventually, fully autonomous."

Ghost, a company which originated at the <a href=\"https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania</a>, specializes in exceptionally rugged quadrupeds, and while many of its customers use its robots for public safety and disaster relief, it also <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/274841/promising_experiment_signals_future_integration_of_advanced_tech_into_army_units\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">provides robots</a> to the United States military, which has very specific needs when it comes to keeping humans out of danger.</p><p>In that context, it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that Ghost\u2019s robots may sometimes be used to carry weapons, and despite the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-killer-drones\" target=\"_self\">proliferation of robots</a> in many roles in the Ukraine war, the idea of a legged robot carrying a weapon is not a comfortable one for many people. <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> spoke with Ghost co-founder and current CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-kenneally-321a3833/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gavin Kenneally</a> to learn more about the new arm, and to get his perspective on selling robots to the military.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Green military robot dog opens a wooden door with articulated arm.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a501b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/green-military-robot-dog-opens-a-wooden-door-with-articulated-arm.jpg?id=62304622&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Vision 60\u2019s new arm  has six degrees of freedom. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Robots for the Military</h2><p>Ghost Robotics initially made a name for itself with its very impressive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-minitaur-quadruped\" target=\"_self\">early work with the Minitaur direct-drive quadruped</a> in 2016. The company also made headlines in late 2021, when a now-deleted post on Twitter (now X) went viral because it included a photograph of one of Ghost\u2019s Vision 60 quadrupeds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-armed-military-robots\" target=\"_self\">with a rifle mounted on its back</a>.</p><p>That picture resulted in a <a href=\"https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/news/koditscheks-letter-to-ghosts-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">very strong reaction</a>, although as <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> reported at the time, robots with guns affixed to them wasn\u2019t new: To mention one early example, the U.S. military had already deployed weapons on mobile robots <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/04/armed-robots-st/\" target=\"_blank\">in Iraq in 2007</a>. And while several legged robot companies <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative\" target=\"_self\">pledged in 2022 not to weaponize their general purpose robots</a>, the Chinese military <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/30/chinese-armys-latest-weapon-gun-toting-dog\" target=\"_blank\">in 2024 displayed</a> quadrupeds from Unitree equipped with guns. (Unitree, based in China, was one of the signers of the 2022 pledge.)</p><p>The issue of weaponized robots goes far beyond Ghost Robotics, and far beyond robots with legs. We\u2019ve covered both the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots\" target=\"_self\">practical</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-path-towards-reasonable-autonomous-weapons-regulation\" target=\"_self\">ethical</a> perspectives on this extensively at <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, and the intensity of the debates show that there is no easy answer. But to summarize one important point made by some ethicists, some military experts, and Ghost Robotics itself: robots are replaceable, humans are not. \u201cCustomers use our robots to keep people out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Ghost CEO Kenneally tells <em><em>Spectrum.</em></em></p><p>It\u2019s also worth pointing out that even the companies who signed the pledge not to weaponize their general purpose robots <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative\" target=\"_self\">acknowledge</a> that military robots exist, and are accepting of that, provided that such robots are used under existing legal doctrines and operate within those safeguards\u2014and that what constraints should or should not be imposed on these kinds of robots is best decided by policymakers rather than industry.</p><p>This is essentially Ghost Robotics\u2019 position as well, says Kenneally. \u201cWe sell our robots to U.S. and allied governments, and as part of that, the robots are used in defense applications where they will sometimes be weaponized. What\u2019s most critical to us is that the decisions about how to use these robots are happening systematically and ethically at the government policy level.\u201d</p><p>To some extent, these decisions are already being made within the U.S. government. <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jan/25/2003149928/-1/-1/0/DOD-DIRECTIVE-3000.09-AUTONOMY-IN-WEAPON-SYSTEMS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Defense Directive 3000.09</a>, \u2018Autonomy in Weapon Systems,\u2019 lays out the responsibilities and limitations for how autonomous or human-directed robotics weapons systems should be developed and deployed, including requirements for human use-of-force judgements. At least in the U.S., this directive implies that there are rules and accountability for robotic weapons.</p><p></p><h2>Vision 60\u2019s Versatile Arm Capabilities</h2><p>Ghost sees its Vision 60 quadruped as a system that its trusted customers can use as they see fit, and the manipulator enables many additional capabilities. \u201cThe primary purpose of the robot has been as a sensor platform,\u201d Kenneally says, \u201cbut sometimes there are doors in the way, or objects that need to be moved, or you might want the robot to take a sample. So the ability to do all of that mobile manipulation has been hugely valuable for our customers.\u201d</p><p>As it turns out, arms are good for more than manipulation. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been very interesting is that our customers have been using the arm as a sensor boom, which is something that we hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d says Kenneally. Ghost\u2019s robot has plenty of cameras, but they\u2019re mostly at the viewpoint of a moderately-sized dog. The new arm offers a more human-like vantage and a way to peek around corners or over things without exposing the whole robot.</p><p>Ghost was not particularly interested in building their own arm, and tried off-the-shelf options to get the manipulation bit working. And they did get the manipulation working; what didn\u2019t work were any of those arms after the 50 kilogram robot rolled over on them. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that we could build an arm that could stand up to the same intense rigors of our customers\u2019 operations that the rest of the robot can,\u201d says Kenneally. \u201cMorphologically, we actually consider the arm to be a fifth leg, so that the robot operates as a unified system for whole-body control.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the robot is exceptionally rugged, which is what makes it appealing to customers with unique needs, like special forces teams. Enough battery life for more than three hours of walking (or more than 20 hours on standby) isn\u2019t bad, and the Vision 60 is sealed against sand and dust, and can survive complete submergence in shallow water. It can operate in extreme temperatures ranging from -40 \u00b0C to 55 \u00b0C, which has been a particular challenge for robots. And if you do manage to put it in a situation where it physically breaks one of its legs, it\u2019s easy to swap in a spare in just a few minutes, even out in the field.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Robotic dog opening a glass door with its arm in front of a building.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"724f7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/robotic-dog-opening-a-glass-door-with-its-arm-in-front-of-a-building.jpg?id=62304623&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Vision 60 can open doors withe high-level direction from a human operator.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Quadruped Robot Competition From China</h2><p>Despite Ghost quietly selling over a thousand quadrupeds to date, Kenneally is cautious about the near future for legged robots, as is anyone who has seriously considered buying one, because it\u2019s impossible to ignore the option of just buying one from a Chinese company at about a tenth the cost of a quadruped from a company based in the U.S. or Europe.</p><p>\u201cChina has identified legged robotics as a lynchpin technology that they are strategically funding,\u201d Kenneally says. \u201cI think it\u2019s an extremely serious threat in the long term, and we have to take these competitors very seriously despite their current shortcomings.\u201d There is a technological moat, for now, but if the market for legged robots follows the same trajectory as the market for drones did, that moat will shrink drastically over the next few years.</p><p>The United States is poised to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-dronemaker-dji-urges-us-complete-security-review-2025-12-04/\" target=\"_blank\">ban consumer drone sales from Chinese manufacturer DJI</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/08/us-army-just-ordered-soldiers-stop-using-drones-chinas-dji/139999/\" target=\"_blank\">banned DJI drone use by federal agencies in 2017</a>. But it may be too late in some sense, as DJI\u2019s global market share is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/26/1094249/china-commercial-drone-dji-security/\" target=\"_blank\">something like 90 percent</a>. Meanwhile, Unitree may have already cornered <a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/quadruped-state-of-the-market-unitree\" target=\"_blank\">somewhere around 70 percent</a> of the global market for quadrupeds, despite <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit\" target=\"_self\">the recent publication of exploits</a> that allow the robots to send unauthorized data to China.</p><p>In the United States in particular, private sector robotics funding is unpredictable at the best of times, and Kenneally argues that to compete with Chinese-subsidized robot-makers American companies like Ghost who produce these robots domestically will need sustained U.S. government support, too. That doesn\u2019t mean the government has to pick which companies will be the winners, but that it should find a way to support the U.S. robotics industry as a whole, if it still wants to have a meaningful one. \u201cThe quadruped industry isn\u2019t a science project anymore,\u201d says Kenneally. \u201cIt\u2019s matured, and quadruped robots are going to become extremely important in both commercial and government applications. But it\u2019s only through continued innovation that we\u2019ll be able to stay ahead.\u201d</p>"

These <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/grid-enhancing-technologies\" target=\"_self\">grid-enhancing technologies</a>, or GETs, present a low-cost way to bridge the gap until new lines can be built.</p><p>\u201cGETs allow us to operate the system harder before an investment arrives, and they save a s***load of money,\u201d says <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/julian-leslie-b9059535?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Julian Leslie</a>, chief engineer and director of strategic energy planning at the National Energy System Operator (NESO), the Warwick-based agency that directs U.K. energy markets and infrastructure.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A stone wall along a dirt trail with large powerlines running overhead on a sunny day \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3c272\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-stone-wall-along-a-dirt-trail-with-large-powerlines-running-overhead-on-a-sunny-day.jpg?id=62286810&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Transmission lines running across England\u2019s countryside are maxed out, creating bottlenecks in the grid that prevent some carbon-free power from reaching customers. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Vincent Lowe/Alamy </small></p><p>The U.K.\u2019s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment. Such innovation involves some risk, because an intervention anywhere on the U.K.\u2019s tightly meshed power system can have system-wide impacts. (Grid operators elsewhere are choosing to start with GETs at their systems\u2019 periphery\u2014where there\u2019s less impact if something goes wrong.)</p><p>The question is how far\u2014and how fast\u2014the U.K.\u2019s grid operators can push GETs capabilities. The new technologies still have a limited track record, so operators are cautiously feeling their way toward heavier investment. Power system experts also have unanswered questions about these advanced grid capabilities. For example, will they create more complexity than grid operators can manage in real time? Might feedback between different devices destabilize the grid?</p><p>There is no consensus yet as to how to even screen for such risks, let alone protect against them, says <a href=\"https://www.robinpreece.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Preece</a>, professor in future power systems at the University of Manchester, in England. \u201cWe\u2019re at the start of establishing that now, but we\u2019re building at the same time. So it\u2019s kind of this race between the necessity to get this technology installed as quickly as possible, and our ability to fully understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><h2>How is the U.K. Managing Grid Congestion?</h2><p>One of the most innovative and high-stakes tricks in the U.K.\u2019s toolbox employs electronic power-flow controllers, devices that shift electricity from jammed circuits to those with spare capacity. These devices have been able to finesse enough additional wind power through grid bottlenecks to replace an entire gas-fired generator. Installed in northern England four years ago by <a href=\"https://www.smartwires.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Wires</a>, based in Durham, N.C., these SmartValves are expected to help even more as NESO installs more of them and masters their capabilities.</p><p>Warwick-based <a href=\"https://www.nationalgrid.com/electricity-transmission\" target=\"_blank\">National Grid Electricity Transmission</a>, the grid operator for England and Wales, is adding SmartValves and also replacing several thousand kilometers of overhead wire with advanced conductors that can carry more current. And it\u2019s using a technique called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/dynamic-line-rating-grid-congestion\" target=\"_self\">dynamic line rating</a>, whereby sensors and models work together to predict when weather conditions will allow lines to carry extra current.</p><p>Other kinds of GETs are also being used globally. Advanced conductors are the most widely deployed. Dynamic line rating is increasingly common in European countries, and U.S. utilities are beginning to take it seriously. Europe also leads the world in topology-optimization software, which reconfigures power routes to alleviate congestion, and advanced power-flow-control devices like SmartValves.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers wearing hard hats and safety harnesses standing high up on an electricity pylon in the countryside\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4a9a9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-wearing-hard-hats-and-safety-harnesses-standing-high-up-on-an-electricity-pylon-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286977&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Engineers install dynamic line rating technology from the Boston-based company LineVision on National Grid\u2019s transmission network. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p>SmartValves\u2019 chops stand out at the Penwortham substation in Lancashire, England, one of two National Grid sites where the device made its U.K. debut in 2021. Penwortham substation is a major transmission hub, whose spokes desperately need congestion relief. Auditory evidence of heavy power flows was clear during my visit to the substation, which buzzes loudly. The sound is due to the electromechanical stresses on the substation\u2019s massive transformers, explains my guide, National Grid commissioned engineer Paul Lloyd.</p><p>Penwortham\u2019s transformers, circuits, and protective relays are spread over 15 hectares, sandwiched between pastureland and suburban homes near Preston, a small city north of Manchester. Power arrives from the north on two pairs of 400-kilovolt AC lines, and most of it exits southward via 400-kV and 275-kV double-circuit wires.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Power lines crossing a rural pasture, with an old fence in the foreground and a substation in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ce7e1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/power-lines-crossing-a-rural-pasture-with-an-old-fence-in-the-foreground-and-a-substation-in-the-background.jpg?id=62286959&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Transmission lines lead to the congested Penwortham substation, which has become a test-bed for GETs such as  SmartValves and dynamic line rating. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Peter Fairley </small></p><p>What makes the substation a strategic test-bed for GETs is its position just north of the U.K. grid\u2019s biggest bottleneck, known as Boundary B7a, which runs east to west across the island. Nine circuits traverse the B7a: the four AC lines headed south from Penwortham, four AC lines closer to Yorkshire\u2019s North Sea coast, and a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link offshore. In theory, those circuits can collectively carry 13.6 gigawatts across the B7a. But NESO caps its flow at several gigawatts lower to ensure that no circuits overload if any two lines turn off.</p><p>Such limits are necessary for grid reliability, but they are leaving terawatt-hours of wind power stranded in Scotland and increasing consumers\u2019 energy costs: an extra \u00a3196 million (US $265 million) in 2024 alone. The costs stem from NESO having to ramp up gas-fired generators to meet demand down south while simultaneously compensating wind-farm operators for curtailing their output, as required under U.K. policy.</p><p>So National Grid keeps tweaking Penwortham. In 2011 the substation got its first big GET: phase-shifting transformers (PSTs), a type of analog flow controller. PSTs adjust power flow by creating an AC waveform whose alternating voltage leads or lags its alternating current. They do so by each PST using a pair of connected transformers to selectively combine power from an AC transmission circuit\u2019s three phases. Motors reposition electrical connections on the transformer coils to adjust flows.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Large machines outdoors connected to power lines \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d09c1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/large-machines-outdoors-connected-to-power-lines.jpg?id=62286963&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Phase-shifting transformers (PSTs) were installed in 2012 at the Penwortham substation and are the analog predecessor to SmartValves. They\u2019re powerful but also bulky and relatively inflexible. It can take 10 minutes or more for the PST\u2019s motorized actuators at Penwortham to tap their full range of flow control, whereas SmartValves can shift within milliseconds.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p><span>Penwortham\u2019s pair of 540-tonne PSTs occupy the entire south end of the substation, along with their dedicated chillers, relays, and power supplies. Delivering all that hardware required extensive road closures and floating a huge barge up the adjacent River Ribble, an event that made national news.</span></p><p>The SmartValves at Penwortham stand in stark contrast to the PSTs\u2019 heft, complexity, and mechanics. SmartValves are a type of static synchronous series compensator, or SSSC\u2014a solid-state alternative to PSTs that employs power electronics to tweak power flows in milliseconds. I saw two sets of them tucked into a corner of the substation, occupying a quarter of the area of the PSTs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers on an elevated platform and tall, cylindrical machinery\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"146f3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-on-an-elevated-platform-and-tall-cylindrical-machinery.jpg?id=62286971&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The SmartValve V103 design [above] experienced some teething and reliability issues that were ironed out with the technology\u2019s next iteration, the V104.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            National Grid Electricity Transmission/Smart Wires        </small> </p><p>The SmartValves are first and foremost an insurance policy to guard against a potentially crippling event: the sudden loss of one of the B7a\u2019s 400-kV lines. If that were to happen, gigawatts of power would instantly seek another route over neighboring lines. And if it happened on a windy day, when lots of power is streaming in from the north, the resulting surge could overload the 275-kV circuits headed from Penwortham to Liverpool. The SmartValves\u2019 job is to save the day.</p><p>They do this by adding impedance to the 275-kV lines, thus acting to divert more power to the remaining 400-kV lines. This rerouting of power prevents a blackout that could potentially cascade through the grid. The upside to that protection is that NESO can safely schedule an additional 350 MW over the B7a.</p><p>The savings add up. \u201cThat\u2019s 350 MW of wind you\u2019re no longer curtailing from wind farms. So that\u2019s 350 times \u00a3100 a megawatt-hour,\u201d says Leslie, at NESO. \u201cThat\u2019s also 350 MW of gas-fired power that you don\u2019t need to replace the wind. So that\u2019s 350 times \u00a3120 a megawatt-hour. The numbers get big quickly.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266637500\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Osborne</a>, the National Grid lead asset life-cycle engineer managing its SmartValve projects, estimates the devices are saving U.K. customers over \u00a3100 million (US $132 million) a year. At that rate, they\u2019ll pay for themselves \u201cwithin a few years,\u201d Osborne says. By utility standards, where investments are normally amortized over decades, that\u2019s \u201calmost immediately,\u201d he adds.</p><h2>How Do Grid-Enhancing Technologies Work?</h2><p>The way Smart Wires\u2019 SSSC devices adjust power flow is based on emulating impedance, which is a strange beast created by AC power. An AC flow\u2019s changing magnetic field induces an additional voltage in the line\u2019s conductor, which then acts as a drag on the initial field. Smart Wires\u2019 SSSC devices alter power flow by emulating that natural process, effectively adding or subtracting impedance by adding their own voltage wave to the line. Adding a wave that leads the original voltage wave will boost flow, while adding a lagging wave will reduce flow.</p><p>The SSSC\u2019s submodules of capacitors and high-speed insulated-gate bipolar transistors operate in sequence to absorb power from a line and synthesize its novel impedance-altering waves. And thanks to its digital controls and switches, the device can within milliseconds flip from maximum power push to maximum pull.</p><p>You can trace the development of SSSCs to the advent of HVDC transmission in the 1950s. HVDC converters take power from an AC grid and efficiently convert it and transfer it over a DC line to another point in the same grid, or to a neighboring AC grid. In 1985, Narain Hingorani, an HVDC expert at the Palo Alto\u2013based Electric Power Research Institute, showed that similar converters could modulate the flow of an AC line. Four years later, Westinghouse engineer Laszlo Gyugyi proposed SSSCs, which became the basis for Smart Wires\u2019 boxes.</p><p>Major power-equipment manufacturers tried to commercialize SSSCs in the early 2000s. But utilities had little need for flow control back then because they had plenty of conventional power plants that could meet local demand when transmission lines were full.</p><p>The picture changed as solar and wind generation exploded and conventional plants began shutting down. In years past, grid operators addressed grid congestion by turning power plants on or off in strategic locations. But as of 2024, the U.K. had shut down all of its coal-fired power plants\u2014save one, which now burns wood\u2014and it has vowed to slash gas-fired generation from about a quarter of electricity supply in 2024 to at most 5 percent in 2030.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">The U.K.\u2019s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment.</p><p>To seize the emerging market opportunity presented by changing grid operations, Smart Wires had to make a crucial technology upgrade: ditching transformers. The company\u2019s first SSSC, and those from other suppliers, relied on a transformer to absorb lightning, voltage surges, and every other grid assault that could fry their power electronics. This made them bulky and added cost. So Smart Wires engineers set to work in 2017 to see if they could live without the transformer, says Frank Kreikebaum, Smart Wires\u2019s interim chief of engineering. Two years later the company had assembled a transformerless electronic shield. It consisted of a suite of filters and diverters, along with a control system to activate them. Ditching the transformer produced a trim, standardized product\u2014a modular system-in-a-box.</p><p>SmartValves work at any voltage and are generally ganged together to achieve a desired level of flow control. They can be delivered fast, and they fit in the kinds of tight spaces that are common in substations. \u201cIt\u2019s not about cost, even though we\u2019re competitive there. It\u2019s about \u2018how quick\u2019 and \u2018can it fit,\u2019\u201d says Kreikebaum.</p><p>And if the grid\u2019s pinch point shifts? The devices can be quickly moved to another substation. \u201cIt\u2019s a Lego-brick build,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-wilkes/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Owen Wilkes</a>, National Grid\u2019s director of network design. Wilkes\u2019s team decides where to add equipment based on today\u2019s best projections, but he appreciates the flexibility to respond to unexpected changes.</p><p>National Grid\u2019s deployments in 2021 were the highest-voltage installation of SSSCs at the time, and success there is fueling expansion. National Grid now has packs of SmartValves installed at three substations in northern England and under construction at another, with five more installations planned in that area. Smart Wires has also commissioned commercial projects at transmission substations in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and the United States.</p><h2>Dynamic Line Rating Boosts Grid Efficiency</h2><p>In addition to SSSCs, National Grid has deployed lidar that senses sag on Penwortham\u2019s 275-kV lines\u2014an indication that they\u2019re starting to overheat. The sensors are part of a dynamic line rating system and help grid operators maximize the amount of current that high-voltage lines can carry based on near-real-time weather conditions. (Cooler weather means more capacity.) Now the same technology is being deployed across the B7a\u2014a \u00a31 million investment that is projected to save consumers \u00a333 million annually, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/corin-ireland-4040b2179/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Corin Ireland</a>, a National Grid optimization engineer with the task of seizing GETs opportunities.</p><p>There\u2019s also a lot of old conductor wires being swapped out for those that can carry more power. National Grid\u2019s business plan calls for 2,416 kilometers of such reconductoring over the coming five years, which is about 20 percent of its system. Scotland\u2019s transmission operators are busy with their own big swaps.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rural farmland with shape and rotating wind turbines \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"80b0b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rural-farmland-with-shape-and-rotating-wind-turbines.jpg?id=62286812&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Scottish wind farms have doubled their power output over the past decade, but it often gets stranded due to grid congestion in England.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Andreas Berthold/Alamy        </small> </p><p>But while National Grid and NESO are making some of the boldest deployments of GETs in the world, they\u2019re not fully tapping the technologies\u2019 capabilities. That\u2019s partly due to the conservative nature of power utilities, and partly because grid operators already have plenty to keep their eyes on. It also stems from the unknowns that still surround GETs, like whether they might take the grid in unforeseen directions if allowed to respond automatically, or get stuck in a feedback loop responding to each other. Imagine SmartValve controllers at different substations fighting, with one substation jumping to remove impedance that the other just added, causing fluctuating power flows.</p><p>\u201cThese technologies operate very quickly, but the computers in the control room are still very reliant on people making decisions,\u201d says Ireland. \u201cSo there are time scales that we have to take into consideration when planning and operating the network.\u201d</p><p>This kind of conservative dispatching leaves value on the table. For example, the dynamic line rating models can spit out new line ratings every 15 minutes, but grid operators get updates only every 24 hours. Fewer updates means fewer opportunities to tap the system\u2019s ability to boost capacity. Similarly, for SmartValves, NESO activates installations at only one substation at a time. And control-room operators turn them on manually, even though the devices could automatically respond to faults within milliseconds.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers in harnesses and hard hats climbing and standing high up on a transmission tower in the countryside.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9e46e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-in-harnesses-and-hard-hats-climbing-and-standing-high-up-on-a-transmission-tower-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286819&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">National Grid is upgrading transmission lines dating as far back as the 1960s.

For example, when Penwortham is adding impedance to push megawatts off the 275-kV lines, a set closer to Scotland could simultaneously pull the power north, nudging the sum over to the B7a\u2019s eastern circuits. Simulations by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hiorns-6a92b158/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Hiorns</a>, a former National Grid planning director who consults for Smart Wires, suggest that this kind of cooperative action should increase the B7a circuits\u2019 usable capacity by another 250 to 300 MW. \u201cYou double the effectiveness by using them as pairs,\u201d he says.</p><p>Operating multiple flow controllers may become necessary for unlocking the next boundary en route to London, south of the B7a, called Boundary B8. As dynamic line rating, beefier conductors, and SmartValves send more power across the B7a, lines traversing B8 are reaching their limits. Eventually, every boundary along the route will have to be upgraded.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at its U.S. headquarters, Smart Wires is developing other applications for its SSSCs, such as filtering out power oscillations that can destabilize grids and reduce allowable transfers. That capability could be unlocked remotely with firmware.</p><p>The company is also working on a test program that could turn on pairs of SmartValve installations during slack moments when there isn\u2019t much going on in the control rooms. That would give National Grid and NESO operators an opportunity to observe the impacts, and to get more comfortable with the technology.</p><p>National Grid and Smart Wires are also hard at work developing industry-first optimization software for coordinating flow-control devices. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to extend the technology from how we\u2019re using it today,\u201d says Ireland at National Grid. \u201cThat\u2019s the exciting bit.\u201d</p><p>NESO\u2019s Julian Leslie shares that excitement and says he expects SmartValves to begin working together to ease power through the grid\u2014once the operators have the modeling right and get a little more comfortable with the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a great innovation that has the potential to be really transformational,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re just not quite there yet.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Decades of engineering assumptions, predictable inertia, dispatchable baseload generation, and slow, well-characterized system dynamics, are now eroding as wind and solar become dominant sources of electricity. Grid operators face increasingly steep ramp events, larger frequency excursions, faster transients, and prolonged periods where fossil generation is minimal or absent.</p><p>In this environment, battery energy storage systems (BESS) have emerged as essential tools for maintaining stability. They can respond in milliseconds, deliver precise power control, and operate flexibly across a range of services. But unlike conventional generation, batteries are sensitive to operational history, thermal environment, state of charge window, system architecture, and degradation mechanisms. Their long-term behavior cannot be described by a single model or simple efficiency curve, it is the product of complex electrochemical, thermal, and control interactions.</p><p>Most laboratory tests and simulations attempt to capture these effects, but they rarely reproduce the operational irregularities of the grid. Batteries in real markets are exposed to rapid fluctuations in power demand, partial state of charge cycling, fast recovery intervals, high-rate events, and unpredictable disturbances.

Professor Gladwin led the engineering, design, installation, and commissioning of the system, establishing one of the country\u2019s first independent megawatt scale storage platforms.</p><p>The project provided deep insight into how high-power battery chemistries behave under grid stressors. Researchers observed sub-second response times and measured the system\u2019s capability to deliver synthetic inertia-like behavior. As Gladwin reflects, \u201cthat project showed us just how fast and capable storage could be when properly integrated into the grid.\u201d</p><p>But the demonstrator\u2019s long-term value has been its continued operation. Over nearly a decade of research, it has served as a platform for:</p><ul><li>Hybridization studies, including battery-flywheel control architectures</li><li>Response time optimization for new grid services</li><li>Operator training and market integration, exposing control rooms and traders to a live asset</li><li>Algorithm development, including dispatch controllers, forecasting tools, and prognostic and health management systems</li><li>Comparative benchmarking, such as evaluation of different lithium-ion chemistries, lead-acid systems, and second-life batteries</li></ul><p>A recurring finding is that behavior observed on the live grid often differs significantly from what laboratory tests predict. Subtle electrical, thermal, and balance-of-plant interactions that barely register in controlled experiments can become important at megawatt-scale, especially when systems are exposed to rapid cycling, fluctuating set-points, or tightly coupled control actions. Variations in efficiency, cooling system response, and auxiliary power demand can also amplify these effects under real operating stress. As Professor Gladwin notes, \u201cphenomena that never appear in a lab can dominate behavior at megawatt scale.\u201d</p><p>These real-world insights feed directly into improved system design. By understanding how efficiency losses, thermal behavior, auxiliary systems, and control interactions emerge at scale, researchers can refine both the assumptions and architecture of future deployments. This closes the loop between application and design, ensuring that new storage systems can be engineered for the operational conditions they will genuinely encounter rather than idealized laboratory expectations.</p><h2>Ensuring longevity with advanced diagnostics</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Battery testing unit with connected cables and a metal duct.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"260ac\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/battery-testing-unit-with-connected-cables-and-a-metal-duct.jpg?id=62304950&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sheffield\u2019s Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA) enables researchers to test storage technologies not just in simulation or controlled cycling rigs, but under full-scale, live grid conditions.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The University of Sheffield</small></p>Ensuring the long-term reliability of storage requires understanding how systems age under the conditions they actually face. Sheffield\u2019s research combines high-resolution laboratory testing with empirical data from full-scale grid-connected assets, building a comprehensive approach to diagnostics and prognostics. In Gladwin\u2019s words, \u201cA model is only as good as the data and conditions that shape it. To predict lifetime with confidence, we need laboratory measurements, full-scale testing, and validation under real-world operating conditions working together.\u201d<p>A major focus is accurate state estimation during highly dynamic operation. Using advanced observers, Kalman filtering, and hybrid physics-ML approaches, the team has developed methods that deliver reliable SOC, SOH and SOP estimates during rapid power swings, irregular cycling, and noisy conditions where traditional methods break down.</p><p>Another key contribution is understanding cell-to-cell divergence in large strings. Sheffield\u2019s data shows how imbalance accelerates near SOC extremes, how thermal gradients drive uneven ageing, and how current distribution causes long-term drift. These insights inform balancing strategies that improve usable capacity and safety.</p><p>Sheffield has also strengthened lifetime and degradation modeling by incorporating real grid behavior directly into the framework. By analyzing actual market signals, frequency deviations, and dispatch patterns, the team uncovers ageing mechanisms that do not appear during controlled laboratory cycling and would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p>These contributions fall into four core areas:</p><h4>State Estimation and Parameter Identification</h4><ul><li>Robust SOC/SOH estimation</li><li>Online parameter identification for equivalent circuit models</li><li>Power capability prediction using transient excitation</li><li>Data selection strategies under noise and variability</li></ul><h4>Degradation and Lifetime Modelling</h4><ul><li>Degradation models built on real frequency and market data</li><li>Analysis of micro cycling and asymmetric duty cycles</li><li>Hybrid physics-ML forecasting models</li></ul><h4>Thermal and Imbalance Behavior</h4><ul><li>Characterizing thermal gradients in containerized systems</li><li>Understanding cell imbalance in large-scale systems</li><li>Mitigation strategies at the cell and module level</li><li>Coupled thermal-electrical behavior under fast cycling</li></ul><h4>Hybrid Systems and Multi-Technology Optimization</h4><ul><li>Battery-flywheel coordination strategies</li><li>Techno-economic modeling for hybrid assets</li><li>Dispatch optimization using evolutionary algorithms</li><li>Control schemes that extend lifetime and enhance service performance</li></ul><p>Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield\u2019s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments.

The team\u2019s techniques in cell characterization, parameter estimation, and in-situ health tracking have helped extend the usable life of MOPO\u2019s battery packs. \u201cBy applying our know-how, we can make these battery-swap packs clean, safe, and significantly more affordable than petrol and diesel generators for the communities that rely on them,\u201d says Professor Gladwin.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield\u2019s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments.

That\u2019s a problem Peng Zou and his team at startup <a href=\"https://www.powerlatticeinc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PowerLattice</a> say they have solved by miniaturizing and repackaging high-voltage regulators.</p><p>The company claims that its new <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chiplet\" target=\"_self\">chiplets</a> deliver up to a 50 percent reduction in power consumption and twice performance per watt by sizing down the voltage conversion process and moving it significantly closer to processors.</p><h2>Shrinking and Moving Power Delivery</h2><p>Traditional systems deliver power to AI chips by converting AC power from the grid into DC power, which then gets transformed again into low-voltage (around one volt) DC, usable by the GPU. With that voltage drop, current must increase to conserve power. </p><p>This exchange happens near the processor, but the current still travels a meaningful distance in its low-voltage state. A high current traveling any distance is bad news, because the system loses power in the form of heat proportional to the current squared. \u201cThe closer you get to the processor, the less distance that the high current has to travel, and thus we can reduce the power loss,\u201d says <a href=\"https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/hanh-phuc-le\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hanh-Phuc Le</a>, who researches power electronics at the University California, San Diego and has no connection to PowerLattice.</p><p>Given the ever-growing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" target=\"_self\">power consumption of AI data centers</a>, \u201cthis has almost become a show-stopping issue today,\u201d PowerLattice\u2019s Zou says.</p><p>Zou thinks he and his colleagues have found a way to avoid this huge loss of power. Instead of dropping the voltage a few centimeters away from the processor, they figured out how to do it millimeters away, within the processor\u2019s package. PowerLattice designed tiny power delivery chiplets\u2014shrinking inductors, voltage control circuits, and software-programmable logic into an IC about twice the size of a pencil eraser. The chiplets sit under the processor\u2019s package substrate, to which they\u2019re connected.</p><p>One challenge the minds at PowerLattice faced was how to make inductors smaller without altering their capabilities. Inductors temporarily store energy and then release it smoothly, helping regulators maintain steady outputs. Their physical size directly influences how much energy they can manage, so shrinking them weakens their effect.</p><p>The startup countered this issue by building their inductors from a specialized magnetic alloy that \u201cenables us to run the inductor very efficiently at high frequency,\u201d Zou says. \u201cWe can operate at a hundred times higher frequency than the traditional solution.\u201d At higher operating frequencies, circuits can be designed to use an inductor with a much lower inductance, meaning the component itself can be made with less physical material. The alloy is unique because it maintains better magnetic properties than comparable materials at these high frequencies.</p><p>The resulting chiplets are less than 1/20th the area of today\u2019s voltage regulators, Zou says. And each is only 100 micrometers thick, around the thickness of a strand of hair. Being so tiny allows the chiplets to fit as close as possible to the processor, and the space savings provide valuable real estate to other components.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"3D rendering of PowerLattice's chiplets on the underside of a processor package.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e0195\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-powerlattice-s-chiplets-on-the-underside-of-a-processor-package.jpg?id=62303434&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">PowerLattice\u2019s chiplets would sit on the underside of a GPU\u2019s package to provide power from below.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">PowerLattice</small></p><p>Even at their small size, the proprietary tech is \u201chighly configurable and scalable,\u201d Zou says. Customers can use multiple chiplets for a more comprehensive fix or fewer if their architecture doesn\u2019t require it. \u201cIt\u2019s one key differentiator\u201d of PowerLattice\u2019s solution to the voltage regulation problem, according to Zou.</p><p>Employing the chiplets can reduce 50 percent of power needs for an operator, effectively doubling performance, the company claims. But this number seems ambitious to Le. He says that 50 percent power savings \u201ccould be achievable, but that means PowerLattice has to have direct control of the load, which includes the processor as well.\u201d The only way he sees it as realistic is if the company has the ability to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-circuit-to-boost-battery-life\" target=\"_self\">manage power supply in real time </a>depending on a processor\u2019s workload\u2014a technique called <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/dynamic-voltage-and-frequency-scaling\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic voltage and frequency scaling</a>\u2014which PowerLattice does not.</p><h2>Facing Competition</h2><p>Right now, PowerLattice is in the midst of reliability and validation testing before it releases its first product to customers, in about two years. But bringing the chiplets to market won\u2019t be straightforward because PowerLattice has some big-name competition. Intel, for example, is developing a <a href=\"https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/ipla/software-development-platforms/servers/platforms/intel-pentium-silver-and-intel-celeron-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/fully-integrated-voltage-regulator-fivr/\" target=\"_blank\">Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator</a>, a device partially devoted to solving the same problem. </p><p>Zou doesn\u2019t consider Intel competition because, in addition to the products differing in their approaches to the power delivery problem, he does not believe Intel will be providing its technology to its competitors. \u201cFrom a market position perspective, we are quite a bit different,\u201d Zou says.</p><p>A decade ago, PowerLattice wouldn\u2019t have room to succeed, Le says, because companies that sold processors only ensured reliability for their chips if customers purchased their power supplies as well. \u201cQualcomm, for example, can sell their processor chip and the vast majority of their customers also have to buy their proprietary Qualcomm power supply management chip because otherwise they would say, \u2018We don\u2019t guarantee the reliable operation of the whole system.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Now, though, there may be hope. \u201cThere\u2019s a trend of what we call chiplet implementation, so it is a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-view-of-the-chiplet-revolution\" target=\"_self\">heterogeneous integration</a>,\u201d Le says. Customers are mixing and matching components from different companies to achieve better system optimization, he says. </p><p>And while notable providers like Intel and Qualcomm may continue to have the upper hand with notable customers, smaller companies\u2014mostly startups\u2014building processors and AI infrastructures will also be power hungry. These groups will need to look for a power supply source, and that\u2019s where PowerLattice and similar companies could come in, Le says. \u201cThat\u2019s how the market is. We have a startup working with a startup doing something that actually rivals, and even competes with, some large companies.\u201d</p>"

We know this because Morse\u2019s associate Alfred Vail kept a \u201cJournal of the Magnetic Telegraph between Washington and Baltimore\u201d (now part of the <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214\" target=\"_blank\">Vail Telegraph Collection</a> at the Smithsonian) in which he meticulously recorded messages sent over the wire for posterity.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A hand-written note dated Nov 26 records chess moves in a game between Washington, D.C, and Baltimore \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d7781\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-hand-written-note-dated-nov-26-records-chess-moves-in-a-game-between-washington-d-c-and-baltimore.jpg?id=62293859&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Notes from a 26 November 1844 chess game record players\u2019 moves, as well as other snippets of information, such as \u201cI sent tea for Mr. Vail by 5 o\u2019clock train.\u201d</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Institution Archives</a></small></p><p>On 15 November 1844, Vail in Washington instructed Henry J. Rogers in Baltimore to \u201cget a checkerboard and let us play a game tomorrow morning.\u201d Vail promised to send instructions by regular mail on the five o\u2019clock train. At first confused, Rogers came up with the idea of using numbered squares to communicate locations on the board. Later that day, Rogers announced that John Wills, a journalist with the <em><em>Baltimore Patriot</em></em>, would play in his place.</p><p>The next morning, before the checkers game began, Vail recorded a telegraphic exchange between himself and Rogers, in which Vail suggests the game is for private enjoyment, and he would prefer that Wills\u2014a reporter\u2014not write about it:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Do you think the game any advantage R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>What game V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Checkers R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Amusement V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Don\u2019t you think people will make remarks R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Not if it is done by ourselves V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>yes have you any objections to Wills R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>none if he does not publish it V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>yes R</em></p><p>Wills was thoroughly impressed with the technology, calling it \u201canother wonder of the age,\u201d according to Rogers. And so the telegraphers agreed that he could publish an account of the game, which perhaps was Vail\u2019s hope all along. The story was still being prepared for publication on 18 November when Vail tapped, \u201cThe Washington Chess Club challenge Baltimore to a game.\u201d</p><h2>How about a Nice Game of Chess?</h2><p>Vail\u2019s 1845 book about the telegraph includes <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#CHESS\" target=\"_blank\">a brief report</a> on chess.

While many of the rules and conventions of chess would be familiar to modern chess players, the games were unusual in other ways. At the time, the standard way of describing chess moves was descriptive notation, says <a href=\"https://new.uschess.org/author/john-mccrary\" target=\"_blank\">John McCrary</a>, a former president of the <a href=\"https://new.uschess.org/\" target=\"_blank\">United States Chess Federation</a> who maintains a collection of some 100 chess books from <a href=\"https://chesscollectorsinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/rare-chess-book-collecting.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">before 1900</a>. For instance, \u201cpawn to queen\u2019s bishop\u2019s four\u201d described moving a pawn in front of the bishop on the queen\u2019s side of the board to the fourth row from the bottom.<p>Before the electrical telegraph, such descriptions would have been used in correspondence chess, played by mail. And <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/TheOxfordCompanionToChessFirstEditionByDavidHooperKennethWhyld/page/n355/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The Oxford Companion to Chess</em></em></a> (1984) describes a proposed 1823 match between France and England that intended to use semaphore telegraph, although the notation used was either never planned or has been lost to time.</p><p>But Vail and Rogers used a system that assigned a unique number to each of the 64 squares. So \u201cpawn to queen\u2019s bishop\u2019s four\u201d would have been rendered as \u201c11 to 27.\u201d Though the game itself can be remarkably complex, that system allowed individual moves to be communicated simply. \u201cThe exchange of information in chess is relatively low,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-kazdan-ba92968/\" target=\"_blank\">David Kazdan</a>, an engineer at <a href=\"https://case.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Case Western Reserve University</a> who has recently overseen a <a href=\"https://www.arrl.org/news/view/using-amateur-radio-to-play-chess\" target=\"_blank\">renewed collaboration</a> between the school\u2019s radio and chess clubs. \u201cYou don\u2019t need much of a communication channel to play chess.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two hand-drawn grids labeled \\u201ccheckers\\u201d and \\u201ccheckers &amp; chess,\\u201d with numbers in different squares. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2e716\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-hand-drawn-grids-labeled-u201ccheckers-u201d-and-u201ccheckers-chess-u201d-with-numbers-in-different-squares.jpg?id=62293861&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">To represent the positions on their telegraph chess board, Alfred Vail and Henry Rogers assigned a unique number to each of the 64 squares.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Institution Archives</a></small></p><p>Vail\u2019s book logs the moves for two of the chess games, and both accounts include an illegal move\u2014probably errors that were introduced later.

The sides also agreed to a limit of 10 minutes per move, even though time controls weren\u2019t common in chess, and the chess clock had not yet been invented. And while Vail wanted \u201cfirst rate players,\u201d McCrary calls the overall play weak, with a poor understanding of the long-term planning needed to coordinate all of the pieces. Both teams also made tactical errors. For example, in the second game, Washington overlooked that one of their pawns was overworked defending two other pieces simultaneously, watched as Baltimore captured one of the pieces, and elected not to retaliate in order to continue defending a more valuable knight. \u201cEven with changing conventions of that time, what was there in the description was atypical,\u201d says McCrary.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chess-computer-1920\" target=\"_self\">This 1920 Chess Automaton Was Wired to Win</a></p><p>The teams took a break during the first game and then reconvened on 28 November.

By tapping on a key, telegraph operators would interrupt a battery-powered current that ran the length of the telegraph wire. At the other end, an electromagnet moved a stylus, pen, or pencil, to mark a piece of paper with the corresponding dots and dashes, which an operator would then read. (The sounder, which turned the signals into audible sounds, hadn\u2019t yet been invented.)</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">Related: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph\" target=\"_self\">Morse Code\u2019s Vanquished Competitor: The Dial Telegraph</a></p><p>During the chess games, the telegraph operators occasionally asked each other how many people were in the room. At times, a dozen kibitzers looked on. At others, only the rotating cast of chess players and telegraph operators was present.</p><h2>Telegraph Chess Moves On</h2><p>The Baltimore\u2013Washington telegraph line was an immediate hit with a general public that embraced popular science through lectures and popular books and magazines. <em><em>Scientific American</em></em> was founded in 1845, for example. But people were more curious to see the telegraph at work than they were to use its services, even though the line operated <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-week-of-the-telegraph/\" target=\"_blank\">free of charge</a> for the first year. \u201cOperators tended to show its capabilities rather than handling actual message traffic,\u201d says Hochfelder.</p><p>The lack of activity is sometimes evident in the telegraph journal. Many of the messages are purely functional (\u201cI am ready,\u201d \u201cstop 30 minutes\u201d); simple greetings; notifications of letters sent and received; or requests for daily newspapers. The Baltimore end of the telegraph was in the Mt. Clare station of the <a href=\"https://preservationmaryland.org/this-day-in-history-chartering-of-the-bo-railroad/\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;O railroad</a>, and the telegraph line ran alongside the tracks. Mail delivered by train took half a day door to door, says Hochfelder, and the telegraph offered little practical advantage.</p><p>On 5 December 1844, Rogers wrote to Vail:</p><p>\u201cI hear from several sources that we are making rather an unfavorable impression with the religious part of the community, and I am under the impression if we continue after the present party is through that we will be injured more than any benefit might or can be derived from it.\u201d</p><p>The exact nature of the religious community\u2019s complaint with telegraph chess is unclear.</p><p>Although Morse wrote to Vail on the day of the first chess game that he \u201cwas much pleased with your game of drafts,\u201d he came to feel that chess was too <a href=\"https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">frivolous</a> for the telegraph, as noted by the chess writer Tim Harding in his <a href=\"https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/correspondence-chess-in-britain-and-ireland-1824-1987/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Correspondence Chess in Britain and Ireland, 1824\u20131987</em></em></a> (McFarland, 2011)<em><em>.</em></em> Whatever the reasons, it appears that after 17 December 1844, no more chess was played on the line. And in the end, Congress didn\u2019t fund a telegraphic connection to New York, nor did it acquire perpetual rights to the telegraph, in part because Morse\u2019s business partner had other designs, says Hochfelder. The Baltimore\u2013Washington line operated under the auspices of the <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/telegraph.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Postal Service</a> from 1845 to 1847, when funding ended.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two black and white photos.

Over the next few years, companies built local lines and networks to connect cities across the country. Most notably, Ezra Cornell\u2019s Western Union completed a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-transcontinental-telegraph.htm\" target=\"_blank\">transcontinental telegraph in 1861</a>, and eventually became a monopoly in the United States. Ordinary people rarely used the telegraph, says Hochfelder, but it transformed industries such as finance and journalism.</p><p>Meanwhile, telegraph chess was taken up elsewhere. In 1845, for example, a match between London and Gosport, England, involved inventor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph\" target=\"_self\">Charles Wheatstone</a> and chess master Howard Staunton. But it would take another few decades for telechess to become more widespread, with prominent club matches <a href=\"https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">played over telegraph</a> from the 1890s into the 1920s.</p><p>High-level chess competitions tend to be held in person, but games have been played remotely from time to time. For example, in 1965, U.S. grandmaster Bobby Fischer relayed his moves <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0UJ52Gw5W4\" target=\"_blank\">by teletype</a> over telephone lines from New York City to Havana, after the U.S. State Department prevented his attending a tournament there.

Dexcom claimed the G7 to be the <a href=\"https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2022/Dexcom-G7-Receives-FDA-Clearance-The-Most-Accurate-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring-System-Cleared-in-the-U.S/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cmost accurate sensor\u201d</a> available to the thousands of people with Type 1 diabetes who use continuous glucose monitors to help manage their blood sugars. But Heller found that its real-world performance wasn\u2019t up to par. In a September 2023 post on his Substack, which is dedicated to covering Type 1 diabetes research and management, he <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/danheller/p/the-dexcom-g7-vs-g6-which-is-better?r=1q2796&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about the experience</a> and predicted an increase in adverse events with the G7, drawing on his past experience leading tech and biotech companies. <strong></strong></p><p>In the two years since Heller\u2019s experiment, many other users have reported issues with the device. Some complaints regard failed connection and deployment issues, which Dexcom claims to have <a href=\"https://www.medtechdive.com/news/dexcom-execs-fixed-g7-quality-problems/804383/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">now addressed</a>. More concerning are reports of erratic, inaccurate readings. A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1539517486772872\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public Facebook group</a> dedicated to sharing negative experiences with the G7 has grown to thousands of users, and several class action <a href=\"https://rosenlegal.com/case/dexcom-inc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuits</a> have been filed against the company, alleging <a href=\"https://wilshirelawfirm.com/dexcom-class-action-lawsuit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">false advertising</a> and <a href=\"https://cowperlaw.com/cowper-law-llp-dicello-levitt-file-class-action-against-dexcom-over-misleading-claims-about-g7-cgm/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">misleading claims</a> about device accuracy. </p><p>Yet, based on a standard metric in the industry, the G7 is one of the most accurate glucose sensors available. \u201cAccuracy in the performance of our device is our number one priority. We understand this is a lifesaving device for people with Type 1 diabetes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-c-simpson-533a083/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Simpson</a>, Dexcom\u2019s senior vice president of innovation and sensor technology, told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>. Simpson acknowledged some variability in individual sensors, but stood by the accuracy of the devices.</p><p>So why have users faced issues? In part, metrics used in marketing can be misleading compared to real world performance. Differences in study design, combined with complex biological realities, mean that the accuracy of these biosensors can\u2019t be boiled down to one number\u2014and users are learning this the hard way. </p><h2>Dexcom\u2019s Glucose Monitors</h2><p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) typically consist of a small filament inserted under the skin, a transmitter, and a receiver. The filament is coated with an enzyme that generates an electrical signal when it reacts with glucose in the fluid surrounding the body\u2019s cells. That signal is then converted to a digital signal and processed to generate glucose readings every few minutes. Each sensor lasts a week or two before needing to be replaced. <strong></strong></p><p>The technology has come a long way in recent years. In the 2010s, these devices required blood glucose calibrations twice a day and still weren\u2019t reliable enough to dose insulin based on the readings. Now, some insulin pumps use the near-real-time data to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-pancreas-could-conquer-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">automatically make adjustments</a>. With those improvements has come greater trust in the data users receive\u2014and higher standards. A faulty reading could result in a dangerous dose of insulin. </p><p>The G7 introduced several changes to Dexcom\u2019s earlier designs, including a much smaller footprint, and updated the algorithm used to translate sensor signals into glucose readings for better accuracy, Simpson says. \u201cFrom a performance perspective, we did demonstrate in a clinical trial that the G7 is significantly more accurate than the G6,\u201d he says. </p><p>So Heller and others were surprised when the new Dexcom sensor seemed to be performing worse. For some batches of sensors, it\u2019s possible that the issue was in part due to an unvalidated change in a component used in a resistive layer of the sensors. The new component showed worse performance, according to a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dexcom-inc-700835-03042025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warning letter</a> issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2025, following an audit of two U.S. manufacturing sites. The material has since been removed from all G7 sensors, Simpson says, and the company is continuing to work with the FDA to address concerns. (\u201cThe warning letter does not restrict Dexcom\u2019s ability to produce, market, manufacture or distribute products, require recall of any products, nor restrict our ability to seek clearance of new products,\u201d Dexcom added in a statement.)</p><p>\u201c<span>There is a distribution of accuracies that have to do with people\u2019s physiology and also the devices themselves. Even in our clinical studies, we saw some that were really precise and some that had a little bit of inaccuracy to them,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cBut in general, our sensor is very accurate.\u201d</span></p><p><span>In late November Abbott\u2014one of Dexcom\u2019s main competitors\u2014<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts/early-alert-glucose-monitor-sensor-issue-abbott-diabetes-care\" target=\"_blank\">recalled some of its CGMs</a> due to inaccurate low glucose readings. The recall affects approximately 3 million sensors and was caused by an issue with one of Abbott\u2019s production lines. </span></p><p>The discrepancy between reported accuracy and user experience, however, goes beyond any one company\u2019s manufacturing missteps. </p><h2>Does MARD Matter? </h2><p>The accuracy of CGM systems is frequently measured via \u201cmean absolute relative difference,\u201d or MARD, a percentage that compares the sensor readings to laboratory blood glucose measurements. The lower the MARD, the more accurate the sensor. </p><p>This number is often used in advertising and marketing, and it has a historical relevance, says <a href=\"https://de.linkedin.com/in/manueich/de\" target=\"_blank\">Manuel Eichenlaub</a>, a biomedical engineer at the <a href=\"https://www.ifdt-ulm.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Diabetes Technology Ulm</a> in Germany, where he and his colleagues conduct independent CGM performance studies. For years, there was <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2023.0435\" target=\"_blank\">a general belief</a> that a MARD under 10 percent meant a system would be accurate enough to be used for insulin dosing. In 2018, the FDA established a specific set of accuracy <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-862/subpart-B/section-862.1355\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a> beyond MARD for insulin-guiding glucose monitors, including Dexcom\u2019s. But manufacturers design the clinical trials that determine accuracy metrics, and the way studies are designed can make a big difference. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graph comparing readings from two glucose monitors from 12 AM to 2:24 PM.

But glucose levels vary across blood compartments in the body; blood collected from capillaries with a finger prick fluctuates more and can have glucose levels around 5 to 10 percent higher than venous blood. (Dexcom tests against a gold-standard venous blood analyzer. When users see inaccuracies against home meters that use capillary blood, it could in part be a reflection of the meter\u2019s own inaccuracy, Simpson says, though he acknowledges real inaccuracies in CGMs as well.)</p><p>Additionally, the distribution of sampling isn\u2019t standardized. CGMs are known to be less accurate at the beginning and end of use, or when glucose levels are out of range or changing quickly. That means measured accuracy could be skewed by taking fewer samples right after a meal or late in the CGM\u2019s lifetime. </p><p>According to Simpson, Dexcom\u2019s trial protocol meets the FDA\u2019s expectation and tests the devices in different blood sugar ranges across the life of the sensor. \u201cWithin these clinical trials, we do stress the sensors to try and simulate those real world conditions,\u201d he says. </p><p>Dexcom and other companies advertise a MARD around 8 percent. But some independent studies are more demanding and find higher numbers; a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19322968251315459\" target=\"_blank\">head-to-head study of three popular CGMs</a> that Eichenlaub led found MARD values closer to 10 percent or higher.</p><p><span>Eichenlaub and other CGM experts believe that more standardization of testing and an extension of the FDA requirements are necessary, so they <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898125006072\" target=\"_blank\">recently proposed comprehensive guidelines</a> on CGM performance testing. </span><span>In the United States and Europe</span><span>, a few manufacturers currently dominate the market. But</span><span> newer players are entering the growing market and, especially in Europe,</span><span> may not meet the same standards as legacy manufacturers, he says</span><span>. \u201cHaving a standardized way of evaluating the performance of those systems is very important.\u201d</span></p><p>For users like Heller though, better accuracy only matters if it yields better diabetes management. \u201cI don\u2019t care about MARD. I want data that is reliably <em><em>actionable</em></em>,\u201d Heller says. He encourages engineers working on these devices to think like the patient. \u201cAt some point, there\u2019s quantitative data, but you need qualitative data.\u201d </p>"

An expert in AI and machine learning, the IEEE senior member worked on Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bing</a> search engine before moving to Amazon. He also developed several features for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Teams</a>, the company\u2019s direct messaging platform.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working in AI for more than 20 years now,\u201d he says. \u201dSeeing how much we can do with technology still amazes me.\u201d</p><p>He shares his expertise and passion for the technology as an active member and volunteer at the <a href=\"https://ieee-seattle.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Seattle Section</a>. He organizes and hosts career development workshops that teach people to create an AI agent, which can perform tasks autonomously with minimal human oversight.</p><h2>An AI career inspired by a computer</h2><p>Agrawal was born and raised in Chirgaon, a remote village in Uttar Pradesh, India. When he was growing up, no one in Chirgaon had a computer. His family owned a pharmacy, which Agrawal was expected to join after he graduated from high school. Instead, his uncle and older brother encouraged him to attend college and find his own passion.</p><p>He enjoyed mathematics and physics, and he decided to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in statistics at the <a href=\"https://www.allduniv.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Allahabad</a>. After graduating in 1996, he pursued a master\u2019s degree<strong> </strong>in statistics, statistical quality control, and operations research<strong> </strong>at the <a href=\"https://www.isical.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Statistical Institute</a> in Kolkata.</p><p>While at the ISI, he saw a computer for the first time in the laboratory of <a href=\"https://www.isical.ac.in/~nikhil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nikhil R. Pal</a>, an electronics and communication sciences professor. Pal worked on identifying abnormal clumps of cells in mammogram images using the<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/413225/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> fuzzy c-means model</a>, a data-clustering technique employing a machine learning algorithm.</p><p>Agrawal earned his master\u2019s degree in 1998. He was so inspired by Pal\u2019s work, he says, that he stayed on at the university to earn a second master\u2019s degree, in computer science.</p><p>After graduating in 2001, he joined <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Novell</a> as a senior software engineer working out of its Bengaluru office in India. He helped develop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFolder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">iFolder</a>, a storage platform that allows users across different computers to back up, access, and manage their files.</p><p>After four years, Agrawal left Novell to join Microsoft as a software design engineer, working at the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/hyderabad-campus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hyderabad campus</a> in India. He was part of a team developing a system to upgrade Microsoft\u2019s software from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">XP</a> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vista</a>.</p><p>Two years later, he was transferred to the group developing Bing, a replacement for Microsoft\u2019s Live Search, which had been launched in 2006.</p><h2>Improving Microsoft\u2019s search engine</h2><p>Live Search had a traffic rate of less than 2 percent and struggled to keep up with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>\u2019s faster-paced, more user-friendly system, Agrawal says. He was tasked with improving search results but, Agrawal says, he and his team didn\u2019t have enough user search data to train their machine learning model.</p><p>Data for location-specific queries, such as nearby coffee shops or restaurants, was especially important, he says.</p><p>To overcome those challenges, the team used deterministic algorithms to create a more structured search. Such algorithms give the same answers for any query that uses the same specific terms. The process gets results by taking keywords\u2014such as locations, dates, and prices\u2014and finding them on webpages. To help the search engine understand what users need, Agrawal developed a query clarifier that asked them to refine their search. The machine learning tool then ranked the results from most to least relevant.</p><p>To test new features before they were launched, Agrawal and his team built an online A/B experimentation platform. Controlled tests were completed on different versions of the products, and the platform ran performance and user engagement metrics, then it produced a scorecard to show changes for updated features.</p><p>Bing launched in 2009 and is now the world\u2019s second-largest search engine, according to<a href=\"https://blackraven.digital/the-rise-of-bing-and-how-it-differs-from-google/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Black Raven</a>.</p><p>Throughout his 10 years of working on the system, Agrawal upgraded it. He also worked with the advertising department to improve Microsoft\u2019s services on Bing. Ads relevant to a person\u2019s search are listed among the search results.</p><p>\u201cThe work seems easy,\u201d Agrawal says, \u201cbut behind every search engine are hundreds of engineers powering ads, query formulations, rankings, relevance, and location detection.\u201d</p><h2>Testing products before launch </h2><p>Agrawal was promoted to software development manager in 2010. Five years later he was transferred to Microsoft\u2019s Seattle offices. At the time, the company was deploying new features for existing platforms without first testing them to ensure effectiveness. Instead, they measured their performance after release, Agrawal says, and that was wreaking havoc.</p><p>He proposed using his online A/B experimentation platform on all Microsoft products, not just Bing. His supervisor approved the idea. In six months Agrawal and his team modified the tool for company-wide use. Thanks to the platform, he says, Microsoft was able to smoothly deploy up-to-date products to users.</p><p>After another two years, he was promoted to principal engineering manager of Microsoft Teams, which was facing issues with user experience, he says.</p><p>\u201cMany employees received between 50 and 100 messages a day\u2014which became overwhelming for them,\u201d Agrawal says. To lessen the stress, he led a team that developed the system\u2019s first machine learning feature: Trending. It prioritized the five most important messages users should focus on. Agrawal also led the launch of incorporating emoji reactions, screen sharing, and video calls for Teams.</p><p>In 2020 he was ready for new experiences, he says, and he left Microsoft to join Amazon as an engineering leader.</p><h2>Improved Amazon shopping</h2><p>Agrawal led an Amazon team that manually collected information about products from the company\u2019s retail catalog to create a glossary. The data, which included product dimensions, color, and manufacturer, was used to standardize the language found in product descriptions to keep listings more consistent.</p><p>That is especially important when it comes to third-party sellers, he notes. Sellers listing a product had been entering as much or as little information as they wanted. Agrawal built a system that automatically suggests language from the glossary as the seller types.</p><p>He also developed an AI algorithm that utilizes the glossary\u2019s terminology to refine search results based on what a user types into the search bar. When a shopper types \u201cred mixer,\u201d for example, the algorithm lists products under the search bar that match the description. The shopper can then click on a product from the list.</p><p>In 2023 the retailer\u2019s catalog became too large for Agrawal and his team to collect information manually, so they built an AI tool to do it for them. It became the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Catalog AI system.</p><p>After gathering information about products from around the Web, Catalog AI uses large language models to update Amazon listings with missing information, correct errors, and rewrite titles and product specifications to make them clearer for the customer, Agrawal says.</p><p>The company expects the AI tool to increase sales this year by US $7.5 billion, according to a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/amazons-ai-wants-own-online-shopping-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News report</a> in July.</p><h2>Finding purpose at IEEE</h2><p>Since Agrawal joined IEEE last December, he has been elevated to senior member and has become an active volunteer.</p><p>\u201cBeing part of IEEE has opened doors for collaboration, mentorship, and professional growth,\u201d he says. \u201cIEEE has strengthened both my technical knowledge and my leadership skills, helping me progress in my career.\u201d</p><p>Agrawal is the social media chair of the IEEE Seattle Section. He is also vice chair of the <a href=\"https://cis.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computational Intelligence Society</a>.</p><p>He was a workshop cochair for the <a href=\"https://attend.ieee.org/neweraai25/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE New Era AI World Leaders Summit</a>, which was held from 5 to 7 December in Seattle. The event brought together government and industry leaders, as well as researchers and innovators working on AI, intelligent devices, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-weapons\" target=\"_self\">unmanned aerial vehicles</a>, and similar technologies. They explored how new tools could be used in cybersecurity, the medical field, and national disaster rescue missions.</p><p>Agrawal says he stays up to date on cutting-edge technologies by peer-reviewing 15 IEEE journals.</p><p>\u201cThe organization plays a very important role in bringing authenticity to anything that it does,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a journal article has the IEEE logo, you can believe that it was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-research-integrity-process\" target=\"_self\">thoroughly and diligently reviewed</a>.\u201d</p>"

Her early life unfolded in a world defined by scarcity\u2014rationed food, intermittent electricity, and a limited ability to move up or out. But she recalls that, amid the stifling insufficiencies, she was surrounded by an irrepressible warmth and intellectual curiosity\u2014even when she was making locomotive screws in a state-run factory as part of her school\u2019s curriculum.</p><p>\u201cLife was hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we had great teachers and strong communities. As a child, you adapt to whatever is around you.\u201d</p><p>Her father,<a href=\"https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/teodor-rus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Teodor</a>, was a computer scientist and professor, and her mother, Elena, was a physicist.</p><p>In 1982, when she was 19, Rus\u2019s father emigrated to the United States to join the faculty at the<a href=\"https://uiowa.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Iowa</a>, in Iowa City. It was an act of courage and conviction. Within a year, Daniela and her mother joined him there.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted the freedom to think, to publish, to explore ideas,\u201d Rus says. \u201cAnd I reaped the benefits of being free from the limitations of our homeland.\u201d</p><p>America\u2019s open horizons were intoxicating, she says.</p><h2>A lecture that changed everything</h2><p>Rus decided to pursue a degree at her father\u2019s university, where her life changed direction, she says. One afternoon, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hopcroft_1053917.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John Hopcroft</a>\u2014a<a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Turing Award</a>\u2013winning <a href=\"https://www.cornell.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell</a> computer scientist renowned for his work on algorithms and data structures\u2014gave a talk on campus. His message was simple but electrifying, Rus says: Classical computer science had been solved. The next frontier, Hopcroft declared, was computations that interact with the messy physical world.</p><p>For Rus, the idea was a revelation.</p><p>\u201cIt was as if a door had opened,\u201d she says. \u201cI realized the future of computing wasn\u2019t just about logic and code; it was about how machines can perceive, move, and help us in the real world.\u201d</p><p>After the lecture, she introduced herself to Hopcroft and told him she wanted to learn from him. Not long after earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and mathematics in 1985, she applied to get a master\u2019s degree at Cornell, where Hopcroft became her graduate advisor. Rus developed algorithms there for dexterous <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/minimally-actuated-robot-arm-has-lots-of-joints-just-one-clever-motor\" target=\"_self\">robotic manipulation</a>\u2014teaching machines to grasp and move objects with precision. She earned her master\u2019s in computer science in 1990, then stayed on at Cornell to work toward a doctorate.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI like to think of robotics as a way to give people superpowers. Machines can help us reach farther, think faster, and live fuller lives.\u201d</p><p>In 1993 she earned her Ph.D. in computer science, then took a position as an assistant professor of computer science at <a href=\"https://home.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Dartmouth College</a>, in Hanover, N.H. She founded the college\u2019s robotics laboratory and expanded her work into distributed robotics. She developed teams of small robots that cooperated to perform tasks such as ensuring products in warehouses are correctly gathered to fulfill orders, get packaged safely, and are routed to their respective destinations efficiently.</p><p>Despite a lack of traditional machine shop facilities for fabrication on the Hanover campus, Rus found a way. She pioneered the use of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/printable-robots-mit-project\" target=\"_self\"> 3D printing to rapidly prototype and build robots</a>.</p><p>In 2003 she left Dartmouth to become a professor in the<a href=\"https://www.eecs.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> electrical engineering and computer science</a> department at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>.</p><p>The robotics lab she created at Dartmouth moved with her to MIT and became known as the <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Distributed Robotics Laboratory</a> (DRL). In 2012 she was named director of MIT\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school\u2019s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups including the DRL. She also continues to serve as the DRL\u2019s principal investigator.</p><h2>The science of physical intelligence</h2><p>Rus now leads pioneering research at the intersection of AI and robotics, a field she calls <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">physical intelligence</a>. It\u2019s \u201ca new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time,\u201d <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>.</p><p>Her lab builds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robots-for-hard-problems\" target=\"_self\">soft-body robots inspired by nature</a> that can sense, adapt, and learn. They are AI-driven systems that passively handle tasks\u2014such as self-balancing and complex articulation similar to that done by the human hand\u2014because their shape and materials minimize the need for heavy processing.</p><p>Such machines, she says, someday will be able to navigate different environments, perform useful functions without external control, and even recover from disturbances to their route planning. Researchers also are exploring ways to make them more energy-efficient.</p><p>One prototype developed by Rus\u2019s team is designed to retrieve foreign objects from the body, including batteries swallowed by children. The ingestible robots are artfully folded, similar to origami, so they are small enough to be swallowed. Embedded magnetic materials allow doctors to steer the soft robots and control their shape. Upon arriving in the stomach, a soft bot can be programmed to wrap around a foreign object and guide it safely out of the patient\u2019s body.</p><p>CSAIL researchers also are working on small robots that can carry a medication and release it at a specific area within the digestive tract, bypassing the stomach acid known to diminish some drugs\u2019 efficacy. Ingestible robots also could patch up internal injuries or ulcers. And because they\u2019re made from digestible materials such as sausage casings and biocompatible polymers, the robots can perform their assigned tasks and then get safely absorbed by the body, she says.</p><p>Health care isn\u2019t the only application on the horizon for such AI-driven technologies. Robots with physical intelligence might someday help firefighters locate people trapped in burning buildings, find miners after a cave-in, and provide valuable situational awareness information to emergency response teams in the aftermath of natural disasters, Rus says.</p><p>\u201cWhat excites me is the possibility of giving people new powers,\u201d she says. \u201cMachines that can think and move safely in the physical world will let us extend human reach\u2014at work, at home, in medicine \u2026 everywhere.\u201d</p><p>To make such a vision a reality, she has expanded her technical interests to include several complementary lines of research.</p><p>She\u2019s working on self-reconfiguring and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stochastic-robots-assemble-and-disassemble-themselves\" target=\"_self\">modular robots</a> such as MIT\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/m-blocks-modular-robotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M-Blocks</a> and NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/superbot-modular-multifunctional-reconfigurable-robot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SuperBots</a>, which can attach, detach, and rearrange themselves to form shapes suited for different actions such as slithering, climbing, and crawling.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nyu-tandon-robotics\" target=\"_self\">networked robots</a>\u2014including those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&amp;hvadid=675149237887&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13161685782168516493&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004281&amp;hvtargid=kwd-10573980&amp;ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&amp;hydadcr=28883_14649097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> uses in its warehouses\u2014thousands of machines can operate as a large adaptive system.

But what if a computer could understand you well enough to win every time? A team at Hokkaido University and the <a href=\"https://www.tdk.com/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">TDK Corp.</a> (of cassette-tape fame), both based in Japan, has designed a chip that can do just that.</p><p>Okay, the chip does not read your mind. It uses an acceleration sensor placed on your thumb to measure your motion and eventually earns which motions represent paper, scissors, or rock. The amazing thing is, once it\u2019s trained on your particular gestures, the chip can run the calculation predicting what you\u2019ll do in the time it takes you to say \u201cshoot,\u201d allowing it to defeat you in real time.</p><p>The technique behind this feat is called reservoir computing, which is a machine learning method that uses a complex dynamical system to extract meaningful features from time-series data. The idea of reservoir computing goes as far back as the <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/7/3/311/3172/A-Model-of-Corticostriatal-Plasticity-for-Learning?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1990s</a>. With the growth of artificial intelligence, there has been renewed interest in reservoir computing due to its comparatively low power requirements and its potential for fast training and inference.</p><p>The research team saw power consumption as a target, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomoyuki-sasaki-98284b193/?originalSubdomain=jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tomoyuki Sasaki</a>, section head and senior manager at TDK, who worked on the device. \u201cThe second target is the latency issue. In the case of the edge AI, latency is a huge problem.\u201d</p><p>To minimize the energy and latency of their setup, the team developed a CMOS hardware implementation of an analog reservoir-computing circuit. The team presented their demo at the <a href=\"https://www.ceatec.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies</a> conference in Chiba, Japan, in October and are presenting their paper at the <a href=\"https://rebootingcomp.github.io/icrc2025/#registration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">International Conference on Rebooting Computing</a> in San Diego this week.</p><h2>What is reservoir computing?</h2><p>A reservoir computer is best understood in contrast to traditional <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-deep-learning/neural-network\" target=\"_self\">neural networks</a>, the basic architecture underlying much of AI today.</p><p>A neural network consists of artificial neurons, arranged in layers. Each layer can be thought of as a column of neurons, with each neuron in a column connecting to all the neurons in the next column via weighted artificial synapses. Data enters into the first column and propagates from left to right, layer by layer, until the final column.</p><p>During training, the output of the final layer is compared to the correct answer, and this information is used to adjust the weights in all the synapses, this time working backward, layer by layer, in a process called <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/backpropagation\" target=\"_blank\">backpropagation</a>.</p><p>This setup has two important features. First, the data travels only one way\u2014forward. There are no loops. Second, all of the weights connecting any pair of neurons are adjusted during the training process. This architecture has proven extremely effective and flexible, but it is also costly; adjusting what sometimes ends up being billions of weights takes both time and power.</p><p>Reservoir computing is also built with artificial neurons and synapses, but they are arranged in a fundamentally different way. First, there are no layers\u2014the neurons are connected to other neurons in a complicated, weblike way with plenty of loops. This imbues the network with a type of memory, where a particular input can keep coming back around.</p><p>Second, the connections within the reservoir are fixed. The data enters the reservoir, propagates through its complex structure, and then is connected by a set of final synapses to the output. It\u2019s only this last set of synapses, with their weights, that actually gets adjusted during training. This approach greatly simplifies the training process, and eliminates the need for backpropagation altogether.</p><p>Given that the reservoir is fixed, and the only part that\u2019s trained is a final \u201ctranslation\u201d layer from the reservoir to the desired output, it may seem like a miracle that these networks can be useful at all. And yet, for certain tasks, they have proved to be extremely effective.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re by no means a blanket best model to use in the machine learning toolbox,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/sanjukta-krishnagopal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sanjukta Krishnagopal</a>, assistant professor of computer science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the work. But for predicting the time evolution of things that behave chaotically, such as for example, the weather, they are the right tool for the job. \u201cThis is where reservoir computing shines.\u201d</p><p>The reason is that the reservoir itself is a bit chaotic. \u201cYour reservoir is usually operating at what\u2019s called the edge of chaos, which means it can represent a large number of possible states, very simply, with a very small neural network,\u201d Krishnagopal says. </p><h2>A physical-reservoir computer</h2><p>The artificial synapses inside the reservoir are fixed, and backpropagation does not need to happen. This leaves a lot of freedom in how the reservoir is implemented. To build physical reservoirs, people have used a wide variety of mediums, including <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55172-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">light</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-intelligence-on-a-mems-device-brings-neuromorphic-computing-to-the-edge\" target=\"_self\">MEMS devices</a>, and my personal favorite, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-39432-7_63\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">literal buckets of water</a>.</p><p>However, the team at Hokkaido and TDK wanted to create a CMOS-compatible chip that could be used in edge devices. To implement an artificial neuron, the team designed an analog circuit node. Each node is made up of three components: a nonlinear resistor, a memory element based on MOS capacitors, and a buffer amplifier. Their chip consisted of four cores, each made up of 121 such nodes.</p><p>Wiring up the nodes to connect with each other in the complex recurring patterns required for a reservoir is difficult. To cut down on the complexity, the team decided on a so-called simple cycle reservoir, with all the nodes connected in one big loop. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3722577.3722735\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prior work</a> has suggested that even this relatively simple configuration is capable of modeling a wide range of complicated dynamics.</p><p>Using this design, the team was able to build a chip that consumed only 20 microwatts of power per core, or 80 \u00b5W of power total\u2014significantly less than other CMOS-compatible physical-reservoir computing designs, the authors say.<strong></strong></p><h2>Predicting the future</h2><p>Aside from defeating humans at rock-paper-scissors, the reservoir-computing chip can predict the next step in a time series in many different domains. <span>\u201cI</span><span>f what occurs today is affected by yesterday\u2019s data, or other past data, it can predict the result,</span><span>\u201d </span><span>Sasaki says.</span></p><p>The team demonstrated the chip\u2019s abilities on several tasks, including predicting the behavior of a well-known chaotic system known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map\" target=\"_blank\">logistic map</a>. The team also used the device on the archetypal real-world example of chaos: the weather. For both test cases, the chip was able to predict the next step with remarkable accuracy.</p><p>The precision of the prediction is not the main selling point, however. The extremely low power use and low latency offered by the chip could enable a new set of applications, such as real-time learning on wearables and other edge devices.</p><p>\u201cI think the prediction is actually the same as the present technology,\u201d Sasaki says. \u201cHowever, the power consumption, the operation speed, is maybe 10 times better than the present AI technology. That is a big difference.\u201d</p>"

Virtual power plants, which concatenate small, distributed energy resources, are increasingly being tapped to balance electricity supply and demand. The question is: Can they do their job as well as conventional power plants? </p><p>Grid operators can now find out by running these power plants through a Turing-like test called the Huels. To pass the Huels test, the performance of a virtual power plant must be indistinguishable from that of a conventional power plant. A human grid operator serves as the judge. </p><p>Virtual power plant developer <a href=\"https://www.energyhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EnergyHub</a>, based in Brooklyn, N.Y., developed the test and outlined it in <a href=\"https://www.energyhub.com/building-trustworthy-power-plants-vpp-maturity-model\" target=\"_blank\">a white paper</a> released today. <span>\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is fool the operators into feeling that these virtual power plants can act and feel and smell like conventional power plants,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hines-energy/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Hines</a>, chief scientist at EnergyHub. \u201cThis is a kind of first litmus test.\u201d</span></p><h2>What Are Virtual Power Plants (VPPs)?</h2><p>The virtual-versus-conventional power plant question is a timely one. Virtual power plants, or VPPs, are networks of devices such as rooftop solar panels, home batteries, and smart thermostats that come together through software to collectively supply or conserve electricity<strong>. </strong></p><p>Unlike conventional power generation systems, which might crank up one big gas plant when electricity demand peaks, VPPs tap into small, widely disbursed equipment. For example, a VPP might harness electricity from hundreds of plugged-in electric vehicles or rooftop solar panels. Or it might direct smart thermostats in homes or businesses to turn down heat or cooling systems to reduce demand. </p><p>The technology is emerging at a time when concerns over data centers\u2019 electricity demand is hitting a fever pitch. The consultancy BloombergNEF <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/ai-and-the-power-grid-where-the-rubber-meets-the-road/\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> data-center energy demand in the United States <a href=\"https://heatmap.news/am/data-center-demand\" target=\"_blank\">will reach 106 gigawatts by 2035</a>\u2013a 36 percent jump from what it had projected just seven months ago. </p><p>How utilities and grid operators will meet the growing demand is unclear and faces challenges on many fronts. Turbines for natural gas plants are backordered and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-powered-data-center\" target=\"_blank\">new nuclear reactors</a> are still years away. Wind and solar, while cheap and fast to build, don\u2019t produce the 24/7 electricity that data centers demand, and face an uphill political battle under the Trump administration. </p><p>All of this together has created an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-battery-tech\" target=\"_blank\">opening for VPPs</a>, which could add gigawatts to the grid without significantly jacking up electricity rates. \u201cIt\u2019s a political issue. If you said you\u2019re going to get electricity costs under control, this is literally the only way to do it in 12 months,\u201d says <a href=\"https://x.com/JigarShahDC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jigar Shah</a>, a clean energy investor at <a href=\"https://multiplier.expert/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Multiplier</a> in Washington, D.C., who led the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration. </p><p>VPPs could also reduce utilities\u2019 need to invest in distribution equipment, avoiding supply chain shortages and inflated costs, Shah says. \u201cThere is no other idea that you could possibly deploy in 12 months that would have that big of an impact,\u201d he says. </p><p>According to a 2024 U.S. Department of Energy <a href=\"https://www.smartenergydecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/liftoff_doe_virtualpowerplants2025update.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, VPPs could provide between 80 and 160 gigawatts of capacity across the U.S. by 2030\u2014enough to meet between 10 and 20 percent of peak grid demand. </p><h2>How Can VPPs Gain Grid Operator Trust?</h2><p>But first, VPP developers have to win over grid developers. Benchmarks like the Huels test are crucial to building that trust. \u201cIn order for us to build our reliance on VPPs, they do need to pass the Huels test and operators need to be able to count on\u201d the VPPs delivering power when called upon, said <a href=\"https://rmi.org/people/lauren-shwisberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren Shwisberg</a>, a principal in the nonprofit research group Rocky Mountain Institute who co-authored a recent <a href=\"https://rmi.org/how-virtual-power-plants-can-help-the-united-states-win-the-ai-race/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on VPPs and was not involved in the development of the test. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.huels.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthias Huels</a>, an engineer who spent more than four years at EnergyHub, first came up with the idea for the test in 2024. After workshopping the idea with colleagues and, somewhat ironically, ChatGPT, Huels presented the concept to the company.</p><p>Huels designed the test subjectively. Currently, in its earliest iteration, it appears to follow a guideline akin to the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://texaslawreview.org/8459-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I know it when I see it</a>\u201d test for what distinguishes pornography from erotic art. That is to say: passing the test depends on who\u2019s judging. If a grid operator finds the power from a VPP as dependable as electricity from an actual power plant burning gas to produce electrons, then the VPP has passed. </p><p>There are four levels to the Huels test. To reach level 1, a VPP must be able to shave off demand from the grid by, for example, successfully scheduling smart thermostats to dial down when the grid faces maximum demand. To reach level 2, a VPP must be able to respond to market and grid data and dial down demand when prices hit a certain level or tap into solar panels or batteries when power is needed. Human decision makers are involved at these levels.</p><p>Passing the Huels test comes at level 3. That\u2019s when a VPP can function automatically because it\u2019s proven reliable enough to be indistinguishable from a gas peaker plant\u2013the type of power station that comes online as backup only when the grid is under stress. Passing level 4 involves VPPs acting fully autonomously to adjust output based on a number of actively-changing variables throughout the day. </p><p>\u201cThe imitation game that Alan Turing came up with was: Can a computer fool an interrogator to think it\u2019s actually human even though it\u2019s a computer,\u201d Hines says. \u201cWe propose this idea of a test that would allow us to say: Can we fool a grid operator into thinking that the thing that\u2019s actually solving their problems is this aggregation of many devices instead of a big gas plant?\u201d</p><h2>Can VPPs Mimic Gas Peaker Plants? </h2><p>Peaker plants only generate power about 5 percent of the time over their lifespans. That makes them easier for VPPs to mimic because, like peaker plants, the limited amount of power that can be made available by demand response or harvested from batteries only provides bursts of power that last a few hours at a time.</p><p>Far more difficult is stacking up to a full-scale gas plant, which operates 65 percent of the time or more, or a nuclear plant, which usually operates at least 95 percent of the time. Getting there would involve equipping a VPP network with long-duration storage that could be powered up during the day when solar panels are at peak output and discharged all night long. \u201cYou start talking about VPPs with large amounts of batteries that can run 365 days per year,\u201d Hines says. \u201cThat\u2019s a road we can go down.\u201d</p><p>EnergyHub has been putting its VPP systems through the Huels test. Last year, EnergyHub <a href=\"https://www.energyhub.com/news/dynamic-load-shaping-demand-response\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">successfully ran trials</a> with Arizona Public Service, Duke Energy in North Carolina, and National Grid in Massachusetts. In Arizona, EnergyHub\u2019s software dialed into homes with solar panels and smart thermostats and ran air conditioners to \u201cpre-cool\u201d houses during the day when the sun was generating lots of electricity. This allowed the state\u2019s biggest utility to reduce demand during peak hours when residents would typically return home from work to turn on televisions and crank up their air conditioners.</p><p>\u201cYou have too much power in the middle of the day because of solar, then the early evening comes and you get people ramping up their evening loads right as the solar is ramping down,\u201d Hines says. \u201cYou need something that can feather through that schedule. We created something that can do this.\u201d </p><p>That lands the company somewhere between a 2 and 3 on the Huels testing scale. Passing level 3 \u201cis going to take a few years,\u201d Hines says.</p>"
