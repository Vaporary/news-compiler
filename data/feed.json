Using new micro-data on the U.S. economy in 1860, we document that where free and enslaved workers live and how much they earn correlates strongly\u2014but differently\u2014with geographic proxies for agricultural productivity, disease, and ease of slave escape. To explain these patterns, we build a quantitative spatial model of slavery, where slaveholders coerce enslaved workers into supplying more labor, capture the proceeds of their labor, and assign them to sectors and occupations that maximize owner profits rather than worker welfare. Combining theory and data, we then quantify how dismantling the institution of slavery affected the spatial economy. We find that the economic impacts of emancipation are substantial, generating welfare gains for the enslaved of roughly 1,200%, while reducing welfare of free workers by 0.7% and eliminating slaveholder profit. Aggregate GDP rises by 9.1%, with a contraction in agricultural productivity counteracted by an expansion in manufacturing and services driven by an exodus of formerly enslaved workers out of agriculture and into the U.S. North."

        "summary": "This study uses fiscal gap accounting (FGA) and generational accounting (GA) to compare US and Italian fiscal solvency. FGA and GA incorporate all government outlays and receipts, whether put on or kept off the books. FGA measures, in the form of reduced net outlays, the constant share of each future year\u2019s GDP needed to balance the government\u2019s intertemporal budget. GA calculates the lifetime net tax rate \u2013 lifetime taxes divided by lifetime labor earnings -- facing future generations if current generations pay nothing more, on net, than current policy mandates. Deficit accounting suggests that Italy\u2019s 135 percent debt-to-GDP ratio places it in worse fiscal shape than the US with its 123 percent ratio. But on a fiscal-gap basis, Italy appears in far better shape regardless of the discount rate used. Based on the theoretically appropriate rate \u2013 the average real return to national wealth, the U.S. fiscal gap is 7.4%. Italy\u2019s is 4.0%. These requisite solvency adjustments are far larger if delayed or if the UN\u2019s more pessimistic demographic projections prevail. Neither country can expect future generations, on their own, to cover their government\u2019s red ink. Doing so requires levying lifetime net tax rates, in each country, that exceed 100%."

We examine such tradeoffs in the context of physician training (i.e., \u201cresidency\u201d programs). Using the universe of Medicare inpatient and outpatient records from 2014-2019 and differences-in-differences analyses, we show that hospitals\u2019 productivity and revenues grow by 10-20% after underwriting a procedure-oriented residency\u2013\u2013though heterogeneity exists. The hospitals benefiting from trainee labor conservatively net over $2 million in steady-state, revealing substantive private incentives to finance physician training."

However, knowledge varies widely across educational levels, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. Despite evidence that this knowledge can be improved, no comprehensive metric exists for efficient assessment. We introduce SPEAK (Survey of Parent/Provider Expectations and Knowledge), a computer-adaptive tool grounded in item-response theory that we created, to address this gap by measuring parental and educator knowledge across development domains with precision and speed. This paper details SPEAK's development, including domain construction, cognitive interviewing, expert review, psychometric calibration, and validity evidence. SPEAK offers a flexible, scalable solution for clinical, educational, research, and policy settings. By identifying knowledge gaps, it enables tailored interventions, supports professional development, and informs policy, ultimately improving parent-child interactions and child outcomes. Our tool bridges critical gaps in assessing child development knowledge, advancing research and cross-sector collaboration to promote early childhood development worldwide."

Female physicians reduce their office visits by 85% in the quarter after giving birth, but return nearly to pre-birth levels within two years. These supply disruptions generate persistent effects on child patients: those whose primary care physician gives birth are less likely to see their usual physician for up to two years and receive less preventative care, including a 50% reduction in vaccination claims and a 42% reduction in lead testing. In contrast, we find little impact on adult patients. The lasting effects on children coincide with fewer pediatrician encounters overall, consistent with limited availability of substitute providers and the central role of pediatricians in monitoring children\u2019s preventative care. Our findings demonstrate how shocks to women\u2019s labor supply can generate persistent consumer welfare losses."

We discuss the background fundamentals in place at the outset of the Great Inflation and document the distinct phases of inflation, the unique features of the UK\u2019s experience relative to other advanced economies, and the interplay between fiscal, monetary, and incomes policies. By placing the UK\u2019s inflationary episodes within their institutional and historical context, this paper offers a qualitative perspective that complements the quantitative analysis of the main paper and informs ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of persistent inflation."

        "summary": "Despite a large earnings premium for bachelor\u2019s degree completion in general, graduates from low-income families earn substantially less than graduates from high-income families. While prior research has documented the role of college quality and major choice in explaining these gaps, we examine undermatching on a different margin: the first (post-college) job transition. The transition from college to the labor market can be challenging to navigate, and students with financial, informational, or other disadvantages during the job search may be more likely to \u201cundermatch\u201d to their first job. Using administrative data from a large, urban, public college system, we document large gaps in earnings five years after graduation by SES (proxied by financial aid receipt) that remain unexplained even after controlling for GPA, college, field of study, and other pre-graduation characteristics. We then examine how features of the initial job transition relate to longer-term earnings, and to what extent differences in the first job transition can explain later SES earnings gaps. Our results show that first job transitions are rocky for many graduates, strongly predict earnings at Year 5, and are a substantial mediator of socioeconomic gaps in earnings five years after college graduation\u2014reducing the unexplained gap by almost two-thirds."

This implies that export elasticities with respect to the exchange rate are small, rendering even large depreciations ineffectual in the short term. We incorporate two innovations versus existing work. First, we allow for nonlinearities, permitting large depreciations to disproportionately lift exports. Second, we control for banking crises, which accompany many depreciations. Our baseline export elasticity\u2014without nonlinearities or banking crisis controls\u2014is -0.3, consistent with prevailing \u201celasticity pessimism.\u201d This elasticity rises to between -0.5 and -0.8 within two years for depreciations above 20 percent without banking crises."

In early September, at Semicon Taiwan, <a href=\"https://www.topco-global.com/en/about/our-leadership\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Lee</a>, the managing director of Topco Group, a major semiconductor supplier, told <em>IEEE Spectrum </em>that manufacturers worry about grid stability as AI and semiconductor growth accelerates. \u201cHighly polluting coal-fired plants are no longer an option, so we will rely more on liquefied natural gas and less-stable renewables. If nuclear plants could be restarted, I would personally welcome it,\u201d Lee says.</p><p>Meanwhile, a memory manufacturing director, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he isn\u2019t authorized by his company to speak to the media, told <em>Spectrum </em>that Taiwan\u2019s economy is still manufacturing-driven. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the low efficiency of green energy.

Today she is a professor of electrical engineering at <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamia Millia Islamia University</a> in New Delhi, where she formerly was a dean.</p><h3>Mini Thomas</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Jamia Millia Islamia, in New Delhi</p><p><strong>Title: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Professor of electrical engineering</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong></p><p>Senior member</p><p><strong>Alma maters: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>University of Kerala; the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras; the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.</p><p>Thomas, an expert in power systems and smart grids, is working to get more women into the power and energy industry.</p><p>She is an active IEEE volunteer, having worked with student branches and membership recruitment. As a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/technology-sustainable-climate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization</a>, she shares her knowledge about energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and ozone-layer recovery.</p><p>\u201cFor a woman to succeed, she needs a lot of family support,\u201d Thomas says, because many women\u2019s careers are interrupted by caretaking and child-rearing responsibilities. She acknowledges that not all women have the same support system she has\u2014which is part of the reason why she is dedicated to helping others succeed.</p><h2>A passion for teaching</h2><p>Thomas was born and raised in Kerala, India. Kerala students who excelled at school were expected to choose a career in either medicine or engineering, she says. Medicine wasn\u2019t an option for her, she says, because she faints at the sight of blood. She was good at mathematics, though, so she chose to pursue engineering.</p><p>Although both her parents were teachers (her father taught chemistry; her mother was a language instructor), she wasn\u2019t inspired to pursue a similar path until she was an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://keralauniversity.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Kerala</a>. Her extensive note-taking during class made her popular among her classmates, she says, and some would ask her to tutor them during exam season.</p><p>\u201cMy friends would come over to my home so I could explain the material to them using my notes,\u201d she says. \u201cAfterward, they would tell me that they were able to understand the subject much better than how the professor had explained it. That\u2019s what inspired me to become a teacher.\u201d</p><p>After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1984, Thomas continued her education at the <a href=\"https://www.iitm.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>. Shortly after earning her master\u2019s of technology in electrical engineering in 1986, she began her first teaching job at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, also in Kerala.</p><p>The year was a whirlwind for Thomas, who got married, left her job, and moved to New Delhi, where her husband lived. Instead of searching for another teaching job, she decided to pursue a doctoral degree in the electrical engineering program at the <a href=\"https://www.iitd.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi</a>.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I was 28, I had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which I earned in 1990,\u201d she says. \u201cI soon got a job at Delhi Technological University, the only other college in New Delhi that had an engineering school at that time, other than IIT. From there, I never looked back.\u201d</p><p>She taught at the university for five years, then left in 1995 to join Jamia Millia Islamia. She eventually was promoted to lead the electrical engineering department.</p><p>During her 11 years there, she established labs to conduct research in supervisory control and data acquisition (<a href=\"https://inductiveautomation.com/resources/article/what-is-scada\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SCADA</a>) and substation automation, collaborating with industry on projects. In 2003 she created a curriculum for\u2014and led the launch of\u2014a master\u2019s of technology program in electrical power system management as well as a training program for industry professionals. For her work, she received a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/awards/meritorious-award\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities Board Meritorious Achievement Award</a>.</p><p>In 2014 she founded the school\u2019s <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/cie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a> to help startups turn their ideas into prototypes and launch businesses.</p><p>She received an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse in 2016: become president of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli.</p><p>\u201cThis was a great honor to become the first woman president of that institute,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the only woman among 90 presidents of all the institutions of national importance at that time.\u201d</p><p>But, she says, as president, she didn\u2019t have much time to teach, and after five years, she began to miss her time in the classroom. After her five-year term was completed, she returned to Jamia Millia Islamia in 2021 as engineering dean. Since then, she has led the launch of five programs: three undergraduate programs (in data science, electrical and computer engineering, and VLSI) and graduate programs in data science and environmental sciences.</p><p>This year she stepped down after completing her three-year term as dean and is focusing more on teaching.</p><p>She teaches at least one class each semester because, she says, she finds joy in \u201cimparting and giving knowledge to young minds.\u201d</p><h2>Mentoring women in the power industry</h2><p>Thomas mentors doctoral students as well as professors who aspire to serve as deans or other high-level positions.</p><p>In addition, she trains mid-career women in the power industry on the skills they need to get promoted\u2014to technical and senior management roles\u2014through the <a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/the-wepowernetwork.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">South Asia WePOWER network</a>\u2019s South Asia Region (SAR) 100 professional development program. WePOWER is a coalition of nonprofit and government organizations that aim to increase the number of women working in the power and energy sectors through education. A<a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/weesa-innovate-to-empower/documents.entry.html/2024/05/31/pathways_to_powersouthasiabaselineassessment-ILv3.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 2020 World Bank study</a> found that the percentage of women in technical roles in the industry in South Asia ranges from 0.1 to 21.</p><p>The six-month-long program provides technical training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to 100 women from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Thomas is one of 40 experts who remotely teach topics such as transmission details, distribution, renewable energy, and the importance of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-updates-2025\" target=\"_self\">women in leadership</a>.</p><p>She also mentors women to give them confidence and tools to reach leadership positions because \u201cmentorship is what changed my career trajectory,\u201d she says. When she first began teaching, she says she was reluctant to take high-level positions. But after participating in a six-day leadership training at the <a href=\"https://www.jnu.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a>, which was hosted by the Government of India\u2019s <a href=\"https://ugc.gov.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University Grants Commission</a>, she felt confident in her ability to move up the career ladder.</p><p>\u201cMany women take a break from their careers to raise their children, struggle to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/work-life-balance\" target=\"_self\">balance their personal and professional lives</a>, or don\u2019t have a support system,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to impart the lessons I learned from my experiences and the training I received. Whenever I get a chance, I get involved.\u201d</p><h2>Creating lifelong friendships and mentoring students</h2><p>Thomas joined IEEE in 1990 as a graduate student member and says she continues renewing her membership to stay up to date on emerging technologies, specifically SCADA systems.</p><p>\u201cI learned everything about SCADA from a tutorial developed by the <a href=\"https://ieee-pes.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Power & Energy Society</a>. There was no such material available at that time,\u201d she says.</p><p>Years later, in 2015, Thomas cowrote <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/power-system-scada-and-smart-grids-mini-s-thomas/1133718207\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Power System SCADA and Smart Grids</em></em></a> with her friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndougmcdonald\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John McDonald</a>, whom she met through the organization. McDonald is an IEEE Life Fellow and the founder and CEO of JDM Associates in Duluth, Ga.</p><p>Thomas became an active volunteer for the <a href=\"https://www.ieeedtu.in/IEEEDTU/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delhi Technological University\u2019s student branch</a>, where she helped organize technical talks and other events. When Thomas joined Jamia Millia Islamia, she revived the inactive <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/company/ieeejmi-sb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">student branch</a> there and served as its counselor for 14 years.</p><p>During her 35 years with IEEE, she has served as chair of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities/regional-list-region-10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Region 10</a> student activities committee and vice chair of membership development for <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities</a>. She was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/eab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities</a> and the <a href=\"https://pspb.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Publication Services and Products</a> boards.</p><p>\u201cCreating programs that benefit members makes me feel satisfied,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cVolunteering has also boosted my confidence.\u201d</p><p>She is also a member of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a>\u2019s editorial advisory board.</p><p>Not only does she attribute much of her professional growth to the organization, she also has created lifelong friendships through IEEE, she says. One friend is 2023 IEEE President <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/saifur-rahman-a\" target=\"_self\">Saifur Rahman</a>, whom she met in 2000 when he spoke to the Jamia Millia Islamia student branch.</p><p>\u201cOur friendship has grown so much that Saifur is like family,\u201d she says.</p><p>When Rahman launched the IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization in 2022, he asked Thomas to become a member. She helped create the <a href=\"https://innovate.ieee.org/the-ieee-climate-change-collection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Climate Change Collection</a> on the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Xplore</a> Digital Library. The following year, she led the development of a climate change taxonomy. The 620 words are included in the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Thesaurus</a>, which defines almost 12,500 engineering, technical, and scientific terms. Now she is working with a team to expand the taxonomy by defining hundreds more climate-change terms.</p><p>\u201cYou should always do what you enjoy. For me, that\u2019s teaching and volunteering with IEEE,\u201d she says. \u201cI could just be a member, access the technical content, and be happy with just that, but I volunteer because I can do things that help others.\u201d</p>"

This compact, open-source model can handle massive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-context-window\" target=\"_blank\">context windows</a> of 250,000 tokens (meaning that it can \u201cremember\u201d and reason over much more text than typical language models) and can run at high speed, even on consumer devices. The launch highlights a growing shift: smaller, more efficient models could shape the future of AI just as much as raw scale. </p><p>\u201cWe believe in a more decentralized future for AI\u2014one where not everything runs in massive data centers,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ori-goshen/\" target=\"_blank\">Ori Goshen</a>, Co-CEO of AI21, in an interview with <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>. \u201cLarge models will still play a role, but small, powerful models running on devices will have a significant impact\u201d on both the future and the economics of AI, he says. Jamba is built for developers who want to create edge-AI applications and specialized systems that run efficiently on-device.</p><p>AI21\u2019s Jamba Reasoning 3B is designed to handle long sequences of text and challenging tasks like math, coding, and logical reasoning\u2014all while running with impressive speed on everyday devices like laptops and mobile phones. Jamba Reasoning 3B can also work in a hybrid setup: simple jobs are handled locally by the device, while heavier problems get sent to powerful cloud servers. According to AI21, this smarter routing could dramatically cut AI infrastructure costs for certain workloads\u2014potentially by an order of magnitude.</p><h2>A Small but Mighty LLM</h2><p>With 3 billion parameters, Jamba Reasoning 3B is tiny by today\u2019s AI standards. Models like GPT-5 or Claude run well past 100 billion parameters, and even smaller models, such as Llama 3 (8B) or Mistral (7B), are more than twice the size of AI21\u2019s model, Goshen notes.</p><p>That compact size makes it more remarkable that AI21\u2019s model can handle a context window of 250,000 tokens on consumer devices. <span>Some proprietary models, like GPT-5, offer even longer context windows, but Jamba sets a new high-water mark among open-source models. The previous open-model</span><span> record of 128,000 tokens </span><span>was held by </span><span>Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2 (3B), Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 Mini, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepseek\" target=\"_blank\">DeepSeek R1</a>, which are all much larger models. </span><span>Jamba Reasoning 3B can process more than 17 tokens per second even when working at full capacity</span><span>\u2014that is, with</span><span> extremely long inputs that use its full 250,000-token context window. Many other models slow down or struggle once their input length exceeds 100,000 tokens.</span></p><p>Goshen explains that the model is built on an architecture called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887\" target=\"_blank\">Jamba</a>, which combines two types of neural network designs: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a> layers, familiar from other large language models, and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mamba-model\" target=\"_blank\">Mamba</a> layers, which are designed to be more memory-efficient. This hybrid design enables the model to handle long documents, large codebases, and other extensive inputs directly on a laptop or phone\u2014using about one-tenth the memory of traditional transformers. Goshen says the model runs much faster than traditional transformers because it relies less on a memory component called the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249\" target=\"_blank\">KV cache</a>, which can slow down processing as inputs get longer. </p><h2>Why Small LLMs Are Needed</h2><p>The model\u2019s hybrid architecture gives it an advantage in both speed and memory efficiency, even with very long inputs, confirms a software engineer who works in the LLM industry. The engineer requested anonymity because they\u2019re not authorized to comment on other companies\u2019 models. <span>As more users run generative AI locally on laptops, models need to handle long context lengths quickly without consuming too much memory. At 3 billion parameters, Jamba meets these requirements, says the engineer, making it a model that\u2019s optimized for on-device use.</span></p><p>Jamba Reasoning 3B is open source under the permissive <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 license</a> and available on popular platforms such as <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugging Face</a> and <a href=\"https://lmstudio.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">LM Studio</a>. The release also comes with instructions for fine-tuning the model through an open-source reinforcement-learning platform (called <a href=\"https://github.com/volcengine/verl\" target=\"_blank\">VERL</a>), making it easier and more affordable for developers to adapt the model for their own tasks.</p><p>\u201cJamba Reasoning 3B marks the beginning of a family of small, efficient reasoning models,\u201d Goshen said. \u201cScaling down enables decentralization, personalization, and cost efficiency. Instead of relying on expensive GPUs in data centers, individuals and enterprises can run their own models on devices. That unlocks new economics and broader accessibility.\u201d</p>"

The New York City school offers programs in design, fashion, art, communications, and business.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pixascale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PixaScale</a> won the startup category. Based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, the consultancy assists fashion and consumer goods companies with automating content, managing 3D digital assets, and improving workflows.</p><h2>Custom-made clothing by 3D and AI</h2><p>Ill-fitting garments, shoes, and accessories are problems for clothing companies. The average <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/media/clothing-return-rates-by-category-and-country-csf-a/#:~:text=Global%20Overview,in%20the%20region%20at%2022%2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">return rate worldwide for clothing ordered online is more than 25 percent</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PrimeAI</a>.</p><p>To make ready-to-wear clothing, designers use grading, a process that takes an initial sample pattern of a base size using established standards and 3D body scans, then makes smaller and larger versions to be mass-produced. But the resulting clothes do not fit everyone.</p><p>Returns, which can be frustrating for shoppers, are costly for clothing companies due to reshipping and restocking expenses.</p><p>Some customers can\u2019t be bothered to send back unwanted items, and they throw them in the garbage, where they end up in landfills.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we could go back to the days when you would go to a shop, get measured, and someone would custom-make your garment?\u201d posits <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-lavange-b0358a15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh LaVange</a>, an assistant professor of technical design and patternmaking at FIT.</p><p>That was the idea behind LaVange\u2019s winning project, Automated Custom Sizing. Her proposal uses 3D technology and AI to produce custom-tailored clothing on demand for all body types. She outlined short- and long-term scalable solutions in her submission.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d <strong>\u2014Leigh LaVange</strong></p><p>\u201cI see it [custom sizing] as a solution that can be automated and eventually rolled out across all different types of brands,\u201d she says.</p><p>The short-term proposal involves measuring a person\u2019s base body specifications, such as bust, waist, thighs, biceps, and hips\u2014either manually or from a 3D body scan. An avatar of the customer is then created and entered into a database preloaded with 3D representations of various sizes of the sample garment. The AI program notes the customer\u2019s specs and the existing sizes to determine the best fit. If, for example, the person\u2019s chest matches the medium-size dimensions but the hips are a few millimeters larger, the program still might recommend medium because it determined the material around the hips had enough excess fabric. A rendering of an avatar wearing an item is shown to customers to help them decide whether to make the purchase.</p><p>LaVange says her solution will help improve customer satisfaction and minimize returns.</p><p>Her long-term plan is a truly customized fit. Using 3D body scans, an AI program would determine the necessary adjustments to the pattern based on the customer\u2019s specifications and critical fit points, like the waist, while preserving the original design. The 3D system then would make alterations, which would be rendered on the customer\u2019s avatar for approval. The solution would eliminate excess inventory, LaVange says, because the clothing would be custom-made.</p><p>Because her proposals rely on technologies not currently used by the industry and a different way of interacting with customers, a shift in production would be required, she says.</p><p>\u201cMost manufacturing systems today are set up to produce as many units as possible in a single day,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a way to produce garments efficiently if you set up your manufacturing facility correctly. I want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d</p><h2>A digital asset management platform</h2><p>The winning submission in the startup category, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhl20Qr4Ss\" target=\"_blank\">AI-First DAM [digital asset management] as an Intelligent Backbone for Agile Product Development</a>, uses 3D technology and AI to combine components of clothing design into a centralized platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristian-sons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kristian Sons</a>, chief executive of Pixascale, launched the startup in February. He left <a href=\"https://www.adidas.com/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adidas</a> in January after nine years at the company, where he was the technical lead for digital creation.</p><p>Many apparel companies, Sons says, still store their 3D files on employees\u2019 local drives or on Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint</a>, a Web-based document-management system.</p><p>Those methods make things difficult because not everyone has access.</p><p>Sons\u2019 cloud-based platform addresses the issue by sharing digital assets, such as images, videos, 3D models, base styles, and documents, to all parties involved in the process.</p><p>That includes designers, seamstresses, and manufacturers. His system integrates with the client\u2019s file management system, providing access to the most recent images, renderings, and other relevant data.</p><p>His DAM system also includes a library of embellishments such as zippers and buttons, as well as fabric options.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and can understand what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration.\u201d <strong>\u2014Kristian Sons</strong></p><p>\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and track what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration,\u201d he says.</p><p>Sons also is working on incorporating <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-economy\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> and large language models to connect with internal systems and application programming interfaces to autonomously conduct simple research requests.</p><p>That might include suggesting new products or different silhouettes, or modifying the previous season\u2019s offerings with new colors, Sons says.</p><p>\u201cThese AI agents certainly will not be perfect, but they are a good starting point so designers don\u2019t have to start from scratch,\u201d he says. \u201cI think using AI agents is super exciting because in the past few years in the fashion industry, we have been talking about how AI would do the creative parts, like designing a product.

A senior studying biomedical engineering at the<a href=\"https://www.uanl.mx/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n</a> (UANL), in Monterrey, Mexico, she is the founding chair of her school\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.embs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</a> (EMBS) student branch. The student member\u2019s research interests in<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neuroscience\" target=\"_self\"> neuroengineering</a> and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> artificial intelligence</a> are shaping her vision for the future of health care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about technology and health,\u201d she says. \u201cBiomedical engineering is giving me a way to combine these two worlds and work on solutions that make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>Her growing influence in<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE</a> coupled with her academic achievements signal a promising, influential career.</p><h2>From chemistry to caring </h2><p>Ramirez was born in<a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/676/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Zacatecas, Mexico</a>, known for its silver mines, agriculture, and strong cultural pride. From a young age, she loved science\u2014particularly chemistry\u2014and thrived in schools designated for advanced learners.</p><p>Her first exposure to the health care field came during high school, when she trained as a nursing technician. Her high school curriculum was organized as a co-op program, which included traditional classes alternating with internships in nursing. Ramirez interned at the <a href=\"https://www.medicina.uanl.mx/hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez</a> in Monterrey, Mexico.</p><p>Alternating between the academic and vocational tracks allowed her to graduate with a diploma and a technical degree at the same time. Speaking of her early experiences, she says, \u201cI saw how many patients struggled, not just with their conditions but also with the logistics of seeking and coordinating treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat made me want to work at the intersection of medicine and innovation.\u201d</p><p>With her father working as a materials engineer and her mother as an accountant, she grew up in a household where technical problem-solving and analytical thinking were part of daily life.</p><p>That blend of influences reinforced her decision to pursue engineering as a career rather than the medical field, she says.</p><h2>Exploring neuroengineering and AI</h2><p>Since beginning her studies at UANL in 2021, Ramirez has focused on neuroengineering, one of three specializations the school offers. She has explored the role artificial intelligence plays in diagnosing and treating conditions including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alzheimers-disease\" target=\"_self\"> Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\"> </a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression\" target=\"_self\">depression</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\">, epilepsy</a>, and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/schizophrenia\" target=\"_self\"> schizophrenia</a>.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_self\">IEEE mentoring program</a>, she received guidance from global experts including a doctor from India who helped refine her early AI projects.</p><p>Her work quickly evolved from class assignments to projects with real-world potential.</p><p>\u201cThe project I\u2019m most excited about has not been published, but it mainly consisted of using convolutional neural networks in medical image processing (MRI) and machine learning in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases,\u201d she says.</p><p>This year she broadened her scope by attending the IEEE<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Conference on Robotics and Automation</a> in Atlanta, where she gained exposure to both industrial and academic applications of robotics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick. I want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Currently she is an intern at <a href=\"https://www.aunainvestors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Auna</a>, a health care network in Latin America. She contributes to improving the patient experience in hospitals across Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.</p><p>\u201cI design projects aimed at improving the quality of care and making the hospital intervention more effective for patients across different stages: prevention/wellness, diagnosis, hospitalization, rehabilitation, and post-discharge follow-up,\u201d She declined to provide specific examples, citing medical confidentiality agreements.</p><p>\u201cMy internship is about finding ways to make health care not just effective but also more humane,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about improving processes so patients feel cared for\u2014from the moment they enter the hospital until they leave.\u201d</p><h2>Finding leadership and purpose in IEEE</h2><p>Ramirez founded the IEEE EMBS student branch in 2023. As chair, she represents the branch at <a href=\"https://r9.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Region 9</a> meetings, where she advocates for mentorship opportunities and collaboration with other IEEE groups.</p><p>Through her involvement, she says, she has gained not only technical knowledge but also critical soft skills in leadership, time management, and teamwork.</p><p>\u201cIEEE taught me how to lead with empathy and how to work with people from different backgrounds,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has expanded my vision beyond Mexico, showing me challenges and innovations happening all over the world.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree abroad\u2014potentially in public health or AI for medical devices\u2014and ultimately a Ph.D. Her long-term goal is to launch a business focused on developing health care innovations, specifically in disease prevention.</p><h2>A future built on innovation</h2><p>For Ramirez, improving health care means more than developing cutting-edge technology. It also involves rethinking how people understand and manage their own health.</p><p>\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Her vision is as ambitious as it is personal, rooted in her own journey from Zacatecas to Monterrey and beyond.</p><p>As her career advances, she says, she intends to keep IEEE at the center of her professional life.</p><p>\u201cIn IEEE I\u2019ve found a community that challenges me to grow, supports me when I fail, and celebrates when I succeed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about engineering; it\u2019s about building a better future, together.\u201d</p>"

And all the extra computations consuming all that added power from advanced chips are generating unmanageable amounts of heat.</p><p>\u201cThe average power density in a rack was around 8 kW,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-claman-3438731/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Claman</a>, CEO of the startup <a href=\"https://accelsius.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accelsius</a>. \u201cFor AI, that\u2019s growing to 100 kW per rack. That\u2019s an order of magnitude. It\u2019s really AI adoption that\u2019s creating this real urgency\u201d to figure out a better way to cool data centers.</p><p>Specifically, the urgency is to move away from fans and toward some sort of liquid cooling. For example, water has roughly four times the specific heat of air and is about 800 times as dense, meaning it can absorb around 3,200 times as much heat as a comparable volume of air can. What\u2019s more, the thermal conductivity of water is 23.5 times as high as that of air, meaning that heat transfers to water much more readily.</p><p>\u201cYou can stick your hand into a hot oven and you won\u2019t get burned. You stick your hand into a pot of boiling water and you can instantly get third-degree burns,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eganseamus/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seamus Egan</a>, general manager of immersion cooling at <a href=\"https://www.airedale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Airedale by Modine</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s because the liquid transfers heat much, much, much, much more quickly.\u201d</p><p>The data-center industry by and large agrees that cooling chips with liquid is the future, at least for AI-focused data centers. \u201cAs AI has made racks denser and hotter, liquid cooling has become the de facto solution,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karin-overstreet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Karin Overstreet</a>, president of <a href=\"https://www.nortekdatacenter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nortek Data Center Cooling</a>, said via email.</p><p>But there are a number of ways to do liquid cooling, from the simple and straightforward to the complex and slightly weird.</p><p>At the simple end, there\u2019s circulating chilled water through cold plates attached to the hottest chips. Then there\u2019s circulating not water but a special dielectric fluid that boils inside the cold plate to take away the heat. A third approach is dunking the entire server into a fluid that keeps it cool. And, last and most splashy, is dunking the server into a boiling vat of liquid.</p><p>Which method will end up being the industry standard for the high-end AI factories of the future? At this point, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Here\u2019s how the four methods work, and where they might find the most use.</p><h2>#1: Single-Phase Direct-to-Chip Cooling</h2><p>The most technologically mature approach is to use water. Already, many AI data centers are employing such direct-to-chip liquid cooling for their hottest chips.</p><p>In this scheme, metal blocks, called cold plates, with channels in them for coolant to circulate, are placed directly on top of the chips. The cold plates match the size of the chips and go inside the server. The liquid is usually water, with some glycol added to prevent bacterial growth, stabilize the temperature, protect against freezing and corrosion, and increase the viscosity of the liquid. The glycol-water mixture is forced through the cold plate, whisking away heat right from the source.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two computer servers with wires and water pipes coming out. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7627e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-computer-servers-with-wires-and-water-pipes-coming-out.png?id=61730623&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Companies like Mikros Technologies are pursuing single-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling. In this technique, a cold plate is placed on top of the hottest chips. Liquid is circulated through the cold plate, whisking away heat. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.marvell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Marvell Technology</a></small></p>The glycol water is normally kept in a closed loop, circulating from the cold plates to a heat-exchange unit, which cools the liquid back down, and then back to the cold plate. Inside the heat exchanger, a separate loop of \u201cfacility water\u201d is used to cool down the glycol water. The facility water is in turn cooled by either a chiller\u2014an electrically powered refrigeration unit\u2014or a dry cooler, an outdoor unit that uses fans to blow ambient air over the water as it moves through pipes. A dry cooler is much simpler and more energy efficient than a chiller, but it works only in cooler climates\u2014it can\u2019t cool the water below the ambient temperature.<p><span>One difficulty with this approach is that putting a cold plate on every single heat-producing component in a server is unfeasible. It only makes sense to put cold plates on the most energy-dense components\u2014namely GPUs and some CPUs\u2014leaving smaller components, like power supplies and memory units, to be cooled the old-fashioned way, with fans.</span></p><p><strong>\u201c</strong>The trend is moving toward a hybrid-cooling solution,\u201d Overstreet says. \u201cSo liquid cooling does about 80 percent of the cooling for the server room or the data hall, and about 20 percent is the existing air-cooling solution.\u201d</p><h2>#2: Two-Phase Direct-to-Chip Cooling</h2><p>With GPU power densities showing no signs of leveling off, direct-to-chip water cooling is hitting a limit. You can, of course, increase the flow of water, but that will use more energy. Or you can operate the chips at a higher temperature, which will cut into their performance and in the long run degrade the chips. Fortunately, there\u2019s a third option: to squeeze a bit more out of the physics of heat exchange.</p><p>The extra cooling power offered by physics comes from latent heat\u2014that is, the energy it takes to change phase, in this case from liquid to gas. As the liquid boils off the GPU, it absorbs that extra latent heat as it turns into gas, without increasing temperature.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Dark blue server room with five little windows showing liquid inside\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b317d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/dark-blue-server-room-with-five-little-windows-showing-liquid-inside.png?id=61730633&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Companies like Accelsius are proposing two-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling. Here, a cold plate is also placed on top of the hottest chips, and the liquid circulating through the cold plate boils directly atop the chip. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Big Idea Productions</small></p>That\u2019s basically how two-phase direct-to-chip cooling works. In this scheme, a specially formulated dielectric liquid circulates through cold plates sitting atop high-energy chips and boils into vapor. The vapor is then fed back to a heat exchanger, which cools the fluid using facility water.<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really boiling to cool,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mydtruong/\" target=\"_blank\">My Truong</a>, chief technology officer of the startup <a href=\"https://zutacore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ZutaCore</a>, which makes two-phase direct-to-chip cooling systems.</p><p><span>Water boils at 100 \u00b0C (at atmospheric pressure), which is too high for proper chip operation. So you need a specially formulated fluid with a lower boiling point. ZutaCore\u2019s chief evangelist, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahar-belkin-0b01079/?originalSubdomain=il\" target=\"_blank\">Shahar Belkin</a><span>, explains that the fluid they use is sourced from chemical suppliers like Honeywell and Chemours, and boils at a temperature as low as 18 \u00b0C, which can be adjusted up or down by tweaking the pressure in the loop. In addition, the fluid is dielectric\u2014it\u2019s not electrically charged unless polarized by an external electric field. So, unlike water, if some of the fluid spills onto the electronics, it won\u2019t damage the costly equipment.</span></p><p>With water, the temperature increases drastically as it flows over the hot chips. That means the incoming water needs to be kept cold, and so the facility water requires cooling with chillers in most climates.</p><p>With boiling dielectric fluid, however, the fluid remains roughly the same temperature and simply changes phase into a vapor. That means both the liquid and the facility water can be kept at a higher temperature, resulting in significant energy savings.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">When liquid boils on top of a hot chip, the chip is cooled not only through contact with the cooler liquid, but also through the latent heat it takes to induce a phase change. </small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Accelsius</small></p><p><span>\u201cBecause of the really efficient boiling process that happens on the cold plate, we can accept facility water that\u2019s 6 to 8 degrees warmer than [with] single phase,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-beran-60a563101/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucas Beran</a><span>, director of product marketing at </span><a href=\"https://accelsius.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Accelsius</a><span>, another startup working on two-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling.</span></p><p>The two-phase setup also requires lower liquid flow rates than the traditional single-phase water approach, so it uses less energy and runs less risk of damaging the equipment. The flow rate of two-phase cooling is about one-fifth that of single-phase cooling, Belkin says.</p><p>With single-phase water cooling, he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to flow a gallon per minute into the cold plate\u201d for the most advanced chips running at 2,000 W. \u201cThis means very, very high pressure, very, very high flow. It means that pumping will be expensive, and [the cooling system] will actually harm itself with the high flow.\u201d</p><h2>#3: Single-Phase Immersion Cooling</h2><p>Direct-to-chip liquid cooling offers much more cooling capacity than just blowing air, but it still relies on cold plates as intermediaries to do the cooling.</p><p>What if you could bypass the cold plate altogether and just dunk the entire computer server in coolant? Some companies are doing just that.</p><p>In this approach, the data center is arranged around immersion tanks rather than racks, each tank roughly the size of a refrigerator. The immersion tanks are filled with a dielectric fluid, usually an oil, which must be nonconductive and have strong thermal transfer properties, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-bielstein-8a92986b/\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Bielstein</a>, global sales manager of immersion cooling at <a href=\"https://baltimoreaircoil.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">Baltimore Aircoil Co.</a> The fluid also requires long-term stability and low environmental and fire risk.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A server with Nvidia labels submerged in liquid. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e2411\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-server-with-nvidia-labels-submerged-in-liquid.png?id=61730648&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sustainable Metal Cloud is advocating for single-phase immersion cooling, in which an entire server is submerged in a vat of liquid to keep it cool.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"http://firmus.co\" target=\"_blank\">Firmus Technologies</a></small></p><p>With immersion cooling, everything gets cooled by the same fluid. After the oil has whisked away the heat, there are various approaches to cooling the immersion fluid. Baltimore Aircoil, for one, has designed a heat exchanger that circulates facility water through coils and plates inside the tank, Bielstein explains. \u201cThe heated water is then pumped to an outside cooler that releases the heat into the air, cools the water, and sends it back to the heat exchanger to absorb more heat from the tank. This process uses up to 51 percent less energy versus traditional designs.\u201d</p><p>The team at Singapore-based <a href=\"https://smc.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Metal Cloud</a> (SMC), which builds immersion-cooling systems for data centers, has figured out the modifications that need to be made to servers to make them compatible with this cooling method. Beyond removing the built-in fans, the company swaps out the thermal-interface materials that connect chips to their heat sinks, as some of those materials degrade in the oil. Oliver Curtis, co-CEO of SMC and its sister company Firmus, told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> the modifications they make are small but important to the functioning of SMC\u2019s setup.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve created the perfect operating environment for a computer,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThere\u2019s no dust, no movement, no vibration, because there\u2019s no fans. And it\u2019s a perfect operating temperature.\u201d</p><p>There are some chips whose power density is still too high to be completely cooled by the slow-moving oil. In those cases, it\u2019s necessary to add cold plates to increase the oil flow over them. \u201cSingle-phase immersion has already hit the limits\u201d for cooling these advanced chips, says Egan of Airedale by Modine. Adding cold plates to immersion cooling, he says, \u201cwill definitely provide support for more advanced chip architectures and reduce the heat load on the single-phase dielectric fluid. The new challenge is that I now need two separate cooling-loop systems.\u201d</p><h2>#4: Two-Phase Immersion Cooling</h2><p>If no one cooling method is enough on its own, how about putting all of them together, and dunking your data center into a vat of boiling oil?</p><p>Some companies already are.</p><p>\u201cTwo-phase immersion is probably the most moon-shot technology when it comes to data-center liquid cooling,\u201d says Beran, of Accelsius.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonhvac/\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon Marshall</a>, global marketing manager of data-center liquid cooling at <a href=\"https://www.chemours.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Chemours</a>, says this is where the industry is headed. \u201cWe believe from the research that we\u2019ve done that two-phase immersion is going to come up in a pretty reasonable way.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"[left] Man in labcoat stands next to black box with a window onto a server.

In this approach, the server is dunked into a vat of liquid, and the liquid boils atop the hot components, cooling the system. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chemours</small></p><p>Marshall argues that a two-phase\u2014also known as boiling\u2014liquid has 10 to 100 times as much cooling capacity as a single-phase liquid, due to its latent heat. And while two-phase direct-to-chip cooling may work for the chips of today, it still leaves many components, such as memory modules and power supplies, to be air cooled. As CPUs and GPUs grow more powerful, these memory modules and power supplies will also require liquid cooling.</p><p>\u201cThat list of problems is not going anywhere,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cI think the immersion-cooling piece is going to continue to grow in interest as we move forward. People are going to get more comfortable with having a two-phase fluid inside of a rack just like they have [with] putting water in a rack through single-phase direct-to-chip technology.\u201d</p><p>In their lab in Newark, Del., the Chemours team has placed several high-power servers in tanks filled with a proprietary, specially formulated fluid. The fluid is dielectric, so as not to cause shorts, and it\u2019s also noncorrosive and designed to boil at the precise temperature at which the chips are to be held. The fluid boils directly on top of the hot chips. Then the vapor condenses on a cooled surface, either at the top or the back panel of the tank.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In their lab in Newark, Dela., the Chemours team is testing their two-phase immersion cooling fluid.

The temperature required to condense our fluid can eliminate the need for chillers and other complex mechanical infrastructure in most cases.\u201d</p><p>According to a recent <a href=\"https://pages.chemours.com/IC-Case-Study-October-2024.html?utm_medium=landingpage&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=2024-immersion_cooling_casestudycampaign_registered&amp;utm_content=ocp_eventpage&amp;utm_term=eng-international-downloadassets\" target=\"_blank\">case study</a> by Chemours researchers, two-phase immersion cooling is more cost effective than single-phase immersion or single-phase direct-to-chip in most climates. For example, in Ashburn, Va., the 10-year total cost of ownership was estimated at US $436 million for a single-phase direct-to-chip setup, $491 million for a single-phase immersion setup, and $433 million for a two-phase immersion-cooling setup, mostly due to lower power requirements and a simplified mechanical system.</p><p>Critics argue that two-phase immersion makes it hard to maintain the equipment, especially since the oils are so specialized, expensive, and prone to evaporating. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an immersion tank, and there\u2019s dollar signs evaporating from it, that can make it a bit of a challenge to service,\u201d Beran says.</p><p>However, Egan of Airedale by Modine says his company has developed a way to mostly avoid this issue with its immersion tanks, which are intended for edge applications. \u201cOur EdgeBox is specifically designed to maintain the vapor layer lower down in the tank with a layer of air above it and closer to the tank lid. When the tank is opened (for a short maintenance period), the vapor layer does not \u2018flow out\u2019 of the tank,\u201d Egan wrote via email. \u201cThe vapor is much heavier than air and therefore stays lower in the tank. The minimal vapor loss is offset by a buffer tank of fluid within the system.\u201d</p><p>For the foreseeable future, people in the industry agree that the power demands of AI will keep going up, and the need for cooling along with them.</p><p>\u201cUnless the floor falls out from under AI and everybody stops building these AI clusters, and stops building the hardware to perform training for large language models, we\u2019re going to need to keep advancing cooling, and we\u2019re going to need to solve the heat problem,\u201d Marshall says.</p><p>Which cooling technology will dominate in the coming AI factories? It\u2019s too soon to say. But the rapidly changing nature of data centers is opening up the field to a lot of inventiveness and innovation.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not only a great market for liquid cooling,\u201d says Drew Matter, of Mikros Technologies, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a fun engineering problem.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

These neurons can, for the first time, process information from living cells without an intermediary device amplifying or modulating the signals, the researchers say.</p><p>While some <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-hardware-mimics-spiking-behavior-of-neurons-with-high-efficiency\" target=\"_blank\">artificial neurons</a> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-first-single-device-to-act-like-a-neuron\" target=\"_blank\">already exist</a>, they require electronic amplification to sense the signals our bodies produce, explains <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/engineering/about/directory/jun-yao\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jun Yao</a>, who works on bioelectronics and nanoelectronics at UMass Amherst. The amplification inflates both power usage and circuit complexity, and so counters efficiencies found in the brain.</p><p>The neuron created by Yao\u2019s team can understand the body\u2019s signals at their natural amplitude of around 0.1 volts. This is \u201chighly novel,\u201d says <a href=\"https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/bozhi-tian\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bozhi Tian</a>, a biophysicist who studies living bioelectronics at the University of Chicago and was not involved in the work. This work \u201cbridges the long-standing gap between electronic and biological signaling\u201d and demonstrates interaction between artificial neurons and living cells that Tian calls \u201cunprecedented.\u201d</p><h2>Real neurons and artificial neurons</h2><p>Biological <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/four-types-of-brain-cells-identified-based-on-electrical-spiking-activity\" target=\"_self\">neurons</a> are the fundamental building blocks of the brain. If external stimuli are strong enough, charge builds up in a neuron, triggering an action potential, a spike of voltage that travels down the neuron\u2019s body to enable all types of bodily functions, including emotion and movement.</p><p>Scientists have been working to engineer a synthetic neuron for decades, chasing after the efficiency of the human brain, which has so far seemed to escape the abilities of electronics.</p><p>Yao\u2019s group has designed new artificial neurons that mimic how biological neurons sense and react to electrical signals. They use sensors to monitor external biochemical changes and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-devices-ai\" target=\"_self\">memristors</a>\u2014essentially resistors with memory\u2014to emulate the action-potential process. </p><p>As voltage from the external biochemical events increases, ions accumulate and begin to form a filament across a gap in the memristor\u2014which in this case was filled with protein nanowires. If there is enough voltage, the filament completely bridges the gap. Current shoots through the device and the filament then dissolves, dispersing the ions and stopping the current. The complete process mimics a neuron\u2019s action potential. </p><p>The team tested its artificial neurons by connecting them to cardiac tissue. The devices measured a baseline amount of cellular contraction, which did not produce enough signal to cause the artificial neuron to fire. Then the researchers took another measurement after the tissue was dosed with norepinephrine\u2014a drug that increases how frequently cells contract. The artificial neurons triggered action potentials only during the medicated trial, proving that they can detect changes in living cells. </p><p>The experimental results were published 29 September in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63640-7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Nature Communications</em></em></a>.</p><h2>Natural nanowires</h2><p>The group has <em><em>G. sulfurreducens</em></em> to thank for the breakthrough. </p><p>The microbes synthesize miniature cables, called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/genetically-modified-bacteria-conduct-electricity-ushering-in-new-era-of-green-electronics\" target=\"_blank\">protein nanowires</a>, that they use for intraspecies communication. These cables are charge conductors that survive for long periods of time in the wild without decaying. (Remember, they evolved for Oklahoma ditches.) They\u2019re extremely stable, even for device fabrication, Yao says.</p><p>To the engineers, the most notable property of the nanowires is how efficiently ions move along them. The nanowires offer a low-energy means of transferring charge between human cells and artificial neurons, thus avoiding the need for a separate amplifier or modulator. \u201cAnd amazingly, the material is designed for this,\u201d says Yao.</p><p>The group developed a method to shear the cables off bacterial bodies, purifying the material and suspending it in a solution. The team laid the mixture out and let the water evaporate, leaving a one-molecule-thin film made from the protein nanowire material.</p><p>This efficiency allows the artificial neuron to yield huge power savings. Yao\u2019s group integrated the film into the memristor at the core of the neuron, lowering the energy barrier for the reaction that causes the memristor to respond to signals recognized by the sensor. With this innovation, the researchers say, the artificial neuron uses one-tenth the voltage and 1/100 the power of others. </p><p>Chicago\u2019s Tian thinks this \u201cextremely impressive\u201d energy efficiency is \u201cessential for future low-power, implantable, and biointegrated computing systems.\u201d</p><p>The power advantages make this synthetic-neuron design attractive for all kinds of applications, the researchers say. </p><p>Responsive wearable electronics, like prosthetics that adapt to stimuli from the body, could make use of these new artificial neurons, Tian says. Eventually, implantable systems that rely on the neurons could \u201clearn like living tissues, advancing personalized medicine and brain-inspired computing\u201d to \u201cinterpret physiological states, leading to biohybrid networks that merge electronics with living intelligence,\u201d he says.</p><p>The artificial neurons could also be useful in electronics outside the biomedical field. Millions of them on a chip could replace transistors, completing the same tasks while decreasing power usage, Yao says. The fabrication process for the neurons does not involve high temperatures and utilizes the same kind of photolithography that silicon chip manufacturers do, he says.</p><p>Yao does, however, point out two possible bottlenecks producers could face when scaling up these artificial neurons for electronics. The first is obtaining more of the protein nanowires from <em><em>G. sulfurreducens</em></em>. His lab currently works for three days to generate only 100 micrograms of material\u2014about the mass of one grain of table salt. And that amount can coat only a very small device, so Yao questions how this step in the process could scale up for production. </p><p>His other concern is how to achieve a uniform coating of the film at the scale of a silicon wafer. \u201cIf you wanted to make high-density small devices, the uniformity of film thickness actually is a critical parameter,\u201d he explains. But the artificial neurons his group has developed are too small to do any meaningful uniformity testing for now. </p><p>Tian doesn\u2019t expect artificial neurons to replace silicon transistors in conventional computing, but instead sees them as a parallel offering for \u201chybrid chips that merge biological adaptability with electronic precision,\u201d he says.</p><p>In the far future, Yao hopes that such bioderived devices will also be appreciated for not contributing to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/e-waste\" target=\"_self\">e-waste</a>. When a user no longer wants a device, they can simply dump the biological component in the surrounding environment, Yao says, because it won\u2019t cause an environmental hazard. </p><p><span>\u201cBy using this kind of nature-derived, microbial material, we can create a greener technology that\u2019s more sustainable for the world,\u201d Yao says.</span></p>"

With individual chargers drawing 350 to 500 kilowatts (<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/byd-megawatt-charging\" target=\"_blank\">or more</a>)\u2014which makes EV charging times now functionally equivalent to the fill-up time for a gasoline or diesel vehicle\u2014full charging sites can reach megawatt-scale demand. That\u2019s enough to strain </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-line-sensors-smart-grid\" target=\"_self\">medium-voltage distribution networks</a>\u2014the segment of the grid that links high-voltage transmission lines with the low-voltage lines that serve end users in homes and businesses.</p><p><span>DC fast-charging stations tend to be clustered in urban centers, along highways, and in fleet depots. Because the load is not spread evenly across the network, particular substations are overworked\u2014even when overall grid capacity is rated to accommodate the load. <strong> </strong>Overcoming this problem, as more charging stations, with greater power demands, come online requires power electronics that are not only compact and efficient but also capable of managing local storage and renewable inputs.<strong></strong></span></p><h2>Solid-State Transformers in EV Charging</h2><p><span>One of the most promising technologies for modernizing the grid so it can keep up with the demands of vehicle electrification and renewable generation is the solid-state transformer (SST). An SST performs the same basic function  as a conventional transformer\u2014stepping voltage up or down. But it does so using semiconductors, high-frequency conversion with silicon carbide or gallium nitride switches, and digital control, instead of passive magnetic coupling alone. An SST\u2019s setup allows it to control power flow dynamically.</span></p><p><span><strong></strong></span><span>For decades, charging infrastructure has relied on </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-crisis\" target=\"_self\">line-frequency transformers</a><span> (LFTs)\u2014massive assemblies of iron and copper that step down medium-voltage AC to low-voltage AC before  or after external conversion from alternating current to the direct current that EV batteries require. <span>A typical LFT can contain as much as a few hundred kilograms of copper windings and a few tonnes of iron. All that metal is </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-shortage\" target=\"_self\">costly and increasingly difficult to source</a><span>. </span><span>These systems are reliable but bulky and inefficient, especially when energy flows between local storage and vehicles. SSTs are much smaller and lighter than the LFTs they are designed to replace.</span></span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\"> \u201cOur solution achieves the same semiconductor device count as a single-port converter while providing multiple independently controlled DC outputs.\u201d \u2014<strong>Shashidhar Mathapati, Delta Electronics</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>But most multiport SSTs developed so far have been too complex or costly (between five and 10 times as much as the upfront cost of LFTs). That difference\u2014plus SSTs\u2019 reliance on auxiliary battery banks that add more expense and reduce reliability\u2014explains why solid-state\u2019s obvious benefits have not yet<strong> </strong>incentivized shifting to the technology from LFTs. <strong></strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Surjakanta Mazumder,  Saichand Kasicheyanula, Harisyam P.V. and Kaushik Basu holding their prototype in a lab.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"188c5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/surjakanta-mazumder-saichand-kasicheyanula-harisyam-p-v-and-kaushik-basu-holding-their-prototype-in-a-lab.jpg?id=61740711&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">   Surjakanta Mazumder,    Saichand Kasicheyanula, Harisyam P.V., and Kaushik Basu hold their SST prototype in a lab.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131460\" target=\"_blank\">Harisyam P.V., Saichand Kasicheyanula, et al.</a></small></p><h2>How to Make Solid-State Transformers More Efficient</h2><h2></h2><p>In a <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131460\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> published on 20 August in <em><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=63\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics</a></em>, researchers at <a href=\"https://iisc.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">the Indian Institute of Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deltaelectronicsindia.com/en-IN/index\" target=\"_blank\">Delta Electronics India</a>, both in Bengaluru, proposed what\u2019s called a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)\u2013based multiport SST that eliminates those compromises. \u201cOur solution achieves the same semiconductor device count as a single-port converter while providing multiple independently controlled DC outputs,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/delta-electronics-india_deltaelectronicsindia-designinindia-designforindia-activity-7311299447068471296-NUOX\" target=\"_blank\">Shashidhar Mathapati</a>, the chief technology officer of Delta Electronics. \u201cThat means no additional battery storage, no extra semiconductor devices, and no extra medium-voltage insulation.\u201d</p><p>The team built a 1.2-kilowatt laboratory prototype to validate the design, achieving 95.3 percent efficiency at rated load. They also modeled a full-scale 11-kilovolt, 400-kW system divided into two 200-kW ports.</p><h2></h2><p>At the heart of the system is a multiwinding transformer located on the low-voltage side of the converter. This configuration avoids the need for costly, bulky medium-voltage insulation and allows power balancing between ports without auxiliary batteries. \u201cPrevious CHB-based multiport designs needed multiple battery banks or capacitor networks to even out the load,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown you can achieve the same result with a simpler, lighter, and more reliable transformer arrangement.\u201d</p><p>A new modulation and control strategy maintains a unity power factor at the grid interface, meaning that none of the current coming from the grid goes to waste by oscillating back and forth between the source and the load without doing any work. The SST described by the authors also allows each DC port to operate independently. In practical terms, each vehicle connected to the charger would be able to receive the appropriate voltage and current, without affecting neighboring ports or disturbing the grid connection.</p><h2></h2><p>Using silicon carbide switches connected in series, the system can handle medium-voltage inputs while maintaining high efficiency. An 11-kV grid connection would require just 12 cascaded modules per phase, which is roughly half as many as some modular multilevel converter designs. Fewer modules ultimately means lower cost, simpler control, and greater reliability.</p><p>Although still at the laboratory stage, the design could enable a new generation of compact, cost-effective fast-charging hubs. By removing the need for intermediate battery storage\u2014which adds cost, complexity, and maintenance\u2014the proposed topology could extend the operational lifespan of EV charging stations.</p><p>According to the researchers, this converter is not just for EV charging. Any application that needs medium-voltage to multiport low-voltage conversion\u2014such as data centers, renewable integration, or industrial DC grids\u2014could benefit.</p><p>For utilities and charging providers facing megawatt-scale demand, this streamlined solid-state transformer could help make the EV revolution more grid-friendly, and faster for drivers waiting to charge.</p>"

Naively, it appears that Cursor is making a meaningful percentage of coders obsolete.</p><p>This begs the question: Is it even worth learning to code anymore? </p><p>The answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The above fear-based analysis of Cursor misses several important points.</p><p>First, the demand for software is insatiable. Getting a computer to follow our instructions properly (i.e., coding) is economically incredibly valuable. However, for decades now, the number of people with the specialized skill to communicate with computers has been limited. If AI tools let us write more functional code, many more people, companies, and industries will benefit. As Marc Andreesen famously alluded to in his 2011 essay \u201c<a href=\"https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Why Software Is Eating the World</a>,\u201d the demand for software is elastic. As software becomes cheaper, we see a disproportionately large increase in demand. </p><p>There\u2019s no such thing as finishing a software project. Humans are very good at demanding more products and services, and software will inevitably play a role in that future.</p><p>Another critical observation is that AI-assisted code is simply a continuation of the evolution of software development. In the 1970s, we used to program with punch cards. Then we started writing low-level code with a keyboard. Then we shifted to higher-level languages. Each successive era saw large increases in the number of software engineers while simultaneously improving the productivity of each person. We\u2019ve seen this storyline before: AI is just another tool to give us superpowers.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-ai-coding-tools\" target=\"_self\">Coding tools</a> like Cursor or Devin are less about replacing software engineers than they are about increasing the number of software engineers. Going forward, writing code won\u2019t be restricted to those with a particular title; everyone including lawyers, accountants, and doctors will develop software. Cursor won\u2019t replace the 25 million software engineers we have today.

It will be copper.</p><p>The world is building AI like it\u2019s Minecraft, stacking <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers\" target=\"_blank\">data centers</a>, transmission lines, and cooling systems with little regard for the physical limits beneath them. Everyone is focused on models and computation, but few acknowledge the metal that makes them run.</p><p>Every piece of modern electrical infrastructure\u2014not just AI\u2014depends on copper. AI data centers are simply accelerating demand. One hyperscale facility can require tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. For example, one Microsoft data center <a href=\"https://www.bhp.com/news/bhp-insights/2025/01/why-ai-tools-and-data-centres-are-driving-copper-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">used over 2,000 tonnes</a>, or 27 tonnes per megawatt. A McKinsey report predicts that overall transmission build-out could push annual global copper demand up to about <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/bridging-the-copper-supply-gap\" target=\"_blank\">37 million tonnes by 2031</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-mining\" target=\"_blank\">Accessible copper is running out</a>. More than 70 percent of global reserves are locked in ores that conventional mining struggles to process efficiently. Tens of billions of tons sit idle in waste piles and marginal deposits, overlooked by industry but still rich with potential.</p><p>That potential is what drew me here. As a geoscientist who later worked in energy and cloud infrastructure, I saw firsthand the growing need for copper\u2014and realized I had the knowledge to help address it. In 2023, I founded a startup called <a href=\"https://www.endolithmining.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Endolith</a> to recover copper from these forgotten sources. The tool is not drills or dynamite. It\u2019s microbes.</p><h2>How microbial mining works</h2><p>These microbes are naturally evolved, field-deployable, and highly effective at <a href=\"https://www.endolithmining.com/technology#copper\" target=\"_blank\">recovering copper</a> from complex ores such as chalcopyrite and enargite. They thrive in leaching heaps under real-world conditions, working with real customers. And the bonus: They use less energy, deliver more copper, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional methods.</p><p>And what are those traditional methods? Typically, mines extract copper from ores by grinding the rock, concentrating the ore, and then using high-temperature smelting or chemical leaching with strong acids. Both approaches are energy-intensive, slow to unlock copper, and leave behind large volumes of waste and emissions.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A researcher in a lab coat, safety glasses, and purple gloves holds a long pointed device up to a petri dish with a translucent material in it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b9a19\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-researcher-in-a-lab-coat-safety-glasses-and-purple-gloves-holds-a-long-pointed-device-up-to-a-petri-dish-with-a-translucent.jpg?id=61716661&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Endolith researchers use machine learning to determine which microbes to deploy at a given site and how to adjust the mix over time. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dynamic Tech Media/Endolith</small></p><p>In contrast, our \u201cmicrobial minions\u201d work by accelerating the natural process of <a href=\"https://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/innovations/2004/05/producing_copper_natures_way_bioleaching.html\" target=\"_blank\">bioleaching</a>. Instead of relying on smelting or harsh acids, Endolith\u2019s microbes attach to the ore and pull out the copper faster. They adapt to the chemistry of different rock types, recover more metal, and do it with lower energy use and less environmental impact.</p><p>To make this possible, we rely on machine learning. Genomic and metabolic data from thousands of microbes are modeled to predict which strains can survive in extreme ores such as chalcopyrite or enargite, and how they will perform under different environmental conditions. These models guide which microbial communities are deployed, how they are tuned for each site, and how they adapt over time. In effect, AI is what turns biology from trial-and-error into a scalable system for copper recovery; in turn, that copper is what keeps powering the growth of AI itself.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An overhead shot shows two workers in lab coats and hard hats pointing up at a series of tall columns sheathed in foil\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"98b46\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-overhead-shot-shows-two-workers-in-lab-coats-and-hard-hats-pointing-up-at-a-series-of-tall-columns-sheathed-in-foil.jpg?id=61716658&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Endolith is currently running a pilot project in Arvada, Colorado.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dynamic Tech Media/Endolith</small></p><p>Our approach has already been validated by some of the largest copper producers in the world, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/press-releases/endolith-achieves-breakthrough-in-critical-mineral-extraction-2025-05-13/\" target=\"_blank\">including BHP</a>. Microbial recovery is cleaner. It scales. It adapts. Our modular biohatcheries\u2014field units designed to grow and deliver tailored microbes\u2014can be deployed in days. They can be tuned for local conditions. They make copper recovery viable on deposits that were previously left untouched. This tool opens access to a part of the supply chain that mining has overlooked and technology has rarely considered.</p><h2>The copper crunch is slowing down AI</h2><p>Conversations about AI infrastructure rarely address this layer. Computing costs and energy needs dominate the narrative, yet copper underpins the entire system.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman in a lab coat, with colorfully died hair holds up a beaker full of small pellets in front of processing equipment.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"78934\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-in-a-lab-coat-with-colorfully-died-hair-holds-up-a-beaker-full-of-small-pellets-in-front-of-processing-equipment.jpg?id=61716659&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Liz Dennett founded Endolith to recover much-needed copper from low-grade ore. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dynamic Tech Media/Endolith</small></p><p>The physical side of AI is often hidden from view. Its presence becomes obvious when a data center project is delayed because a transformer cannot be delivered on time, or when utilities cannot build transmission lines quickly enough to support new computing loads. These are copper problems, hiding in plain sight.</p><p>I have had calls with site engineers who are excited about deploying cutting-edge computing, but are quietly worried about whether the wiring can handle it. Infrastructure does not automatically follow because the software is ready. Copper is bound by geology and time. Mines move slowly, recycling moves too narrowly, and demand moves too fast. Smarter biological recovery is the lever we can pull today.</p><p><span>Skeptics note that bioleaching has historically struggled with tough ores like <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892687523004314\" target=\"_blank\">chalcopyrite</a>. Processes were often slow, incomplete, or difficult to manage at scale. Recent advances in microbial science and heap engineering are closing those gaps. With AI guiding the optimization of microbes, we can now match the right strains to the right ores, showing that biology can succeed where older methods fell short.</span></p><p>Too often, technology assumes the material world will keep pace with ambition. But ambition alone cannot dig rock from the ground\u2014and it definitely cannot create copper. I see a disconnect between belief and infrastructure. We believe this future is coming, but the physical systems required to support it are decades behind. If we want to build something durable, we need more than ambition and venture capital. We need metal, and we need smarter pathways to extract it.</p><p>If we want to keep building, we need to be clear about what we are building with. That means extraction, wiring, and chemistry\u2014the parts of the system that rarely make headlines but determine whether progress is possible.</p><p>The AI era will not be sustained by excitement. It will be sustained by copper. And the next leap in recovery may come from microbes\u2026tiny, ancient, and alive.</p>"
