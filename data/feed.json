        "summary": "This chapter presents a tractable framework for the study of technology adoption and diffusion in the context of economic development. Firms in countries behind the world technology frontier can rapidly adopt new techniques from the world frontier. Lower absorptive capacity (because of weak education systems, poor management practices, or barriers to technology adoption), institutional distortions, mismatch between frontier technologies and the needs of firms in the country (i.e., \u201cinappropriate technology\u201d), and credit market frictions slow down technology adoption and cause the economy in question to have a greater distance to the frontier and thus lower income per capita\u2014although the long-run growth rate of the country still remains equal to that of the frontier. This framework is extended to study the choice between innovation and imitation, as well as the role of selection for higher-productivity and higher-absorptive capacity firms during the process of economic development. We illustrate the main comparative statics of our framework with a number of correlations based on cross-country and firm-level data. The tractability of the framework makes it amenable to a range of additional extensions."

        "summary": "AI technology can generate speculative-growth equilibria. These are rational but fragile: elevated valuations support rapid capital accumulation, yet persist only as long as beliefs remain coordinated. Because AI capital is labor-like, it expands effective labor and dampens the normal decline in the marginal product of capital as the capital stock grows. The gains from this expansion accrue disproportionately to capitalists, whose saving rate rises with wealth, raising aggregate saving.  Building on Caballero et al (2006), I show that these features generate a funding feedback\u2014rising capitalist wealth lowers the required return\u2014that can produce multiple equilibria. With intermediate adjustment costs, elevated valuations are the mechanism that sustains a transition toward a high-capital equilibrium; a loss of confidence can precipitate a self-fulfilling crash and reversal."

        "summary": "We document that migration flows upon retirement are predominantly from richer, more urban to poorer, more rural regions. In theory, the local economic implications of senior in-migration are ambiguous, while empirically there is little existing evidence on whether attracting mobile seniors can be an effective tool to promote economic development among lagging regions. We combine a unique collection of microdata from France with a new empirical strategy to fill this gap. We find that senior inflows have significant positive effects on the local economy over the course of a decade, including increases in the working-age population, total employment, GDP, average incomes, fiscal revenues and housing construction. These effects are particularly pronounced among initially poorer regions. They are accompanied by an increase in the share of services in the local economy, driven by employment growth in health, food services and retail sectors. Combining these estimates with observed region-to-region net migration flows, we find that mobile seniors have become a significant force for reducing the concentration of employment and GDP across regions."

        "summary": "Gender and racial/ethnic gaps in labor market earnings remain large, even among college-goers. Cross-gender and race/ethnic differences in choice of and returns to college major are potentially important contributors. Following Texas public high school graduates for up to 20 years through college and the labor market, we assess gender and racial differences in college major choices and the consequences of these choices. Women and underrepresented minorities are less likely than men, Whites, and Asians to major in high earning fields like business, economics, engineering, and computer science, however we also show that they experience lower returns to these majors. Differences in major-specific returns relative to liberal arts explain about one quarter of the gender, White-Black, and White-Hispanic (but not White-Asian) earnings gaps among four-year college students and become larger contributors to earnings gaps than differential major distributions as workers age. We present suggestive evidence that differences in occupation choices within field are a key driver of the differences in returns across groups. The work shines light on the roles that college major choice and returns by gender and race contribute to inequality."

        "summary": "Economic development relies on and transforms the environment. The transformation is evident in the poor environmental quality in many developing countries. For example, air quality in Southeast Asia is three times worse than in the United States, in sub-Saharan Africa four times worse and in South Asia more than six times worse. We model how environmental quality affects health, productivity and well-being and how individuals privately adapt to environmental hazards. We also model how collective action and formal regulation contribute to environmental quality. We draw three main findings from a review of empirical research on these mechanisms. First, individual adaptation to environmental hazards is both inadequate as a remedy and inefficiently low. Second, collective action, without the state, to manage resources or address externalities has been outstripped by the scale of environmental problems. Third, state action through formal regulation works better than it looks. Many formal regulations are coarse, poorly targeted and inefficient, but nonetheless yield benefits in excess of their costs."

        "summary": "This paper studies how college major choices shape earnings and fertility outcomes. Using administrative data that link students' preferences, random assignment to majors, and post-college outcomes, we estimate the causal pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns to different fields of study. We document substantial heterogeneity in these returns across majors and show that such variation helps explain gender gaps in labor market outcomes: women place greater weight on balancing career and family in their major choices, and these preference differences account for about 30% of the gender earnings gap among college graduates. Last, we use our causal estimates to evaluate the effects of counterfactual assignment rules that target representation gaps in settings with centralized assignment systems. We find that gender quotas in high-return fields can significantly reduce representation and earnings gaps with minimal impacts on efficiency and aggregate fertility."

        "summary": "Does industrial activity drive deforestation and land degradation, and can limited state capacity be overcome to decouple economic growth from environmental harm? We examine these questions in the context of slaughterhouse plant openings in Brazil from 1994 to 2019. Guided by a simple conceptual framework and using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that plant openings increase livestock production while reducing forest cover and degrading pastureland. However, following the introduction of legally enforceable, incentive-compatible agreements between slaughterhouses and federal prosecutors\u2014which penalize purchases of livestock from illegally deforested areas but act as a green certification mechanism\u2014plant openings increase productivity without driving deforestation. Our findings suggest that tying firm performance to environmental goals through market-aligned legal mechanisms can generate economic and environmental gains at low cost to the government."

IEEE Senior Member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/senakizildemir/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sena Kizildemir</a> is changing that through disaster simulation, one scenario at a time.</p><h3>Sena Kizildemir</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer</strong></p><p>Thornton Tomasetti, in New York City</p><p><strong>Job title</strong></p><p>Project engineer</p><p><strong>Member grade </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Senior member</p><p><strong>Alma maters </strong></p><p>I\u015fik University in \u015eile and Lehigh University, in Bethlehem, Pa.</p><p>A project engineer at <a href=\"https://www.thorntontomasetti.com/resource/applied-science-practice\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thornton Tomasetti</a>\u2019s applied science division in New York, Kizildemir uses simulations to study how buildings fail under extreme events such as impacts and explosions. The simulation results can help designers develop mitigation strategies.</p><p>\u201cSimulations help us understand what could happen before it occurs in real life,\u201d she says, \u201cto be able to better plan for it.\u201d</p><p>She loves that her work mixes creativity with solving real-world problems, she says: \u201cYou\u2019re creating something to help people. My favorite question to answer is, \u2018Can you make this better or easier?\u2019\u201d</p><p>For her work, the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.pwc-ny.org/about-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Women in Construction</a> named her one of its <a href=\"https://members.pwc-ny.org/events/Details/holiday-party-2025-1496059?sourceTypeId=Hub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 Under 40: Women in Construction</a> for 2025.</p><p>Kizildemir is passionate about <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_blank\">mentoring young engineers</a> and being an IEEE volunteer. She says she has made it her mission to \u201cpack as much impact into my years as possible.\u201d</p><h2>A bright student in T\u00fcrkiye</h2><p>She was born in Istanbul to a father who is a professional drummer and a mother who worked in magazine advertising and sales. Kizildemir and her older brother pursued engineering careers despite neither parent being involved in the field. While she became an expert in civil and mechanical engineering, her brother is an industrial engineer.</p><p>As a child, she was full of curiosity, she says, interested in figuring out how things were built and how they worked. She loved building objects out of <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Legos</a>, she says, and one of her earliest memories is using them to make miniature houses for ants.</p><p>After acing an entrance exam, she won a spot in a STEM-focused high school, where she studied mathematics and physics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cEngineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.\u201d</span></p><p><span></span>During her final year at the high school, she took the nationwide <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Selection_and_Placement_System\" target=\"_blank\">YKS</a> (Higher Education Foundations Examination). The test determines which universities and programs\u2014such as medicine, engineering, or law\u2014students can pursue.</p><p>She received a full scholarship to attend <a href=\"https://www.isikun.edu.tr/en\" target=\"_blank\">I\u015fik University</a> in \u015eile. Figuring she would study engineering abroad one day, she chose an English-taught program. She says she found that civil engineering best aligned with making the biggest impact on her community and the world.</p><p>Several of her professors were alumni of <a href=\"https://www2.lehigh.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Lehigh University</a>, in Bethlehem, Pa., and spoke highly of the school. After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2016, she decided to attend Lehigh, where she earned a full scholarship to its master\u2019s program in civil engineering.</p><h2>Moving abroad and working the rails</h2><p>Her master\u2019s thesis focused on investigating root causes of crack propagation, which threatens railroad safety.</p><p>Repeated wheel-rail loading causes microcracks, leading to metal fatigue, and residual stress results from specialized heating and cooling treatments during the manufacturing of steel rails. Cracks can develop beneath the rail\u2019s surface. Because they\u2019re invisible to the naked eye, such fractures are challenging to detect, Kizildemir says.</p><p>The project was done in collaboration with the U.S. <a href=\"https://railroads.dot.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Railroad Administration</a>\u2014part of the <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Transportation</a>\u2014which is looking to adjust technical standards and employ mitigation strategies.</p><p>Kizildemir and five colleagues designed and implemented testing protocols and physics-based simulations to detect cracks earlier and prevent their spread. Their research has given the Railroad Administration insights into structural defects that are being used to revise rail-building guidelines and inspection protocols. The administration published the <a href=\"https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/76534\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first phase</a> of the research in 2024.</p><p>After graduating in 2018, Kizildemir began a summer internship as a civil engineer at Thornton Tomasetti. She conducted computational modeling using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abaqus</a> software for rails subjected to repeated plastic deformation\u2014material that permanently changes shape when under excessive stress\u2014and presented her recommendations for improvement to the company\u2019s management.</p><p>During her internship, she worked with professors in different fields, including materials behavior and mechanical engineering. The experience, she says, inspired her to pursue a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh, continuing her research with the Railroad Administration. She earned her degree in 2023.</p><p>She loved the work and the team at Thornton Tomasetti so much, she says, that she applied to work at the company, where she is now a project engineer.</p><h2>From simulations to real-world applications</h2><p>Her work focuses on developing finite element models for critical infrastructure and extreme events.</p><p>Finite modeling breaks complex systems or topics into small elements connected together to numerically simulate real-world situations. She creates computational models of structures enduring realistic catastrophic events, such as a vehicle crashing into a building.</p><p>She uses simulations to understand how buildings react to attacks such as the one on 9/11, which, she says, is often used as an example of why such research is essential.</p><p>When starting a project, she and her team review building standards and try to identify new issues not yet covered by them. The team then adapts existing codes and standards, usually developed for well-understood hazards such as earthquakes, wind, and floods, to define simulation parameters.</p><p>When a new structure is being built, for example, it is not designed to withstand a truck crashing into it. But Kizildemir and her team want to know how the building would react should that happen. They simulate the environments and situations, and they make recommendations based on the results to reduce or eliminate risks of structural failure.</p><p>Mitigation suggestions include specific strategies to be implemented during project design and construction.</p><p>Simulations can be created for any infrastructure, Kizildemir says.</p><p>\u201cI love problems that force me to think differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to keep growing.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to live by Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s internal motto: \u201cWhen others say no, we say \u2018Here\u2019s how.\u2019\u201d</p><h2>Joining IEEE and getting more involved</h2><p>When Kizildemir first heard of IEEE, she assumed it was only for electrical engineers. But after learning how diverse and inclusive the organization is, she joined in 2024. She has since been elevated to a senior member and has become a volunteer. She joined the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMTEM014\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society</a>.</p><p>She chaired the conference tracks and IEEE-sponsored sessions at the 2024 <a href=\"https://event.asme.org/Joint-Rail-Conference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Rail Conference</a>, held in Columbia, S.C. She actively contributes to IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Collabratec platform</a> and has participated in panel review meetings for senior member elevation applications.</p><p>She\u2019s also a member of <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASME</a> and has been volunteering for it since 2023.</p><p>\u201cCommunity is what helped get me to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward and make the field better,\u201d she says. \u201cHelping others improves ourselves.\u201d</p><h2>Looking ahead and giving back</h2><p>Kizildemir mentors junior engineers at Thornton Thomasetti and is looking to expand her reach through <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/mentoring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE\u2019s mentorship programs</a>.</p><p>\u201cEngineering doesn\u2019t have a gender requirement,\u201d she says she tells girls. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious and like understanding how things work and get excited to solve difficult problems, engineering is for you.</p><p>\u201cCivil engineers don\u2019t just build bridges,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere are countless niche areas to be explored. Engineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.\u201d</p><p>Kizildemir says she wants every engineer to be able to improve their community. Her main piece of advice for recent engineering graduates is that \u201ccuriosity, discipline, and the willingness to understand things deeply, to see how things can be done better,\u201d are the keys to success.</p>"

In districts such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhemaji\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dhemaji</a>, Assam, and the rural areas of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharagpur\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kharagpur</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">West Bengal</a>, learning STEM often is just a distant dream.</p><p>I grew up in rural areas, and I saw how curiosity for science collided with poverty. Many students\u2019 futures rely entirely on getting good grades to determine whether they are \u201cworthy\u201d of studying technical subjects later. One low grade on an exam can completely derail their future. More importantly, the absence of fully equipped laboratories, trained mentors, or exposure to STEM careers prevents many children from even being able to imagine an engineering career.</p><p>This is not just an educational issue. It is a matter of equity, directly aligned with <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 4</a>, which aims to ensure a quality education for everyone.</p><p>The challenge is one that organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a>, with its global technical community, are positioned to address. As technology becomes more imperative for everyday life, proficiency in electronics and programming is no longer optional\u2014it is essential.</p><h2>STEM outreach programs</h2><p>In December 2020 volunteers from the joint student chapter of the <a href=\"https://edu.ieee.org/in-iitkgp-mtt/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Antennas and Propagation\u2013Microwave Theory and Techniques</a> (IEEE AP-MTT) societies at the <a href=\"https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a> launched a grassroots STEM outreach <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9423752\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initiative</a> with support from the <a href=\"https://ieeekharagpur.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Kharagpur Section</a>.</p><p>I coordinated the initiative, which started when I was secretary of the student chapter. (I also was its vice chair and chair from 2020 to 2022.) Today I am a student ambassador for the IEEE MTT Society and the <a href=\"https://yp.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Young Professionals</a> cochair of the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ieee-benelux-mtt-ap-joint-chapter/?originalSubdomain=nl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Benelux MTT-AP joint chapter</a>.</p><p>The program\u2019s mission was simple: make hands-on electronics accessible to students who had never seen an <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Arduino</a> board.</p><p>It began with training in the fundamentals of circuit building\u2014LEDs, switches, breadboards, and batteries\u2014and progressed into Arduino programming, automation, and sensor integration. The volunteers emphasized teamwork and friendly competitions to keep students engaged.</p><p>Through straightforward, relatable demonstrations, even complex topics such as electromagnetic concepts were explained in ways that the students could understand. The methodology not only increased understanding; it also sparked enthusiasm. In the first year, nearly 100 students from five schools benefited from the curriculum. The model is now known as Teach, Train, and Build (TTB). The initiative was recognized in 2021 with the <a href=\"https://students.ieee.org/the-darrel-chong-student-activity-award/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Darrel Chong Student Activity Award</a>.</p><h2>The birth of hobby clubs</h2><p>TTB\u2019s success led to additional funding from the <a href=\"https://sight.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Special Interest Group in Humanitarian Technology</a> (SIGHT) program in 2022<strong>. </strong>This support from IEEE SIGHT enabled the establishment of<strong> </strong>three electronics hobby labs in underserved schools in Assam and West Bengal. The E-HuTS (electronic hobby clubs for technical development in rural schools) labs became permanent areas where students learn, experiment, and innovate.</p><p>The inauguration ceremony for the E-HuTS was a milestone moment. To further inspire students, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrinal-mandal-96a97137/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mrinal Mandal</a>, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at IIT Kharagpur, gave a motivational talk in Bengali. The immediate outcome was that a group of students built a smart home using Arduino and wireless communication modules\u2014something they never imagined they could do.</p><h2>Reducing gender disparity</h2><p>A similar transformation unfolded in Assam, where the TTB program was conducted entirely in the Assamese language, ensuring inclusivity for students with limited exposure to English. After completing the program, students proudly displayed their IEEE certificates.</p><p>One of the best aspects of the Assam program was the overwhelming participation of female students. Many of the young women were interacting with electronics for the first time\u2014an inspiring step toward reducing gender disparity in the STEM field.</p><h2>Real impact: projects, confidence, and recognition</h2><p>The more than 85 students who joined the hobby clubs in Assam and West Bengal developed almost three dozen projects including sensor-based alarms and environmental monitoring systems. The innovations weren\u2019t replicas; they were original student-driven designs developed under the guidance of an IEEE mentor.</p><p>The initiative received a mention in the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/corporate-communications/annual-report/2022/2022-ieee-annual-final-print-version.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2022 IEEE annual report</a> and in an article in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>The Institute</em></em></a> about<strong> </strong>the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-education-week-2022-overview\" target=\"_self\">2022<strong> </strong>IEEE Education Week</a> activities.</p><p>To ensure measurable progress of the program, the TTB team also implemented an evaluation matrix inspired by <a href=\"https://ieeeht.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Humanitarian Technologies Board</a> guidelines. The spreadsheet tracked outputs including the number of workshops held, hours delivered, and tools provided. It also measured results such as skills development, knowledge retention, student engagement, and long-term interest.</p><p>The structured methodology made the project replicable and transparent, providing a framework for future STEM outreach efforts.</p><h2>New chapters, new beginnings</h2><p>The momentum from those initiatives helped spark the creation of IEEE communities in India. In 2023 the IEEE student branch at <a href=\"https://dibru.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dibrugarh University</a> in Assam was formed, followed in 2024 by the university\u2019s <a href=\"https://edu.ieee.org/in-dibru/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Microwave Theory and Technology Society student branch chapter</a>. The groups have become centers of volunteer activity, ensuring long-term sustainability.</p><p>This year the TTB team organized<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGStCkIT2Tn/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TechnoFest: Udhvav 2.0</a><strong>,</strong> which brought engineers, scientists, lecturers, and members of the <a href=\"https://yp.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Young Professionals</a> group together with students in the region. For many participants, it was their first opportunity to interact with real innovators and role models, turning the festival into an energizing platform of inspiration and exposure for rural youth.</p><h2>A visit to Vidhya: The Living School</h2><p>Also in 2023, thanks to a grant from the <a href=\"https://mtt.org/ieee-mtt-s-ambassador-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE MTT-S Ambassador</a> program, IEEE volunteers visited <a href=\"https://vidyalivingschool.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vidhya: The Living School</a>, in Dhemaji.

Instead of speakers, the Project G had sound globes.

As one writer later put it, it was more like a concept car \u201cintended to give Clairtone an aura of futuristic cool.\u201d Eventually fewer than 500 were made. But the Project G still became an icon of mod \u201960s Canadian design, winning a silver medal at the 13th Milan Triennale, the international design exhibition.</p><p>And then it was over; the dream had ended. Eleven years after its founding, Clairtone collapsed, and Munk and cofounder David Gilmour lost control of the company.</p><h2>The birth of Clairtone Sound Corp.</h2><p>Clairtone\u2019s Peter Munk lived a colorful life, with a nightmarish start and many fantastic and dreamlike parts too. He was born in 1927 in Budapest to a prosperous Jewish family. In the spring of 1944, Munk and 13 members of his family boarded a train with more than 1,600 Jews bound for the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. They arrived, but after some weeks the train moved on, eventually reaching neutral Switzerland. It later emerged that the Nazis had extorted large sums of cash and valuables from the occupants in exchange for letting the train proceed.</p><p>As a teenager in Switzerland, Munk was a self-described party animal. He enjoyed dancing and dating and going on long ski trips with friends. Schoolwork was not a top priority, and he didn\u2019t have the grades to attend a Swiss university. His mother, an Auschwitz survivor, encouraged him to study in Canada, where he had an uncle.</p><p>Before he could enroll, though, Munk blew his tuition money entertaining a young woman during a trip to New York. He then found work picking tobacco, earned enough for tuition, and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1952 with a degree in electrical engineering.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of two men in office attire. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1c5ae\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-two-men-in-office-attire.jpg?id=62980489&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Clairtone cofounders Peter Munk [left] and David Gilmour envisioned the company as a luxury brand.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nina Munk/The Peter Munk Estate</small></p><p>At the age of 30, Munk was making custom hi-fi sets for wealthy clients when he and David Gilmour, who owned a small business importing Scandinavian goods, decided to join forces. Their idea was to create high-fidelity equipment with a contemporary Scandinavian design. Munk\u2019s father-in-law, William Jay Gutterson, invested $3,000. Gilmour mortgaged his house. In 1958, Clairtone Sound Corp. was born. </p><p>From the beginning, Munk and Gilmour sought a high-end clientele. They positioned Clairtone as a luxury brand, part of an elegant lifestyle. If you were the type of woman who listened to music while wearing pearls and a strapless gown and lounging on a shag rug, your music would be playing on a Clairtone. If you were a man who dressed smartly and owned an <a href=\"https://arnejacobsen.com/works/the-egg-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Arne Jacobsen Egg chair</a>, you would also be listening on a Clairtone. That was the modern lifestyle captured in the company\u2019s advertisements. </p><p>In 1958, Clairtone produced its first prototype: the monophonic 100-M, which had a long, low cabinet made from oiled teak, with a Dual 1004 turntable, a Granco tube chassis, and a pair of Coral speakers. It never went into production, but the next model, the stereophonic 100-S, won a Design Award from Canada\u2019s National Industrial Design Council in 1959. By 1963, Clairtone was selling 25,000 units a year.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a line of stereo components under assembly, with a man in a lab coat at one end and a man in a suit at the other.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"90768\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-line-of-stereo-components-under-assembly-with-a-man-in-a-lab-coat-at-one-end-and-a-man-in-a-suit-at.jpg?id=62981917&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Peter Munk visits the Project G assembly line in 1965. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nina Munk/The Peter Munk Estate</small></p><p>Design was always front and center at Clairtone, not just for the products but also for the typography, advertisements, and even the annual reports. Yet nothing in the early designs signaled the dramatic turn it would take with the Project G. That came about because of Hugh Spencer.</p><p>Spencer was not an engineer, nor did he have experience designing consumer electronics. His day job was designing sets for the <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Broadcast Corp.</a> He consulted regularly with Clairtone on the company\u2019s graphics and signage. The only stereo he ever designed for Clairtone was the Project G, which he first modeled as a wooden box with tennis balls stuck to the sides. </p><p>From both design and quality perspectives, Clairtone was successful. But the company was almost always hemorrhaging cash. In 1966, with great fanfare and large government incentives, the company opened a state-of-the-art production facility in Nova Scotia. It was a mismatch. The local workforce didn\u2019t have the necessary skills, and the surrounding infrastructure couldn\u2019t handle the production. On 27 August 1967, Munk and Gilmour were forced out of Clairtone, which became the property of the government of Nova Scotia.</p><p>Despite the demise of their first company (and the government inquiry that followed), Munk and Gilmour remained friends and went on to become serial entrepreneurs. Their next venture? A resort in Fiji, which became part of a large hotel chain in that country, Australia, and New Zealand. (Gilmour later founded <a href=\"https://www.fijiwater.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fiji Water</a>.) Then Munk and Gilmour bought a gold mine and cofounded Barrick Gold (now <a href=\"https://www.barrick.com/English/home/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Barrick Mining Corp.</a>, one of the largest gold mining operations in the world). Their businesses all had ups and downs, but both men became extremely wealthy and noted philanthropists.</p><h2>Preserving Canadian design</h2><p>As an example of iconic design, the Project G seems like an ideal specimen for museum collections. And in 1991, Frank Davies, one of the designers who worked for Clairtone, donated a Project G to the recently launched Design Exchange in Toronto. It would be the first object in the DX\u2019s permanent collection, which sought to preserve examples of Canadian design. The museum quickly became Canada\u2019s center for the promotion of design, hosting more than 50 programs each year to teach people about how design influences every aspect of our lives. </p><p>In 2008, the museum opened <em><em>The Art of Clairtone: The Making of a Design Icon, 1958\u20131971, </em></em>an exhibition showcasing the company\u2019s distinctive graphic design, industrial design, engineering, and photography.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a modern stereo system in the foreground and a woman sitting in a modern arm chair in the back. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"24fd8\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-modern-stereo-system-in-the-foreground-and-a-woman-sitting-in-a-modern-arm-chair-in-the-back.jpg?id=62988475&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">David Gilmour\u2019s wife, Anna Gilmour, was the company\u2019s first in-house model.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nina Munk/The Peter Munk Estate</small></p><p>But what happened to the DX itself is a reminder that any museum, however worthy, shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted. In 2019, the DX abruptly closed its permanent collection, and curators were charged with deaccessioning its objects. Fortunately, the <a href=\"https://www.rom.on.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Ontario Museum</a>, <a href=\"https://carleton.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Carleton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.yorku.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">York</a> Universities, and the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Archives of Ontario</a>, among others, were able to accept the artifacts and companion archives. (The <a href=\"https://collections.rom.on.ca/objects/2476799/project-g-stereo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Project G</a> pictured at top is now at the Royal Ontario Museum.) </p><p>Researchers at York and Carleton have been working to digitize and virtually reconstitute the DX collection, through the <a href=\"https://rs.lincsproject.ca/resource/search:xdx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">xDX Project</a>. They\u2019re using the Linked Infrastructure for Networked Cultural Scholarship (LINCS) to turn interlinked and contextualized data about the collection into a searchable database. It\u2019s a worthy goal, even if it\u2019s not quite the same as having all of the artifacts and supporting papers physically together in one place. I admit to feeling both pleased about this virtual workaround, and also a little sad that a unified collection that once spoke to the historical significance of Canadian design no longer exists.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the February 2026 print issue as \u201cThe Project G Stereo Defined 1960s Cool.\u201d</em></em></p><h3>References\u00a0</h3><br /><p>I first learned about Clairtone\u2019s Project G from a panel on Canada\u2019s design heritage organized by York University historian Jan Hadlaw at the 2025 annual meeting of the Society for the History of Technology.</p><p><a href=\"https://ninamunk.com/books-cpt/the-art-of-clairtone/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Art of Clairtone: The Making of a Design Icon, 1958\u20131971</em></a> by Nina Munk (Peter Munk\u2019s daughter) and Rachel Gotlieb (McClelland & Stewart, 2008) was the companion book to the <a href=\"https://hamblywoolley.com/work/the-design-exchange-clairtone-exhibit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition</a> of the same name hosted by the Design Exchange in Toronto.

Their current answer: 5.5 days. </p><p>The CRASH Clock metric was introduced in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09643\" target=\"_blank\">paper originally published on the Arxiv physics preprint server</a> in December and is currently under consideration for publication. The team\u2019s research measures how quickly a catastrophic collision could occur if satellite operators lost the ability to maneuver\u2014whether due to a solar storm, a software failure, or some other catastrophic failure.</p><p>To be clear, say the CRASH Clock scientists, low Earth orbit is not about to become a new unstable realm of collisions. But what the researchers have shown, consistent with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/kessler-syndrome-space-debris\" target=\"_blank\">recent research and public outcry</a>, is that low Earth orbit\u2019s current stability demands perfect decisions on the part of a range of satellite operators around the globe every day. A few mistakes at the wrong time and place in orbit could set a lot of chaos in motion.</p><p>But the biggest hidden threat isn\u2019t always debris that can be seen from the ground or via radar imaging systems. <span>Rather, thousands of small pieces of junk that are still big enough to disrupt a satellite\u2019s operations are what satellite operators have nightmares about these days</span><span>.

We\u2019re not making any claim about this being a runaway collisional cascade. We only look at the timescale to the first collision\u2014we don\u2019t simulate secondary or tertiary collisions. The CRASH Clock reflects how reliant we are on errorless operations and is an indicator for stress on the orbital environment.</p><p><strong>Aaron Boley:</strong> A lot of people\u2019s mental vision of Kessler syndrome is this very rapid runaway, and in reality this is something that can take decades to truly build.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> <a href=\"https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/sdc9/paper/305/SDC9-paper305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recent papers</a> found that altitudes between 520 and 1,000 kilometers have already reached this potential runaway threshold. Even in that case, the timescales for how slowly this happens are very long. It\u2019s more about whether you have a significant number of objects at a given altitude such that controlling the proliferation of debris becomes difficult.</p><h2>Understanding the CRASH Clock\u2019s Implications</h2><p><strong>What does the CRASH Clock approaching zero actually mean?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> The CRASH Clock assumes no maneuvers can happen\u2014a worst-case scenario where some catastrophic event like a solar storm has occurred. A zero value would mean if you lose maneuvering capabilities, you\u2019re likely to have a collision right away. It\u2019s possible to reach saturation where any maneuver triggers another maneuver, and you have this endless swarm of maneuvers where dodging doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.</p><p><strong>Boley:</strong> I think about the CRASH Clock as an evaluation of stress on orbit. As you approach zero, there\u2019s very little tolerance for error. If you have an accidental explosion\u2014whether a battery exploded or debris slammed into a satellite\u2014the risk of knock-on effects is amplified. It doesn\u2019t mean a runaway, but you can have consequences that are still operationally bad. It means much higher costs\u2014both economic and environmental\u2014because companies have to replace satellites more often. Greater launches, more satellites going up and coming down. The orbital congestion, the atmospheric pollution, all of that gets amplified.</p><p><strong>Are working satellites becoming a bigger danger to each other than debris?</strong></p><p><strong>Boley:</strong> The biggest risk on orbit is the lethal non-trackable debris\u2014this middle region where you can\u2019t track it, it won\u2019t cause an explosion, but it can disable the spacecraft if hit. This population is very large compared with what we actually track. We often talk about Kessler syndrome in terms of number density, but really what\u2019s also important is the collisional area on orbit. As you increase the area through the number of active satellites, you increase the probability of interacting with smaller debris.</p><p><strong>Samantha Lawler:</strong> <a href=\"https://starlink.com/public-files/starlinkProgressReport_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink just released a conjunction report</a>\u2014they\u2019re doing one collision avoidance maneuver every two minutes on average in their megaconstellation. </p><p><strong>The orbit at 550 km altitude, in particular, is densely packed with Starlink satellites. Is that right?</strong></p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> The way Starlink has occupied 550 km and filled it to very high density means anybody who wants to use a higher-altitude orbit has to get through that really dense shell. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-internet\" target=\"_blank\">China\u2019s megaconstellations</a> are all at higher altitudes, so they have to go through Starlink. A couple of weeks ago, there was a <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/satellites/spacecraft-from-chinese-launch-nearly-slammed-into-starlink-satellite-spacex-says\" target=\"_blank\">headline</a> about a Starlink satellite almost hitting a Chinese rocket. These problems are happening now. Starlink <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/starlink-plans-lower-satellite-orbit-enhance-safety-2026-2026-01-01/\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a> they\u2019re moving down to 350 km, shifting satellites to even lower orbits. Really, everybody has to go through them\u2014including ISS, including astronauts.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> 550 km has the highest density of active payloads. There are other orbits of concern around 800 km\u2014the altitude of the [2007] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese anti-satellite missile test</a> and the [2009] <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100002023\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos-Iridium collision</a>. Above 600 km, atmospheric drag takes a very long time to bring objects down. Below 600 km, drag acts as a natural cleaning mechanism. In that 800 km to 900 km band, there\u2019s a lot of debris that\u2019s going to be there for centuries.</p><h2>Impact of Collisions at 550 Kilometers</h2><p><strong>What happens if there\u2019s a collision at 550 km? Would that orbit become unusable?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> No, it would not become unusable\u2014not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(2013_film)#Technical_observations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gravity</em> movie scenario</a>. Any catastrophic collision is an acute injection of debris. You would still be able to use that altitude, but your operating conditions change. You\u2019re going to do a lot more collision-avoidance maneuvers. Because it\u2019s below 600 km, that debris will come down within a handful of years. But in the meantime, you\u2019re dealing with a lot more danger, especially because that\u2019s the altitude with the highest density of Starlink satellites.</p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> I don\u2019t know how quickly Starlink can respond to new debris injections. It takes days or weeks for debris to be tracked, cataloged, and made public. I hope Starlink has access to faster services, because in the meantime that\u2019s an awful lot of risk.</p><p><strong>How do solar storms affect orbital safety?</strong></p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> Solar storms make the atmosphere puff up\u2014high-energy particles smashing into the atmosphere. Drag can change very quickly. During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms\" target=\"_blank\">May 2024 solar storm</a>, orbital uncertainties were kilometers. With things traveling 7 kilometers per second, that\u2019s terrifying. Everything is maneuvering at the same time, which adds uncertainty. You want to have margin for error, time to recover after an event that changes many orbits. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-noaa-sun-reaches-maximum-phase-in-11-year-solar-cycle/\" target=\"_blank\">We\u2019ve come off solar maximum</a>, but over the next couple of years it\u2019s very likely we\u2019ll have more really powerful solar storms.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> The risk for collision within the first few days of a solar storm is a lot higher than under normal operating conditions. Even if you can still communicate with your satellite, there\u2019s so much uncertainty in your positions when everything is moving because of atmospheric drag. When you have high density of objects, it makes the likelihood of collision a lot more prominent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graph: collision chance vs. days.

Can you explain the revision?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> We updated based on community feedback, which was excellent. The newer numbers are 164 days for 2018 and 5.5 days for 2025. The paper is submitted and will hopefully go through peer review.</p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> It\u2019s been a very interesting process putting this on Arxiv and receiving community feedback.

All these different stakeholders use space for different reasons, so work that has an interdisciplinary connection can get conversations started between these different domains.</p>"

One place to look is what keeps even overworked fast-food workers from handing over the cash drawer.</span></p><h2>Human Judgment Depends on Context</h2><p><span>Our basic human defenses come in at least three types: general instincts, social learning, and situation-specific training. These work together in a layered defense.</span></p><p><span>As a social species, we have developed numerous instinctive and cultural habits that help us judge tone, motive, and risk from extremely limited information. We generally know what\u2019s normal and abnormal, when to cooperate and when to resist, and whether to take action individually or to involve others. These instincts give us an intuitive sense of risk and make us </span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08242\" target=\"_blank\"><span>especially careful</span></a> about things that have a large downside or are impossible to reverse.</p><p><span>The second layer of defense consists of the norms and trust signals that evolve in any group. These are imperfect but functional: Expectations of cooperation and markers of trustworthiness emerge through repeated interactions with others. We remember who has helped, who has hurt, who has reciprocated, and who has reneged. And emotions like sympathy, anger, guilt, and gratitude motivate each of us to </span><a href=\"https://ncase.me/trust/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>reward cooperation with cooperation</span></a> and punish defection with defection.</p><p><span>A third layer is institutional mechanisms that enable us to interact with multiple strangers every day. Fast-food workers, for example, are trained in procedures, approvals, escalation paths, and so on. </span><span>Taken together, these defenses</span><span> give</span><span> humans a </span><span>strong sense</span><span> of context. A fast-</span><span>food worker basically knows what to expect within the</span><span> job</span><span> and</span><span> how it fits into broader society.</span></p><p><span>We reason by assessing multiple layers of context: perceptual (what we see and hear), relational (who\u2019s making the request), and normative (what\u2019s appropriate within a given role or situation). We constantly navigate these layers, weighing them against each other. In some cases, the normative outweighs the perceptual\u2014for example, following workplace rules even when customers appear angry. Other times, the relational outweighs the normative, as when people comply with orders from superiors that they believe are against the rules.</span></p><p><span>Crucially, we also have an interruption reflex. If something feels \u201coff,\u201d we naturally pause the automation and reevaluate. </span><span>Our defenses are not perfect; people are fooled and manipulated all the time. But it\u2019s how we humans are able to navigate a complex world where others are constantly trying to trick us.</span></p><p><span>So let</span><span>\u2019</span><span>s return to the drive-through window. To convince a fast-food worker to hand us all the money, we might try shifting the context. Show up with a camera crew and tell them you</span><span>\u2019</span><span>re filming a commercial, claim to be the head of security doing an audit, or dress like a bank manager collecting the cash receipts for the night. But even these have only a slim chance of success. Most of us, most of the time, can smell a scam.</span></p><p><span>Con artists are astute observers of human defenses. </span><span>Successful scams</span> are often slow, undermining a mark\u2019s situational assessment, allowing the scammer to manipulate the context. This is an old story, spanning traditional <span>confidence</span> <span>games such as the</span><span> </span>Depression-era \u201cbig store\u201d cons, in which teams of scammers created entirely fake businesses to draw in victims, and modern <a href=\"https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cpig-butchering\u201d frauds</a>, where online scammers slowly build trust before going in for the kill. In these examples, scammers slowly and methodically reel in a victim using a long series of interactions through which the scammers gradually gain that victim\u2019s trust.</p><p><span>Sometimes it even works at the drive-through. One scammer in the 1990s and 2000s </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_phone_call_scam\" target=\"_blank\">targeted fast-food workers by phone</a>, claiming to be a police officer and, over the course of a long phone call, convinced managers to strip-search employees and perform other bizarre acts.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Pixel art of a fast-food restaurant with a drive-thru, burger, cup, and trees.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1134a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/pixel-art-of-a-fast-food-restaurant-with-a-drive-thru-burger-cup-and-trees.png?id=62858711&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Humans detect scams and tricks by assessing multiple layers of context. AI systems do not. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nicholas Little</small></p><h2>Why LLMs Struggle With Context and Judgment </h2><p><span>LLMs behave as if they have a notion of context, but it\u2019s different. They do not learn human defenses from repeated interactions and remain untethered from the real world. LLMs flatten multiple levels of context into text similarity. They see \u201ctokens,\u201d not hierarchies and intentions. LLMs don\u2019t reason through context, they only reference it.</span></p><p><span>While LLMs often get the details right, they can easily miss the big picture. If you prompt a chatbot with a fast-food worker scenario and ask if it should give all of its money to a customer, it will respond \u201cno.\u201d What it doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d\u2014forgive the anthropomorphizing\u2014is whether it\u2019s actually being deployed as a fast-food bot or is just a test subject following instructions for hypothetical scenarios.</span></p><p><span>This limitation is why LLMs misfire when context is sparse but also when context is overwhelming and complex; when an LLM becomes unmoored from context, it\u2019s hard to get it back. AI expert Simon Willison </span><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/12/claude-memory/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>wipes context clean</span></a> if an LLM is on the wrong track rather than continuing the conversation and trying to correct the situation.</p><p><span>There\u2019s more. LLMs are </span><a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2025/july/trent-cash-ai-overconfidence.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>overconfident</span></a> because they\u2019ve been designed to give an answer rather than express ignorance. A drive-through worker might say: <span>\u201c</span><span>I don\u2019t know if I should give you all the money\u2014let me ask my boss,\u201d whereas an LLM will just make the call. And since LLMs are designed to be </span><a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/large-language-models-just-want-to-be-liked\" target=\"_blank\"><span>pleasing</span></a><span>, they\u2019re more likely to satisfy a user\u2019s request.</span> Additionally, LLM training is oriented toward the average case and not extreme outliers, which is what\u2019s necessary for security.</p><p><span>The result is that the current generation of LLMs is far more gullible than people. They\u2019re naive and regularly fall for manipulative </span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/these-psychological-tricks-can-get-llms-to-respond-to-forbidden-prompts/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>cognitive tricks</span></a> that wouldn\u2019t fool a third-grader, such as flattery, appeals to groupthink, and a false sense of urgency. There<span>\u2019</span><span>s a </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" target=\"_blank\"><span>story</span></a> about a Taco Bell AI system that crashed when a customer ordered 18,000 cups of water. A human fast-food worker would just laugh at the customer.</p><h2>The Limits of AI Agents</h2><p><span>Prompt injection is an unsolvable problem that </span><a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/5555/01/11194053/2aB2Rf5nZ0k\" target=\"_blank\"><span>gets worse</span></a> when we give AIs tools and tell them to act independently. This is the promise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">AI agents</a>: LLMs that can use tools to perform multistep tasks after being given general instructions. Their flattening of context and identity, along with their baked-in independence and overconfidence, mean that they will repeatedly and unpredictably take actions\u2014and sometimes they will take the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/ai_browsers_prompt_injection/\" target=\"_blank\"> wrong ones</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Science doesn\u2019t know how much of the problem is inherent to the way LLMs work and how much is a result of deficiencies in the way we train them. The overconfidence and obsequiousness of LLMs are training choices. The lack of an interruption reflex is a deficiency in engineering. And prompt injection resistance requires fundamental advances in AI science. We honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to build an LLM, where trusted commands and untrusted inputs are processed through the </span><a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/llms-data-control-path-insecurity/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>same channel</span></a><span>, which is immune to prompt injection attacks.</span></p><p><span>We humans get our model of the world\u2014and our facility with overlapping contexts\u2014from the way our brains work, years of training, an enormous amount of perceptual input, and millions of years of evolution. Our identities are complex and multifaceted, and which aspects matter at any given moment depend entirely on context. A fast-food worker may normally see someone as a customer, but in</span><span> a medical emergency, that same person\u2019s </span><span>identity as a doctor is suddenly more relevant. </span></p><p><span><span>We don</span><span>\u2019t know if LLMs will gain a better ability to move between different contexts as the models get more sophisticated. But t</span>he problem of recognizing context definitely can\u2019t be reduced to the one type of reasoning that LLMs currently excel at. Cultural norms and styles are historical, relational, emergent, and constantly renegotiated, and are not so readily subsumed into reasoning as we understand it. Knowledge itself can be both logical and discursive.</span></p><p><span>The AI researcher Yann LeCunn believes that improvements will come from embedding AIs in a physical presence and </span><span>giving</span> <span>them</span> \u201c<a href=\"https://medium.com/@AnthonyLaneau/beyond-llms-charting-the-next-frontiers-of-ai-with-yann-lecun-09e84f1978f9\" target=\"_blank\"><span>world models</span></a>.<span>\u201d Perhaps this is a way to give an AI a robust yet fluid notion of a social identity, and the real-world experience that will help it lose its na\u00efvet\u00e9.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately we are probably faced with a </span><a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/5555/01/11194053/2aB2Rf5nZ0k\" target=\"_blank\"><span>security trilemma</span></a> when it comes to AI agents: fast, smart, and secure are the desired attributes, but you can only get two. At the drive-through, you want to prioritize fast and secure. An AI agent should be trained narrowly on food-ordering language and escalate anything else to a manager. Otherwise, every action becomes a coin flip. Even if it comes up heads most of the time, once in a while it<span>\u2019</span><span>s going to be tails\u2014and along with a burger and fries, the customer will get the contents of the cash drawer.</span></p>"

It began on an overcrowded fishing boat in 1979 when he was fleeing Vietnam after the war, when survival as one of the country\u2019s \u201cboat people\u201d depended on endurance, luck, and the fragile reliability of a vessel never meant to carry so many lives. Like thousands of others, he fled from his war-torn country after the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Fall-of-Saigon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fall of Saigon</a>, which was controlled by communist North Vietnamese forces.</p><p>To mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon in 1975, Pham and his son Hoang Jr.\u2014a Rutgers computer science graduate turned filmmaker\u2014produced <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rSqNQqxkU-o?si=e3F8yW28hLfQV-a0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Unstoppable Hope</em></em></a>, a documentary about Vietnam\u2019s boat people. The film tells the stories of a dozen refugees who, like Pham, survived perilous escapes and went on to build successful lives in the United States.</p><h2>Growing up during the Vietnam War</h2><p>Pham was born in <a href=\"https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/binh-thuan-much-more-white-sand-golden-sunshine-and-blue-sea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn</a><strong>,</strong> Vietnam. His parents had only a little formal education, having grown up in the 1930s, when schooling was rare. To support their eight children, his parents ran a factory making bricks by hand. Despite their limited means, his parents held an unshakable belief that education was the surest path to a better life.</p><p>From an early age, Pham gravitated toward mathematics. Computers were scarce, but numbers and logic came naturally to him. He imagined becoming a teacher or professor and gradually began thinking about how mathematics could be applied to practical problems\u2014how abstract reasoning might improve daily life.</p><p>His intellectual curiosity unfolded amid frequent danger. He grew up during the Vietnam War, when dodging gunfire in his province was routine. The<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/tet-offensive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 1968 Tet Offensive</a> exposed the full scale of the conflict, making it clear that violence was not an interruption to life but a condition of it.</p><p>Pham recalls that after the<a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/april-30/south-vietnam-surrenders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Communist takeover of South Vietnam</a> in 1975, conditions worsened dramatically. Families without ties to the new government, especially those who operated small businesses, found it increasingly dangerous to work, study, or apply for jobs, he says. People began vanishing. Many attempted to escape by boat, knowing the risks: imprisonment if caught or potentially death at sea.</p><h2>A successful escape</h2><p>In June 1979, at the height of Vietnam\u2019s typhoon season, Pham\u2019s mother made an agonizing decision. She placed Pham, then 18 years old, onto a small, overcrowded fishing vessel in the hope that he might reach freedom.</p><p>The boat, which was designed to carry about 100 people, departed with 275.</p><p>Pham\u2019s 12-day journey was harrowing. He was confined to the lower deck, which was packed so tightly that movement was nearly impossible. Seasickness overwhelmed many passengers, and he remembers losing consciousness shortly after departure. Food was scarce, and safe drinking water was nearly nonexistent. Violent storms battered the vessel, and pirates loomed.</p><p>\u201cEvery moment felt like a struggle against nature, fate, and internal despair,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>The boat eventually washed ashore on a remote island off the Malaysian coast. Arriving at a refugee camp offered little relief; food and clean water were scarce, disease spread rapidly, and nearly everyone\u2014including Pham\u2014contracted malaria. Death came almost nightly.</p><p>After two weeks, Malaysian authorities transferred the refugees to a transit camp, where the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a> provided basic rations. Still, the asylum seekers\u2019 futures remained uncertain. It is estimated by the U.N. <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/about-unhcr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Refugee Agency</a> that between 1975 and the early 1990s, roughly 800,000 Vietnamese people attempted to escape by boat. As many as 250,000 did not survive the harrowing journey, the agency estimates.</p><h2>Starting over with nothing</h2><p>In January 1980, at age 19, Pham learned that someone in the United States had agreed to sponsor him for entry, he says. He soon boarded an airplane for the first time and landed in Seattle.</p><p>His troubles weren\u2019t over, however. He arrived in a city blanketed by snow, wearing thin clothing and carrying only a spare shirt. The frosty weather was not his greatest concern, though. During his first two months, he spent most of his time in a hospital, recovering from malaria and other diseases. And he spoke no English.</p><p>Still, Pham\u2014who had been a first-year college student in Vietnam\u2014refused to abandon his goal of becoming a teacher, he says. He enrolled at<a href=\"https://lincolnhs.seattleschools.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Lincoln High School</a> in order to gain English proficiency and position himself to enter an American college. One teacher allowed him to test into a calculus class despite his limited English\u2014which he passed.</p><p>\u201cThat moment told me I could survive here,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>Within months, he learned he could attend college on a scholarship. He moved to Chicago in August 1980 to study at the<a href=\"https://nl.edu/national-college-of-education/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> National College of Education</a>, then he transferred to<a href=\"https://www.neiu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Northeastern Illinois University</a>, also in Chicago, earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and computer science in 1982.</p><p>Encouraged by mentors, he earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics at the<a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Illinois</a> at Urbana-Champaign in 1984, followed by a Ph.D. in reliability engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.buffalo.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">State University of New York at Buffalo</a> in 1989.</p><h2>When failure is not an option</h2><p>Pham\u2019s research direction crystallized in 1988 while searching for a dissertation topic. He was reading the January 1988 issue of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"> <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a> and had a flash of inspiration after seeing a classified ad posted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Defense Department</a>\u2019s Naval Underwater System Center (now known as the <a href=\"https://tethys.pnnl.gov/organization/naval-undersea-warfare-center-nuwc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Naval Undersea Warfare Center</a>). The ad asked, \u201cCan your theories solve the unsolvable?\u201d It focused on the reliability of undersea communication and combat decision-making systems.</p><p>The ad revealed to him that institutions were actively applying mathematics and statistics to solve engineering problems. Pham says he still keeps a copy of that <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> issue in his office.</p><p>After completing his Ph.D., he joined<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing</a> as a senior specialist engineer at its Renton, Wash., facility, working on engine reliability for the<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/commercial/777\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 777</a> aircraft, which was under development.</p><p>He worked there for 18 months, then accepted a senior engineering specialist position at the<a href=\"https://inl.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Idaho National Laboratory</a>, in Idaho Falls, where he worked on nuclear systems.</p><p>His desire to become an instructor never left him, however. In 1993 he joined Rutgers as an assistant professor of industrial and systems engineering.</p><p>Today his research focuses on reliability in modern, data-intensive systems, including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> AI</a> infrastructure and global<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers\" target=\"_self\"> data centers</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe problem now isn\u2019t getting data,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing which data to trust.\u201d</p><h2>Charting his IEEE journey</h2><p>Pham joined IEEE in 1985 as a student member and credits the organization with shaping much of his professional life. IEEE provided a platform for scholarship, collaboration, and visibility at critical moments in his career, he says.</p><p>He served as associate technical editor of<a href=\"https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-magazine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Communications Magazine</em></em></a> from 1992 to 2000, was a guest editor for a special issue on fault-tolerant software in the June 1993<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17387&amp;tip=sid#google_vignette\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Reliability</em></em></a>, and was the program vice chair of the annual IEEE<a href=\"https://rams.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Reliability and Maintainability Symposium</a> in 1994. In 2024 he returned to Vietnam as a plenary speaker at the 16th <a href=\"https://sice-si.org/SII2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration</a>.</p><p>In addition to being named a distinguished professor at Rutgers, he served as chair of the<a href=\"https://www.ise.rutgers.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> industrial and systems engineering department</a> from 2007 to 2013.</p><p>\u201cIf my journey holds one lesson,\u201d he says, \u201cit is this: Struggle builds resilience, and resilience makes the extraordinary possible. Even in darkness, perseverance lights the way.\u201d</p>"

That\u2019s a 36 percent jump from the company\u2019s previous outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and\u2014perhaps most significantly\u2014a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that could turn the data center boom into a bust.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_1\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p>The power grid engineering workforce is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">currently shrinking</a>, and data center operators are also hurting for trained <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-jobs\" target=\"_self\">electrical engineers</a>. Laura Laltrello, the chief operating officer for <a href=\"https://www.applieddigital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Applied Digital</a>, says demand has accelerated for civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers, as well as construction management and oversight positions in recent months. (Applied Digital is a data center developer and operator that is building two data center campuses near Harwood, North Dakota, that will require 1.4 GW of power when completed.) The growing demand for skilled workers has forced her company to widen the recruitment perimeter.</p><p>\u201cAs we anticipate a shortage of traditional engineering talent, we are sourcing from diverse industries,\u201d says Laltrello. \u201cWe are finding experts who understand power and cooling from sectors like nuclear energy, the military, and aerospace. Expertise doesn\u2019t have to come from a data center background.\u201d</p><h2>Growing Demand for Data Center Engineers</h2><p>For every engineer needed to design, specify, build, inspect, commission, or run a new AI data center, dozens of other positions are in short supply. According to the Association for Computer Operations and Management\u2019s (AFCOM) <a href=\"https://afcom.com/news/news.asp?id=692525\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Data Center Report 2025</a>, 58 percent of data center managers<span> </span>identified multiskilled data center operators as the top area of growth, while 50 percent signaled increasing demand for data center engineers. Security specialists are also a critical need.</p><p>Through the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for almost <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-14/whats-behind-the-projected-construction-employment-growth-from-2023-to-2033.htm\" target=\"_blank\">400,000 more construction workers by 2033</a>. By far the biggest needs are in power infrastructure, electricians, plumbing, and HVAC, <a target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and roughly </a><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">17,500 electrical and electronics engineers</a>.<span> </span>These categories directly map to the skills required to design, build, commission, and operate modern data centers.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is not simply the absolute number of workers available, but the timing and intensity of demand,\u201d says Bill Kleyman, author of the AFCOM report and the CEO of AI infrastructure firm <a href=\"https://www.apolo.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Apolo</a>. \u201cData centers are expanding at the same time that utilities, manufacturing, renewables, grid infrastructure, and construction are all competing for the same skilled labor pool, and AI is amplifying this pressure.\u201d</p><p>Data center developers like <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a> and construction firms like <a href=\"https://www.crusoe.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Crusoe</a> face enormous demands to build faster, bigger, and more power-dense facilities. For example, they\u2019re developing the Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, for Oracle and OpenAI. The project has two buildings that went live in October 2025, with another six scheduled for completion by the middle of 2026. The entire AI data center campus, once completed, will require 1.2 GW of power.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_6\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-mcnamara-1055211/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael McNamara</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a>, says that in one year his company can currently build enough AI data center infrastructure to require 1 GW of power. Big tech firms, he says, want this raised to 1 GW a quarter and eventually 1 GW per month or less.</p><p>That kind of ramp-up of construction pace calls for tens of thousands more engineers. The shortage of engineering talent is paralleled by persistent staffing shortages in data center operations and facility management professionals, electrical and mechanical technicians, high-voltage and power systems engineers, skilled HVAC technicians with experience in high-density or liquid cooling, and construction specialists familiar with complex mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) integration, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhawkins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Hawkins</a>, the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>director of education for Uptime Institute.</p><p>\u201cDemand for each category is rising significantly faster than supply,\u201d says Hawkins.</p><p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>Technical colleges and applied education programs are among the most effective engines for workforce growth in the data center industry. They focus on hands-on skills, facilities operations, power and cooling systems, and real-world job readiness. With so many new data centers being built in Texas, workforce programs are popping up all over that state. One example is the SMU Lyle School of Engineering\u2019s Master of Science in Datacenter Systems Engineering (MS DSE) in Dallas. The program blends electrical engineering, IT, facilities management, business continuity, and cybersecurity. There is also a 12-week AI data center technician program at Dallas College and a similar program at Texas State Technical College near Waco.</p><p>\u201cTechnical colleges are driving the charge in bringing new talent to an industry undergoing exponential growth with an almost infinite appetite for skilled workers,\u201d says Wendy Schuchart, an association manager at AFCOM.</p><p>Vendors and industry associations are actively addressing the talent gap too. Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/datacenteracademy.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Datacenter Academy</a> is a public-private partnership involving community colleges in regions where Microsoft operates data center facilities. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://datacenters.google/workforce-development-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google supports</a> local nonprofits and colleges offering training in IT and data center operations, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/technical-apprenticeships\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon offers data center apprenticeships</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/us/en/products/energy/low-voltage/siemens-educates-america.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens Educates America</a> program has surpassed 32,000 apprenticeships across 32 states, 36 labs, and 72 partner industry labor organizations. The company has committed to training 200,000 electricians and electrical manufacturing workers by 2030. Similarly, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) operates the <a href=\"https://www.electricaltrainingalliance.org/AboutUs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electrical Training Alliance</a>; the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) offers <a href=\"https://learn.toolingu.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ToolingU-SME</a>, aimed at expanding<strong> </strong>the manufacturing workforce; and <a href=\"https://uptimeinstitute.com/education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uptime Institute Education</a><strong> </strong>programs look to accelerate the readiness of technicians and operators.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_12\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p>\u201cEvery university we speak with is thinking about this challenge and shifting its curriculum to prepare students for the future of digital infrastructure,\u201d said Laltrello. \u201cThe best way to predict the future is to build it.\u201d</p>"

Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills\u2014capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace.</p><p>AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybercrime\" target=\"_self\">cybercrime</a>, predict equipment failures in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stealthy-startup-aims-to-reinvent-ai-for-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">manufacturing</a>, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-jobs\" target=\"_self\">mass layoffs</a> across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals.</p><p>Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/discover-manager-credit-card-fraud\" target=\"_self\">banking</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotic-process-automation-gokul-pandy\" target=\"_self\">health care</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai\" target=\"_self\">retail</a>, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making\u2014and keep up with the competition.</p><p>The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/san-murugesan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Murugesan</a> and<a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rneamtu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Rodica Neamtu</a>.</p><p>Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at <a href=\"https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Western Sydney University</a>, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at <a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, in Massachusetts.</p><p>The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains.</p><p>The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework.</p><h2>Why AI careers are being redefined</h2><p>AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy.</p><p>Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write.</p><p>The guide cites surveys of executives about AI\u2019s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey & Co.</a> The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants\u2019 insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate.</p><p>The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve.</p><h2>Developing complementary skills</h2><p>The strategic approach aligns with advice from <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/neil-thompson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Thompson</a>, director of FutureTech research at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.</p><p>\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,\u201d he says. \u201cApplying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.\u201d</p><h2>The technical foundation still matters</h2><p>Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning\" target=\"_self\"> machine learning</a>, and computing infrastructure.</p><p>Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say.</p><p>Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say.</p><p>Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Web Services</a>,<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Cloud</a>, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmfq865whp_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21503043035&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_sCA_X2u0APALLSysANK0Vhk&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure</a> is important, according to the guide\u2019s authors.</p><p>Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2025\" target=\"_self\">Python</a> has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models.</p><h2>From algorithms to frameworks</h2><p>The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PyTorch</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.meta.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meta AI</a>, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scikit-learn</a> provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. <strong>\u2014Neil Thompson, MIT</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TensorFlow</a>, a software library for machine learning and AI created by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?zx=1767047914659&amp;no_sw_cr=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction.</p><p>The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints.</p><h2>Soft skills as career insurance</h2><p>Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders.</p><p>Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning.</p><p>Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt.</p><h2>Experience before titles</h2><p>The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience.</p><p>Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career.</p><h2>Entry-level roles that open doors</h2><p>Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide.</p><p>Each starting point reinforces the guide\u2019s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance.</p><h2>Curiosity as a long-term strategy</h2><p>Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process.</p><p>\u201cAlways be curious,\u201d he says. \u201cLearn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.\u201d</p><p>Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one\u2019s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend.</p><p>In a field where today\u2019s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide\u2019s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.</p>"

Like a bird on a wire, bare-hands workers are electrically floating, rather than grounded, so current largely bypasses them via the line itself.</p><h2>Induction Safety Suit Design</h2><p>Backed by a US $250,000 investment from Xcel in 2019, Electrostatics adapted its standard suits by adding low-resistance conductive straps that pass current around a worker\u2019s body. \u201cWhen I\u2019m touching a conductor with one hand and the other hand is grounded, the current will flow through the straps to get out,\u201d says <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/n%25C3%25A9meth-b%25C3%25A1lint-1a366586?originalSubdomain=hu\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00e1lint N\u00e9meth</a>, Electrostatics\u2019 CEO and director of the <a href=\"https://nfl.vet.bme.hu/en/\" target=\"_blank\">High Voltage Laboratory</a> at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man holds one side of his jacket open revealing conductive straps inside.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c7b7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-holds-one-side-of-his-jacket-open-revealing-conductive-straps-inside.jpg?id=62695052&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A strapping system links all the elements of the suit\u2014the jacket, trousers, gloves, and socks\u2014and guides current through a controlled path outside the body. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">BME HVL </small></p><p>The company began selling the suits in 2023, and they have since been adopted by over a dozen transmission operators in the United States and Europe, as well as other countries including Canada, Indonesia, and Turkey. They cost about $5,200 in the United States.</p><p>Electrostatics\u2019 suits had to meet a crucial design threshold: keeping body exposure below the 6-milliampere \u201clet-go\u201d threshold, beyond which electrocuted workers become unable to remove themselves from a circuit. \u201cIf you lose control of your muscles, you\u2019re going to hold onto the conductor until you pass out or possibly die,\u201d says Ramirez Bettoni.</p><p>The gear, which includes the suit, gloves, and socks, protects against 100 amperes for 10 seconds and 50 A for 30 seconds. It also has insulation to protect against heat created by high current and flame retardants to protect against electric arcs.</p><p>Kropp, N\u00e9meth, and Ramirez Bettoni are hoping that developing industry standards for induction safety gear, including <a href=\"https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/standard-performance-specification-for-conductive-clothing-for-industry-applications\" target=\"_blank\">ones published in October</a>, will broaden their use.

Many of these approaches require a change in the materials used for computation, which would demand an overhaul in the CMOS fabrication techniques used today.</span></p><p>Over the past decade, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-hector-j-de-los-santos-phd-ieee-fellow-6111291/\" target=\"_blank\">Hector De Los Santos</a> has been working on yet another new approach. The technique would require the same exact materials used in CMOS, preserving the costly equipment, yet still allow computations to be performed in a radically different way. Instead of the motion of individual electrons\u2014current\u2014computations can be done with the collective, wavelike propagations in a sea of electrons, known as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanosensors-perform-sensing-on-demand\" target=\"_self\">plasmons</a>.</p><p>De Los Santos, an IEEE Fellow, first <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5233891\" target=\"_blank\">proposed the idea</a> of computing with plasmons back in 2010. More recently, in 2024, De Los Santos and collaborators from University of South Carolina, Ohio State University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/14/6/065321/3297922\" target=\"_blank\">created a device</a> that demonstrated the main component of plasmon-based logic: the ability to control one plasmon with another. We caught up with De Los Santos to understand the details of this novel technological proposal.</p><h2>How Plasmon Computing Works</h2><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: How did you first come up with the idea for plasmon computing?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> I got the idea of plasmon computing around 2009, upon observing the direction in which the field of CMOS logic was going. In particular, they were following the downscaling paradigm in which, by reducing the size of transistors, you would cram more and more transistors in a certain area, and that would increase the performance. However, if you follow that paradigm to its conclusion, as the device sizes are reduced, quantum mechanical effects come into play, as well as leakage. When the devices are very small, a number of effects called short channel effects come into play, which manifest themselves as increased power dissipation.</p><p>So I began to think, \u201cHow can we solve this problem of improving the performance of logic devices while using the same fabrication techniques employed for CMOS\u2014that is, while exploiting the current infrastructure?\u201d I came across an old logic paradigm called fluidic logic, which uses <a href=\"https://plcsitemiz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/modern-control-engineering-kogata-3rd-edition.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">fluids</a>. For example, jets of air whose direction was impacted by other jets of air could implement logic functions. So I had the idea, why don\u2019t we implement a paradigm analogous to that one, but instead of using air as a fluid, we use localized electron charge density waves\u2014plasmons. Not electrons, but electron disturbances.</p><p>And now the timing is very appropriate because, as most people know, AI is very power intensive. People are coming against a brick wall on how to go about solving the power consumption issue, and the current technology is not going to solve that problem.</p><p><strong>What is a plasmon, exactly?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> Plasmons are basically the disturbance of the electron density. If you have what is called an electron sea, you can imagine a pond of water. When you disturb the surface, you create waves. And these waves, the undulations on the surface of this water, propagate through the water. That is an almost perfect analogy to plasmons. In the case of plasmons, you have a sea of electrons. And instead of using a pebble or a piece of wood tapping on the surface of the water to create a wave that propagates, you tap this sea of electrons with an electromagnetic wave.</p><p><strong>How do plasmons promise to overcome the scaling issues of traditional CMOS logic? </strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> Going back to the analogy of the throwing the pebble on the pond: It takes very, very low energy to create this kind of disturbance. The energy to excite a plasmon is on the order of attojoules or less. And the disturbance that you generate propagates very fast. A disturbance propagates faster than a particle. Plasmons propagate in unison with the electromagnetic wave that generates them, which is the speed of light in the medium. So just intrinsically, the way of operation is extremely fast and extremely low power compared to current technology.</p><p>In addition to that, current CMOS technology dissipates power even if it\u2019s not used. Here, that\u2019s not the case. If there is no wave propagating, then there is no power dissipation.</p><p><strong>How do you do logic operations with plasmons?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> You pattern long, thin wires in a configuration in the shape of the letter Y. At the base of the Y you launch a plasmon. Call this the bias plasmon, this is the bit. If you don\u2019t do anything, when this plasmon gets to the junction it will split in two, so at the output of the Y, you will detect two equal electric field strengths.</p><p>Now, imagine that at the Y junction you apply another wire at an angle to the incoming wire. Along that new wire, you send another plasmon, called a control plasmon. You can use the control plasmon to redirect the original bias plasmon into one leg of the Y.</p><p>Plasmons are charge disturbances, and two plasmons have the same nature: They either are both positive or both negative. So, they repel each other if you force them to converge into a junction. And by controlling the angle of the control plasmon impinging on the junction, you can control the angle of the plasmon coming out of the junction. And that way you can steer one plasmon with another one. The control plasmon simply joins the incoming plasmon, so you end up with double the voltage on one leg.</p><p>You can do this from both sides, add a wire and a control plasmon on either side of the junction so you can redirect the plasmon into either leg of the Y, giving you a zero or a one.</p><h2>Building a Plasmon-Based Logic Device<br /></h2><p><strong>You\u2019ve built this Y-junction device and demonstrated steering a plasmon to one side in 2024. Can you describe the device and its operation?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> The Y-junction device is about 5 square [micrometers]. The Y is made up of the following: a metal on top of an oxide, on top of a semiconducting wafer, on top of a ground plane. Now, between the oxide and the wafer, you have to generate a charge density\u2014this is the sea of electrons. To do that, you apply a DC voltage between the metal of the Y and the ground plane, and that generates your static sea of electrons. Then you impinge upon that with an incoming electromagnetic wave, again between the metal and ground plane. When the electromagnetic wave reaches the static charge density, the sea of electrons that was there generates a localized electron charge density disturbance: a plasmon.</p><p>Now, if you launch a plasmon by itself, it will quickly dissipate. It will not propagate very far.<strong> </strong>In my setup, the reason why the plasmon survives is because it is being regenerated. As the electromagnetic field propagates, you keep regenerating the plasmons, creating new plasmons at its front end.</p><p><strong>What is left to be done before you can implement full computer logic?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> I demonstrated the partial device, that is just the interaction of two plasmons. The next step would be to demonstrate and fabricate the full device, which would have the two controls. And after that gets done, the next step is concatenating them to create a full adder, because that is the fundamental computing logic component.</p><p><strong>What do you think are going to be the main challenges going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> I think the main challenge is that the technology doesn\u2019t follow from today\u2019s paradigm of logic devices based on current flows. This is based on wave flows. People are accustomed to other things, and it may be difficult to understand the device. The different concepts that are brought together in this device are not normally employed by the dominant technology, and it is really interdisciplinary in nature. You have to know about metal-oxide-semiconductor physics, then you have to know about electromagnetic waves, then you have to know about quantum field theory. The knowledge base to understand the device rarely exists in a single head. Maybe another next step is to try to make it more accessible. Getting people to sponsor the work and to understand it is a challenge, not really the implementation. There\u2019s not really a fabrication limitation. </p><p>But in my opinion, the usual approaches are just doomed, for two reasons. First, they are not reversible, meaning information is lost in the computation, which results in energy loss. Second, as the devices shrink energy dissipation increases, posing an insurmountable barrier. In contrast, plasmon computation is inherently reversible, and there is no fundamental reason it should dissipate any energy during switching.<strong></strong></p>"
