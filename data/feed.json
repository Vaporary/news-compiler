Combining our measures with Census data on occupation employment, we show that technological progress over the 20th century has led to economically meaningful shifts in labor demand across occupations: it has consistently increased demand for occupations with higher education requirements, occupations that pay higher wages, and occupations with a greater fraction of female workers. Using these insights and a calibrated model, we then explore different scenarios for how advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are likely to impact employment trends in the medium run. The model predicts a reversal of past trends, with AI favoring occupations that are lower-educated, lower-paid, and more male-dominated."

        "summary": "This paper provides systematic evidence on the macroeconomic consequences of war using a new dataset covering 115 conflicts and 145 countries over the past 75 years. We document three main findings. First, conflict generates large and persistent real effects: real GDP falls by 13% on average with no recovery even after a decade, while investment collapses as financial frictions reduce domestic credit. The drop in real activity is more pronounced for civil wars than it is for interstate conflicts. Second, government finances deteriorate as revenues contract while expenditures remain stable, thus raising primary deficits. Real government debt also declines, and governments shift 1.2% of GDP towards short maturities. Third, governments rely heavily on inflation to finance their deficits: the price level and money supply both rise by nearly 50%, eroding debt and generating seigniorage but also depressing investment and raising the cost of imported capital goods."

        "summary": "We examine global trends in productivity and sectoral dominance across countries and industries, asking whether changes are driven by productivity catch-up or shifts in factor endowments. To address this, we develop a general-equilibrium, multi-country, multi-sector model with a global production network based on international input--output linkages. The model incorporates country-specific technologies, factor endowments (skilled and unskilled labor and capital), and tariffs. Calibrating the model to international data from 1996 to 2007, we find that in high-income countries productivity changes are mainly driven by technology, while in middle-income countries capital is most crucial. We then assess whether these changes explain structural transformation in global output shares. For most industries where one group of countries overtakes another, the primary cause is the change in capital and skilled labor, rather than factor-induced productivity improvements. Overall, factor endowment shifts play the central role in explaining changes in sectoral dominance across countries and industries."

        "summary": "This paper investigates how hospital competition and insurance reimbursement policy shape the diffusion of medical innovations. Using patient-level data from Taiwan's drug-eluting stent (DES) market in the Taipei metropolitan area, we estimate a structural model of hospital behavior, incorporating patient demand and hospitals' endogenous portfolio and pricing decisions. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: intense competition lowers prices but weakens hospitals' incentives to adopt new technologies, with total welfare peaking at an intermediate level of concentration. We then evaluate policy solutions. Selective contracting\u2014where the government insurer negotiates exclusive wholesale discounts\u2014can achieve a ``quadruple-win'' for consumers, hospitals, participating manufacturers, and the payer. In contrast, increasing the insurer's DES-specific reimbursement encourages hospitals to expand DES technology adoption and lower patient payment per DES, but creates a substantial fiscal burden for the insurer. Alternatively, a patient coupon program targeting low-income patients improves equity but has limited market-wide impact, as hospitals barely modify their price or portfolio decisions in response. These findings highlight that effective technology diffusion policies must account for downstream hospitals' strategic responses and their market competition."

These novel factors account for only 20% of the residual gap unexplained by education and occupation.

Our findings reveal significant gaps in public understanding of fiscal policy. Individuals consistently underestimate debt levels, particularly in high-debt countries, and tend to believe that fiscal adjustments will disproportionately affect them. We further show that greater lifetime exposure to fiscal consolidation is associated with increased pessimism about future economic prospects, reduced trust in government, and heightened expectations of rising debt, future tax increases, spending cuts, and inflation. Through randomized controlled experiments, we assess the causal impact of providing information about actual debt levels on household expectations. Informing respondents about their country\u2019s debt levels lowers expectations of tax increases in contexts of stable debt and raises expectations of spending cuts in countries with rising debt. The effect of this information is moderated by individuals\u2019 past experiences with fiscal consolidation, underscoring the interplay between historical context and current perceptions of fiscal policy."

And as our machines gain more power, they\u2019re becoming not just tools but decision-makers shaping our future.</p><p>But with great power comes great\u2026heat!</p><p>As nanometer-scale transistors switch at gigahertz speeds, electrons race through circuits, losing energy as heat\u2014which you feel when your laptop or your phone toasts your fingers. As we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trillion-transistor-gpu\" target=\"_self\">crammed more and more transistors onto chips</a>, we\u2019ve lost the room to release that heat efficiently. Instead of the heat spreading out quickly across the silicon, which makes it much easier to remove, it builds up to form hot spots, which can be tens of degrees warmer than the rest of the chip. That extreme heat forces systems to throttle the performance of CPUs and GPUs to avoid degrading the chips.</p><p>In other words, what began as a quest for miniaturization has turned into a battle against thermal energy. This challenge extends across all electronics. In computing, high-performance processors demand ever-increasing power densities. (New Nvidia GPU B300 servers will consume <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-b300/\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 15 kilowatts</a> of power.) In communication, both digital and analog systems push transistors to deliver more power for stronger signals and faster data rates. In the power electronics used for energy conversion and distribution, efficiency gains are being countered by thermal constraints.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A thick sheet of gray-scale grains.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d15b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-thick-sheet-of-gray-scale-grains.png?id=61766971&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The ability to grow large-grained polycrystalline diamond at low temperature led to a new way to combat heat in transistors. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Mohamadali Malakoutian</small></p><p>Rather than allowing heat to build up, what if we could spread it out right from the start, inside the chip?\u2014diluting it like a cup of boiling water dropped into a swimming pool. Spreading out the heat would lower the temperature of the most critical devices and circuits and let the other time-tested cooling technologies work more efficiently. To do that, we\u2019d have to introduce a highly thermally conductive material inside the IC, mere nanometers from the transistors, without messing up any of their very precise and sensitive properties. Enter an unexpected material\u2014diamond.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>In some ways, diamond is ideal. It\u2019s one of the most thermally conductive materials on the planet\u2014many times more efficient than copper\u2014yet it\u2019s also electrically insulating. However, integrating it into chips is tricky: Until recently we knew how to grow it only at circuit-slagging temperatures in excess of 1,000 \u00b0C.</p><p>But my research group at Stanford University has managed what seemed impossible. We can now grow a form of diamond suitable for spreading heat, directly atop semiconductor devices at low enough temperatures that even the most delicate interconnects inside advanced chips will survive. To be clear, this isn\u2019t the kind of diamond you see in jewelry, which is a large single crystal. Our diamonds are a polycrystalline coating no more than a couple of micrometers thick.</p><p>The potential benefits could be huge. In some of our earliest gallium-nitride radio-frequency transistors, the addition of diamond dropped the device temperature by more than 50 \u00b0C. At the lower temperature, the transistors amplified X-band radio signals five times as well as before. We think our diamond will be even more important for advanced CMOS chips. Researchers predict that upcoming chipmaking technologies could make hot spots almost 10 \u00b0C hotter [see , \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_self\">Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever</a>\u201d, in this issue]. That\u2019s probably why our research is drawing intense interest from the chip industry, including Applied Materials, Samsung, and TSMC. If our work continues to succeed as it has, heat will become a far less onerous constraint in CMOS and other electronics too.</p><h2>Where Heat Begins and Ends in Chips</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A rectangle of black fading into bright gray at the bottom.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d8b96\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rectangle-of-black-fading-into-bright-gray-at-the-bottom.png?id=61766985&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the boundary between the diamond and the semiconductor, a thin layer of silicon carbide forms. It acts as a bridge for heat to flow into the diamond. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Mohamadali Malakoutian</small></p><p>Heat starts within transistors and the interconnects that link them, as the flow of current meets resistance. That means most of it is generated near the surface of the semiconductor substrate. From there it rises either through layers of metal and insulation or through the semiconductor itself, depending on the package architecture. The heat then encounters a thermal interface material designed to spread it out before it ultimately reaches a heat sink, a radiator, or some sort of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">liquid cooling</a>, where air or fluid carries the heat away.</p><p>The dominant cooling strategies today center around advances in heat sinks, fans, and radiators. In pursuit of even better cooling, researchers have explored liquid cooling using microfluidic channels and removing heat using phase-change materials. Some computer clusters go so far as to submerge the servers in thermally conductive, dielectric\u2014electrically insulating\u2014liquids.</p><p>These innovations are critical steps forward, but they still have limitations. Some are so expensive they\u2019re worthwhile only for the highest-performing chips; others are simply too bulky for the job. (Your smartphone can\u2019t carry a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/xmems\" target=\"_self\">conventional fan</a>.) And none are likely to be very effective as we move toward chip architectures resembling silicon skyscrapers that stack multiple layers of chips. Such <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_self\">3D systems</a> are only as viable as our ability to remove heat from every layer within it.</p><p>The big problem is that chip materials are poor heat conductors, so the heat becomes trapped and concentrated, causing the temperature to skyrocket within the chip. At higher temperatures, transistors leak more current, wasting power; they age more quickly, too.</p><p>Heat spreaders allow the heat to move laterally, diluting it and allowing the circuits to cool. But they\u2019re positioned far\u2014relatively, of course\u2014from where the heat is generated, and so they\u2019re of little help with these hot spots. We need a heat-spreading technology that can exist within nanometers of where the heat is generated. This is where our new low-temperature diamond could be essential.</p><h2>How to Make Diamonds</h2><p>Before my lab turned to developing diamond as a heat-spreading material, we were working on it as a semiconductor. In its single-crystal form\u2014like the kind on your finger\u2014it has a wide bandgap and ability to withstand enormous electric fields. Single-crystalline diamond also offers some of the highest thermal conductivity recorded in any material, reaching 2,200 to 2,400 watts per meter per kelvin\u2014roughly six times as conductive as copper. Polycrystalline diamond\u2014an easier to make material\u2014can approach these values when grown thick. Even in this form, it outperforms copper.</p><p>As attractive as diamond transistors might be, I was keenly aware\u2014based on my experience researching gallium nitride devices\u2014of the long road ahead. The problem is one of scale. Several companies are working to scale high-purity diamond substrates to 50, 75, and even 100 millimeters but the diamond substrates we could acquire commercially were only about 3 mm across.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A polygon with layers demarcated in it surrounded by a jagged blue area. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"38b33\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-polygon-with-layers-demarcated-in-it-surrounded-by-a-jagged-blue-area.png?id=61771341&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors were an ideal test case for diamond cooling. The devices are 3D and the critical heat-generating part, the two-dimensional electron gas, is close to the surface. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chris Philpot</small></p>So we decided instead to try growing diamond films on large silicon wafers, in the hope of moving toward commercial-scale diamond substrates. In general, this is done by reacting methane and hydrogen at high temperatures, 900 \u00b0C or more. This results in not a single crystal but a forest of narrow columns. As they grow taller, the nanocolumns coalesce into a uniform film, but by the time they form high-quality polycrystalline diamond, the film is already very thick. This thick growth adds stress to the material and often leads to cracking and other problems.<p>But what if we used this polycrystalline coating as a heat spreader for other devices? If we could get diamond to grow within nanometers of transistors, get it to spread heat both vertically and laterally, and integrate it seamlessly with the silicon, metal, and dielectric in chips, it might do the job.</p><p>There were good reasons to think it would work. Diamond is electrically insulating, and it has a relatively low dielectric constant. That means it makes a poor capacitor, so signals sent through diamond-encrusted interconnects might not degrade much. Thus diamond could act as a \u201cthermal dielectric,\u201d one that is electrically insulating but thermally conducting.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"SEM images showing surface before and after polycrystalline diamond growth on silicon oxide.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"94099\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/sem-images-showing-surface-before-and-after-polycrystalline-diamond-growth-on-silicon-oxide.png?id=61771368&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Polycrystalline diamond could help reduce temperatures inside 3D chips. Diamond thermal vias would grow inside micrometers-deep holes so heat can flow from vertically from one chip to a diamond heat spreader in another chip that\u2019s stacked atop it.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dennis Rich</small></p><p>For our plan to work, we were going to have to learn to grow diamond differently. We knew there wasn\u2019t room to grow a thick film inside a chip. We also knew the narrow, spiky crystal pillars made in the first part of the growth process don\u2019t transmit heat laterally very well, so we\u2019d need to grow large-grained crystals from the start to get the heat moving horizontally. A third problem was that the existing diamond films didn\u2019t form a coating on the sides of devices, which would be important for inherently 3D devices. But the biggest impediment was the high temperature needed to grow the diamond film, which would damage, if not destroy, an IC\u2019s circuits. We were going to have to cut the growth temperature at least in half.</p><p>Just lowering the temperature doesn\u2019t work. (We tried: You wind up, basically, with soot, which is electrically conductive\u2014the opposite of what\u2019s needed.) We found that adding oxygen to the mix helped, because it continuously etched away carbon deposits that weren\u2019t diamond. And through <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/9/10/498\" target=\"_blank\">extensive experimentation</a>, we were able to find a formula that produced coatings of large-grained polycrystalline diamond all around devices at 400 \u00b0C, which is a survivable temperature for CMOS circuits and other devices.</p><h2>Thermal Boundary Resistance</h2><p>Although we had found a way to grow the right kind of diamond coatings, we faced another critical challenge\u2014the phonon bottleneck, also known as thermal boundary resistance (TBR). Phonons are packets of heat energy, in the way that photons are packets of electromagnetic energy. Specifically, they\u2019re a quantized version of the vibration of a crystal lattice. These phonons can pile up at the boundary between materials, resisting the flow of heat. Reducing TBR has long been a goal in thermal interface engineering, and it is often done by introducing different materials at the boundary. But semiconductors are compatible only with certain materials, limiting our choices.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A cartoon of squares stacked atop one another and connected by a forest of vertical links. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"386f9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-cartoon-of-squares-stacked-atop-one-another-and-connected-by-a-forest-of-vertical-links.png?id=61771378&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Thermal scaffolding would link layers of heat-spreading polycrystalline diamond in one chip to those in another chip in a 3D-stacked silicon. The thermal pillars would traverse each chip\u2019s interconnects and dielectric material to move heat vertically through the stack. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Srabanti Chowdhury</small></p><p>In the end, we got lucky. While growing diamond on GaN capped with silicon nitride, we observed something unexpected: The measured TBR was <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c13833\" target=\"_blank\">much lower than prior reports led us to expect</a>. (The low TBR was independently measured, initially by <a href=\"https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-h-h-kuball\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Kuball</a> at the University of Bristol, in England, and later by <a href=\"https://me.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1618/Samuel-GrahamJr\" target=\"_blank\">Samuel Graham Jr</a>., then at Georgia Tech, who both have been coauthors and collaborators in several of our papers.)</p><p>Through further investigation of the interface science and engineering, and in collaboration with <a href=\"https://mse.utdallas.edu/ourteam/faculty/cho-k/\" target=\"_blank\">K.J. Cho</a> at the University of Texas at Dallas, we identified the cause of the lower TBR. <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413734\" target=\"_blank\">Intermixing at the interface</a> between the diamond and silicon nitride led to the formation of silicon carbide, which acted as a kind of bridge for the phonons, allowing more efficient heat transfer. Though this began as a scientific discovery, its technological impact was immediate\u2014with a silicon carbide interface, our devices exhibited significantly improved thermal performance.</p><h2>GaN HEMTs: The First Test Case</h2><p>We began testing our new low-TBR diamond coatings in gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). These devices amplify RF signals by controlling current through a two-dimensional electron gas that forms within its channel. We leveraged the pioneering research on HEMTs done by <a href=\"https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/umesh-mishra\" target=\"_blank\">Umesh Mishra</a>\u2019s laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I had been a graduate student. The Mishra lab invented a particular form of the material called N-polar gallium nitride. Their N-polar GaN HEMTs demonstrate exceptional power density at high frequencies, particularly in the W-band, the 75- to 110-gigahertz part of the microwave spectrum.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/silicon-carbide\" target=\"_self\">Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide Fight for Green Tech Domination</a></p><p>What made these HEMTs such a good test case is one defining feature of the device: The gate, which controls the flow of current through the device, is within tens of nanometers of the transistor\u2019s channel. That means that heat is generated very close to the surface of the device, and any interference our diamond coating could cause would quickly show in the device\u2019s operation.</p><p>We introduced the diamond layer so that it surrounded the HEMT completely, even on the sides. By maintaining a growth temperature below 400 \u00b0C, we hoped to preserve core device functionality. While we did see some decline in high-frequency performance, the thermal benefits were substantial\u2014<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019509\" target=\"_blank\">channel temperatures dropped by a remarkable 70 \u00b0C</a>. This breakthrough could be a potentially transformative solution for RF systems, allowing them to operate at higher power than ever before.</p><h2>Diamond in CMOS</h2><p>We wondered if our diamond layer could also work in high-power CMOS chips. My colleagues at Stanford, <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~hspwong/\" target=\"_blank\">H.-S. Philip Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/subhasish-mitra\" target=\"_blank\">Subhasish Mitra</a>, have long championed 3D-stacked chip architectures. In CMOS computing chips, 3D stacking appears to be the most viable way forward to increase integration density, improve performance, and overcome the limitations of traditional transistor scaling. It\u2019s already used in some advanced AI chips, such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-mi300\" target=\"_self\">AMD\u2019s MI300 series</a>. And it\u2019s established in the high-bandwidth memory chips that pump data through Nvidia GPUs and other AI processors. The multiple layers of silicon in these 3D stacks are mostly connected by microscopic balls of solder, or in some advanced cases just by their copper terminals. Getting signals and power out of these stacks requires vertical copper links that burrow through the silicon to reach the chip package\u2019s substrate.</p><p>In one of our discussions, Mitra pointed out that a critical issue with 3D-stacked chips is the thermal bottlenecks that form within the stack. In 3D architectures, the traditional heat sinks and other techniques used for 2D chips aren\u2019t sufficient. Extracting heat from each layer is essential.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Our research could redefine thermal management across industries.</p><p>Our experiments on thermal boundary resistance in GaN suggested a similar approach would work in silicon. And when we integrated diamond with silicon, the results were remarkable: An interlayer of silicon carbide formed, leading to diamond with an excellent thermal interface.</p><p>Our effort introduced the concept of thermal scaffolding. In that scheme, nanometers-thick layers of polycrystalline diamond would be integrated within the dielectric layers above the transistors to spread heat. These layers would then be connected by vertical heat conductors, called thermal pillars, made of copper or more diamond. These pillars would connect to another heat spreader, which in turn would link to thermal pillars on the next chip in the 3D stack, and so on until the heat reached the heat sink or other cooling device.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Temperature vs. compute tier graph; AI accelerator heats most without scaffold.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8310e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/temperature-vs-compute-tier-graph-ai-accelerator-heats-most-without-scaffold.png?id=61771384&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The more tiers of computing silicon in a 3D chip, the bigger difference thermal scaffolding makes. An AI accelerator with more than five tiers would well exceed typical temperature limits unless the scaffolding was employed. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Srabanti Chowdhury</small></p>In a collaboration with Mitra, we used simulations of heat generated by real computational workloads to operate a proof-of-concept structure. This structure consisted of dummy heaters to mimic hot spots in a two-chip stack along with diamond heat spreaders and copper thermal pillars. Using this, we <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873424\" target=\"_blank\">reduced the temperature to one-tenth</a> its value without the scaffolding.<p>There are hurdles still to overcome. In particular, we still have to figure out a way to make the top of our diamond coatings atomically flat. But, in collaboration with industry partners and researchers, we are systematically studying that problem and other scientific and technological issues. We and our partners think this research could offer a disruptive new path for thermal management and a crucial step toward sustaining high-performance computing into the future.</p><h2>Developing Diamond Thermal Solutions</h2><p>We now intend to move toward industry integration. For example, we\u2019re working with the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/threads-heat-removal\" target=\"_blank\">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Threads</a> program, which aims to use device-level thermal management to develop highly efficient and reliable X-band power amplifiers with a power density 6 to 8 times as efficient as today\u2019s devices. The program, which was conceived and initially run by <a href=\"https://forward.darpa.mil/presenters/Dr-Thomas-Kazior\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Kazior</a>, is a critical platform for validating the use of low-temperature diamond integration in GaN HEMT manufacturing. It\u2019s enabled us to collaborate closely with industry teams while protecting both our and our partners\u2019 processes. Defense applications demand exceptional reliability, and our diamond-integrated HEMTs are undergoing rigorous testing with industry partners. The early results are promising, guiding refinements in growth processes and integration techniques that we\u2019ll make with our partners over the next two years.</p><p>But our vision extends beyond GaN HEMTs to <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.35848/1882-0786/abf4f1\" target=\"_blank\">other materials</a> and particularly silicon computational chips. For the latter, we have an established collaboration with TSMC, and we\u2019re expanding on newer opportunities with Applied Materials, Micron, Samsung, and others through the <a href=\"https://systemx.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford SystemX Alliance</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.src.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Semiconductor Research Corp.</a> This is an extraordinary level of collaboration among otherwise fierce competitors. But then, heat is a universal challenge in chip manufacturing, and everyone is motivated to find the best solutions.</p><p>If successful, our research could redefine thermal management across industries. In my work on gallium nitride devices, I have seen firsthand how once-radical ideas like this transition to become industry standards, and I believe diamond-based heat extraction will follow the same trajectory, becoming a critical enabler for a generation of electronics that is no longer hindered by heat. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

But the theory hasn\u2019t always matched up to reality. Real-world <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking\" target=\"_blank\">mesh networks</a> have proved vulnerable to shutdowns in some of <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/albrecht\" target=\"_blank\">the very settings</a>, such as certain kinds of large crowds, they\u2019re supposed to be good at handling.</p><p>So researchers from Johns Hopkins University, Harvard, and the City College of New York have recently built a prototype mesh networking system that\u2019s been hardened for some of the most challenging and adversarial environments around: political protests.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1872\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> presented last week at the ACM <a href=\"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Conference on Computer and Communications Security</a> in Taipei, the researchers announced a prototype mesh network called Amigo. <span>Amigo, for starters, has been designed to work in environments where the Internet has been shut off, as seen during unrest in <a href=\"https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/shutdowns/\" target=\"_blank\">India, Iraq, and Syria</a>, among other countries.</span></p><p>\u201cShutting down the internet during times of great civil protest is a way to prevent people from being able to organize and come together,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/tushar-jois\" target=\"_blank\">Tushar Jois</a>, assistant professor of electrical engineering at City College. \u201cThat is what we\u2019re specifically tailoring our technology for.\u201d</p><p>Amigo proposes at least three ways to bolster the more traditional approaches to mesh networks. <a href=\"https://martinralbrecht.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bridgefy-abridged.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recent scholarship</a> on mesh outages in protest scenarios reveals problems such as network messages failing to deliver, appearing out of order, and exposing users to being traced\u2014even if the nodes in the network (e.g. phones running the mesh app) are right next to each other. The researchers found that prying beneath the mesh network\u2019s high-level, encrypted communications and down into nuts-and-bolts <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lifi-standards\" target=\"_self\">Wi-Fi</a> operations revealed opportunities that previous mesh networks had failed to seize on.</p><p>\u201cThe story is the cryptography alone won\u2019t save us,\u201d says Jois. Jois and colleagues presented a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5lInx9-vP8\" target=\"_blank\">version of their Amigo paper</a> earlier this year at the <a href=\"https://rwc.iacr.org/2025/program.php\" target=\"_blank\">Real World Cryptography conference</a> in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p><h3>Why Political Protests Matter in Mesh Networks</h3><p><span>Amigo</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/about-us/news/using-messaging-service-bridgefy-could-have-dire-consequences-for-users-if-privacy-protection-issues-aren-t-fixed/\" target=\"_blank\">drew key lessons from</a><span> a set of </span><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/albrecht\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a><span> on mesh networking in a range of recent political protests\u2014including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong pro-democracy actions in 2019 and \u201920</a>. </span><span></span></p><p>For example, how previous mesh networks handled routing of their messages could accidentally lead to a flooding of the zone. Multiple nodes in a stressed network can pump out redundant messages into the network, causing communications to grind to a crawl. By contrast, Amigo forms what the researchers call dynamic \u201ccliques\u201d\u2014where only designated leader nodes exchange messages with each other, while regular nodes just talk to their leader. This technique, the researchers say, substantially reduces message traffic, decreasing the chance the network might seize up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re one of the people to discover that in secure mesh messaging, we\u2019ve had this blind spot,\u201d Jois says. \u201cSo we proposed some new algorithms that help address this blind spot. Dynamic clique routing basically allows groups of nodes to self-organize routing units in a geographic area based on GPS.\u201d</p><p>Another example is Amigo\u2019s approach to cryptography and anonymity. Previous mesh environments provided no easy way to remove members from encrypted groups. (In a protest setting, group removal might be necessary, for instance, because a device or its user has been apprehended by authorities.) Older mesh standards also leaked metadata that could reveal other group members. <span>Amigo aims to correct both problems.</span></p><p>\u201cOne thing we talk about is outsider anonymity,\u201d Jois says. \u201cPeople who are outside your group don\u2019t know that the group exists.\u201d Amigo, he says, adds new algorithms to ensure outsider anonymity and group removal. Jois adds that Amigo aims to achieve these goals while still retaining protections of existing encrypted-message networks like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/encrypted-messaging-app\" target=\"_self\">WhatsApp and Signal</a>.</p><p>Traditionally, Jois adds, encrypted messaging provides a couple of important features. One feature involves protecting past messages: via \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy\" target=\"_blank\">forward secrecy</a>,\u201d even if keys are stolen today, past messages are still secure. The other involves protecting future messages: via \u201c<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536374\" target=\"_blank\">post-compromise security</a>,\u201d even a compromised system can heal by generating new keys and thus locking an intruder out of future communications. Amigo retains both features.  </p><p>\u201cWe add [our new protections] to the classic forward secrecy and post-compromise security,\u201d Jois says. \u201cBut maybe there are more properties that we need from a security perspective. So I think juggling all of those will be fun.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dbarrada/\" target=\"_blank\">Diogo Baradas</a>, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Canada, adds that Amigo could find applications beyond political protests.</p><p>\u201cAnother scenario where such crowd dynamics are of particular interest include natural disaster scenarios\u2014 like flooding, fires, and earthquakes\u2014where Internet communications may become unavailable,\u201d says Baradas, who is not on the Amigo team. \u201cAnd affected citizens, first-responders, and volunteers must coordinate to ensure a fitting response.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An illustration of simulated versus organic movement.

She\u2019s been investigating the \u201crandom walk\u201d-style approach to modeling crowds in most mesh network environments.</p><p>Like nitrogen and oxygen molecules in a sample of air, individual mesh nodes today are typically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_waypoint_model\" target=\"_blank\">imagined to each trace random paths</a> whose motions are uncorrelated to nearby nodes. <span>If this, Ruiz says, is how mesh networks mathematically model crowd behavior, then </span><span>no wonder</span><span> </span><span>mesh networks seize up in certain real-world environments. </span></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no understanding of the way that protesters are physically moving in these mass civil protests,\u201d Ruiz says of traditional mesh models of crowd behavior. \u201cAnd without having that understanding of the way that people move and what drives the movement, what it looks like on any level, it\u2019s going to be nearly impossible to develop a really tailored solution.\u201d</p><p>So instead, Ruiz is exploring ways to bring models of what she calls psychological crowds into mesh network algorithms. She <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEatax_cbKA&amp;list=PLlg8We3ePxcPG0FRTcEEdsViRevFjikIU&amp;index=8&amp;t=35951s\" target=\"_blank\">described this work</a> in August at the <a href=\"https://schedule.hope.net/hope16/schedule/#2025-08-16\" target=\"_blank\">Hackers on Planet Earth conference</a> in Queens, N.Y. </p><p>\u201cPsychological crowds are a concentration of people in a place that have a certain shared sense of self,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that shared sense of self can directly impact the way that people move. They tend to move closer together. They don\u2019t tolerate as much distance being put in between one another. They move slower.\u201d</p><p>Jois says developing more realistic mathematical models of psychological crowds is a cross-disciplinary effort. It\u2019s part math, and it\u2019s part sociology and group psychology. <span>\u201c[Ruiz\u2019s] current work is about determining communications dynamics and [group] dynamics by going to protest activists and journalists\u2014in these places where internet shutdowns are common\u2014and figuring out what are their needs,\u201d he says.</span></p><p><span>\u201cSince mesh is so heavily impacted by physical movement and traffic patterns,\u201d Ruiz adds, \u201cHaving a strong understanding is key to furthering Amigo and other future mesh messaging tools.\u201d </span></p><p>Jois adds that Amigo drew as inspiration for its crowd models a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UROUN37_gUqrDd4FYDFYXQAmYuXtsBAfaDLo47Im-Kk/edit#heading=h.9n9f9eiq3xhs\" target=\"_blank\">document</a> created in 2019 by Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters, advising fellow activists how to march and gather.

The problem is, you can\u2019t use them all at once. If you did, you would create hot spots\u2014high temperatures concentrated in tiny areas\u2014with power densities nearing those found at the surface of the sun. This has led to a frustrating paradox known as dark silicon, a term coined by computer architects to describe the growing portion of a chip that must be kept powered down. Up to 80 percent of the transistors on a modern chip must remain \u201cdark\u201d at any given moment to keep the chip from sizzling. We are building supercomputers on a sliver of silicon but only using a fraction of their potential. It\u2019s like building a skyscraper and being able to use only the first 10 floors.</p><p>For years, the industry has battled this thermal limit with bigger fans and more complex liquid cooling systems. But these are fundamentally Band-Aid solutions. Whether using air or liquid, they rely on pulling heat away from the chip\u2019s surface. The heat must first conduct through the silicon to the cooling plate, creating a thermal bottleneck that simply cannot be overcome at the power densities of future chips. Hot spots on today\u2019s chips produce tens of watts per square millimeter, and they pop up in various places on the chip at different times during computations. Air and liquid cooling struggle to focus their efforts at just the hot spots, when and where they appear\u2014they can only try to cool the whole thing en masse.</p><p>We at St. Paul, Minn.\u2013based startup Maxwell Labs are proposing a radical new approach: What if, instead of just moving heat, you could make it disappear? The technology, which we call photonic cooling, is capable of converting heat directly into light\u2014cooling the chip from the inside out. The energy can then be recovered and recycled back into useful electric power. With this approach, instead of cooling the whole chip uniformly, we can target hot spots as they form, with laser precision. Fundamentally, this technique could cool hot spots of thousands of watts per square millimeter, orders of magnitude better than today\u2019s chips are cooled.</p><h2>The Physics of Cooling With Light</h2><p>Lasers are usually thought of as sources of heat, and for good reason\u2014they are most commonly used for cutting materials or transferring data. But under the right circumstances, laser light can induce cooling. The secret lies in a luminescent process known as fluorescence.</p><p>Fluorescence is the phenomenon behind the familiar glow of highlighter markers, coral reefs, and white clothes under black-light illumination. These materials absorb high-energy light\u2014usually in the ultraviolet\u2014and reemit lower energy light, often in the visible spectrum. Because they absorb higher energy than they emit, the difference often results in heating up the material. However, under certain, very niche conditions, the opposite can happen: A material can absorb low-energy photons and emit higher-energy light, cooling down in the process.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A stack of squares on top of a layered cube with arrows pointing at the squares from the top. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0e294\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-stack-of-squares-on-top-of-a-layered-cube-with-arrows-pointing-at-the-squares-from-the-top.png?id=61755825&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">To cool computer chips with lasers, the team at Maxwell Labs plans to place a grid of photonic cold plates on top of the chip substrate. In their demo setup, a thermal camera detects hot spots coming from the chip. A laser then shines onto the photonic cold plate next to the hot spot, stimulating the photonic process that results in cooling. The photonic cold plate [inset] consists of a coupler that guides light in and out of the plate, the extractor where anti-Stokes fluorescence occurs, the back reflector that prevents light from entering the computer chip, and a sensor that is designed to detect hot spots.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">GygInfographics.com</small></p><p>The reemission is higher energy because it combines the energy from the incoming photons with phonons, vibrations in the crystal lattice of a material. This phenomenon is called anti-Stokes cooling, and it was first <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/377500a0\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated</a> in a solid back in 1995 when a team of scientists cooled an ytterbium-doped fluoride glass sample with laser light.</p><p>The choice of ytterbium as a dopant was not random: Anti-Stokes cooling works only under carefully engineered conditions. The absorbing material must be structured so that for nearly every absorbed photon a higher-energy photon will be emitted. Otherwise, other mechanisms will kick in, heating rather than cooling the sample. Ions of ytterbium and other such lanthanides have the right structure of electron orbitals to facilitate this process. For a narrow range of laser wavelengths shining on the material, the ions can effectively absorb the incident light and use phonons to trigger emission of higher-energy light. This reemitted, extracted thermal light needs to escape the material quickly enough to not be absorbed again, which would otherwise cause heating.</p><p>To date, lab-based approaches have <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c00116\" target=\"_blank\">achieved</a> up to 90 watts of cooling power in ytterbium-doped silica glass. As impressive as that is, to achieve the transformative effects on high-performance chips that we anticipate, we need to boost the cooling capacity by many orders of magnitude. Achieving this requires integration of the photonic cooling mechanism onto a thin-film, chip-scale photonic cold plate. Miniaturization not only enables more precise spatial targeting of hot spots due to the tightly focused beam, but is a crucial element for pushing the physics of laser cooling toward high-power and high-efficiency regimes. The thinner layer also makes it less likely that the light will get reabsorbed before escaping the film, avoiding heating. And, by engineering the materials at the scale of the wavelength of light, it allows for increased absorption of the incoming laser beam.</p><h2>Photonic Cold-Plate Technology</h2><p>In our lab, we are developing a way to harness photonic cooling to tackle the heat from today\u2019s and future CPUs and GPUs. Our photonic cold plate is designed to sense areas of increasing power density (emerging hot spots) and then couple light efficiently into a nearby region that cools the hot spots down to a target temperature.</p><p>The photonic cold plate has several components: first the coupler, which couples the incoming laser light into the other components; then, the microrefrigeration region, where the cooling actually happens; next, the back reflector, which prevents light from hitting the CPU or GPU directly; and last a sensor, which detects the hot spots as they form.</p><p>The laser shines onto the targeted area from above through the coupler: a kind of lens that focuses the incoming laser light onto a microrefrigeration region. The coupler simultaneously channels the inbound heat-carrying fluorescent light out of the chip. The microrefrigeration region, which we call the extractor, is where the real magic happens: The specially doped thin film undergoes anti-Stokes fluorescence.</p><p>To prevent the incoming laser light and fluorescent light from entering the actual chip and heating the electronics, the photonic cold plate incorporates a back reflector.</p><p>Crucially, cooling occurs only when, and where, the laser is shining onto the cold plate. By choosing where to shine the laser, we can target hot spots as they appear on the chip. The cold plate includes a thermal sensor that detects hot spots, allowing us to steer the laser toward them.</p><p>Designing this whole stack is a complex, interconnected problem with many adjustable parameters, including the exact shape of the coupler, the material and doping level of the extraction region, and the thickness and number of layers in the back reflector. To optimize the cold plate, we are deploying a multiphysics simulation model combined with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-018-0246-9\" target=\"_blank\">inverse design tools</a> that let us search the vast set of possible parameters. We are leveraging these tools in the hope of improving cooling power densities by two orders of magnitude, and we are planning larger simulations to achieve bigger improvements still.</p><p>Collaborating with our partners at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, we are building a demonstration version of photonic cooling at our lab in St. Paul. We are assembling an array of small photonic cold plates, each a square millimeter in size, tiled atop various CPUs. For demonstration purposes, we use an external thermal camera to sense the hot spots coming from the chips. When a hot spot begins to appear, a laser is directed onto the photonic cold plate tile directly atop it, extracting its heat. Our first iteration of the cold plate used ytterbium ion doping, but we are now experimenting with a variety of other dopants that we believe will achieve much higher performance.</p><p>In an upcoming integrated implementation of this demo, the photonic cold plates will consist of finer tiles\u2014about 100 by 100 micrometers. Instead of a free-space laser, light from a fiber will be routed to these tiles by an on-chip photonic network. Which tiles are activated by the laser light will depend on where and when hot spots form, as measured by the sensor.</p><p>Eventually, we hope to collaborate with CPU and GPU manufacturers to integrate the photonic cold plates within the same package as the chip itself, allowing us to get the crucial extractor layer closer to the hot spots and increase the cooling capacity of the device.</p><h2>The Laser-Cooled Chip and the Data Center </h2><p><span>To understand the impact of our photonic cooling technology on current and future data centers, we have performed an analysis of the thermodynamics of laser cooling combined with and compared to air and liquid cooling approaches. Preliminary results show that even a first-generation laser-cooling setup can dissipate twice the power of purely air and liquid cooling systems. This drastic improvement in cooling capability would allow for several key changes to chip and data-center architectures of the future.</span></p><p>First, laser cooling could eliminate the dark-silicon problem. By sufficiently removing heat from hot spots as they are forming, photonic cooling would permit simultaneous operation of more of the transistors on a chip. That would mean all the functional units on a chip could function in parallel, bringing the full force of modern transistor densities to bear.</p><p>Second, laser cooling can allow for much higher clocking frequencies than is currently possible. This cooling technique can maintain the chip\u2019s temperature below 50 \u00b0C <em><em>everywhere, </em></em>because it targets hot spots. Current-generation chips typically experience hot spots in the 90-to-120 \u00b0C range, and this is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_self\">expected only to get worse</a>. The ability to overcome this bottleneck would allow for higher clocking frequencies on the same chips. This opens up the possibility of improving chip performance without directly increasing transistor densities, giving much needed headroom for Moore\u2019s Law to continue to progress.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A black box with optics and a chip on top, and a camera showing a colorful blob above it. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"82d47\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-box-with-optics-and-a-chip-on-top-and-a-camera-showing-a-colorful-blob-above-it.png?id=61756057&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The demo setup at Maxwell Labs demonstrates how current computer chips can be cooled with lasers. A photonic cold plate is placed on top of the chip. A thermal camera images the hot spots coming from the chip, and a laser is directed at the photonic cold plate directly above the hot spot.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Maxwell Labs</small></p><p>Third, this technology makes 3D integration thermally manageable. Because laser-assisted cooling pinpoints the hot spots, it can more readily remove heat from a 3D stack in a way that today\u2019s cooling tech can\u2019t. Adding a photonic cold plate to each layer in a 3D integrated stack would take care of cooling the whole stack, making 3D chip design much more straightforward.</p><p> Fourth, laser cooling is more efficient than air cooling systems. An even more tantalizing result of the removal of heat from hot spots is the ability to keep the chip at a uniform temperature and greatly reduce the overall power consumption of convective cooling systems. Our calculations show that, when combined with air cooling, reductions in overall energy consumption of more than 50 percent for current generation chips are possible, and significantly larger savings would be achieved for future chips.</p><p>What\u2019s more, laser cooling allows for recovering a much higher fraction of waste energy than is possible with air or liquid cooling. Recirculating hot liquid or air to heat nearby houses or other facilities is possible in certain locations and climates, but the recycling efficiency of these approaches is limited. With photonic cooling, the light emitted via anti-Stokes fluorescence can be recovered by re-collecting the light into fiber-optic cables and then converting it to electricity through thermophotovoltaics, leading to upwards of 60 percent energy recovery.</p><p>With this fundamentally new approach to cooling, we can rewrite the rules by which chips and data centers are designed. We believe this could be what enables the continuation of Moore\u2019s Law, as well as the power savings at the data-center level that could greenlight the intelligence explosion we\u2019re starting to see today.</p><h2>The Path to Photonic Cooling</h2><p>While our results are highly promising, several challenges remain before this technology can become a commercial reality. The materials we are currently using for our photonic cold plates meet basic requirements, but continued development of higher efficiency laser-cooling materials will improve system performance and make this an increasingly economically attractive proposition. To date, only a handful of materials have been studied and made pure enough to allow laser cooling. We believe that miniaturization of the photonic cold plate, aided by progress in optical engineering and thin-film materials processing, will have similarly transformative effects on this technology as it has for the transistor, solar cells, and lasers.</p><p> We\u2019re going to need to codesign the processors, packages, and cooling systems to maximize benefits. This will require close collaboration across the traditionally siloed semiconductor ecosystem. We are working with industry partners to try to facilitate this codesign process.</p><p>Transitioning from a lab-based setup to high-volume commercial manufacturing will require us to develop efficient processes and specialized equipment. Industry-wide adoption necessitates new standards for optical interfaces, safety protocols, and performance metrics.</p><p>Although there is much to be done, we do not see any fundamental obstacles now to the large-scale adoption of photonic cooling technology. In our current vision, we anticipate the early adoption of the technology in high-performance computing and AI training clusters before 2027, showing an order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt of cooling. Then, between 2028 and 2030, we hope to see mainstream data-center deployment, with an accompanied reduction in IT energy consumption of 40 percent while doubling compute capacity. Finally, after 2030 we foresee that ubiquitous deployment, from hyperscale to edge, will enable new computing paradigms limited only by algorithmic efficiency rather than thermal constraints.</p><p>For over two decades, the semiconductor industry has grappled with the looming threat of dark silicon. Photonic cooling offers not merely a solution to that challenge but a fundamental reimagining of the relationship between performance, computation, and energy. By converting waste heat directly into useful photons and ultimately back into electricity, this technology transforms thermal management from a necessary evil into a valuable resource.</p><p>The future of computing is photonic, efficient, and brilliantly cool. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

As a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/technology-sustainable-climate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization</a>, she shares her knowledge about energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and ozone-layer recovery.</p><p>\u201cFor a woman to succeed, she needs a lot of family support,\u201d Thomas says, because many women\u2019s careers are interrupted by caretaking and child-rearing responsibilities. She acknowledges that not all women have the same support system she has\u2014which is part of the reason why she is dedicated to helping others succeed.</p><h2>A passion for teaching</h2><p>Thomas was born and raised in Kerala, India. Kerala students who excelled at school were expected to choose a career in either medicine or engineering, she says. Medicine wasn\u2019t an option for her, she says, because she faints at the sight of blood. She was good at mathematics, though, so she chose to pursue engineering.</p><p>Although both her parents were teachers (her father taught chemistry; her mother was a language instructor), she wasn\u2019t inspired to pursue a similar path until she was an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://keralauniversity.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Kerala</a>. Her extensive note-taking during class made her popular among her classmates, she says, and some would ask her to tutor them during exam season.</p><p>\u201cMy friends would come over to my home so I could explain the material to them using my notes,\u201d she says. \u201cAfterward, they would tell me that they were able to understand the subject much better than how the professor had explained it. That\u2019s what inspired me to become a teacher.\u201d</p><p>After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1984, Thomas continued her education at the <a href=\"https://www.iitm.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>. Shortly after earning her master\u2019s of technology in electrical engineering in 1986, she began her first teaching job at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, also in Kerala.</p><p>The year was a whirlwind for Thomas, who got married, left her job, and moved to New Delhi, where her husband lived. Instead of searching for another teaching job, she decided to pursue a doctoral degree in the electrical engineering program at the <a href=\"https://www.iitd.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi</a>.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I was 28, I had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which I earned in 1990,\u201d she says. \u201cI soon got a job at Delhi Technological University, the only other college in New Delhi that had an engineering school at that time, other than IIT. From there, I never looked back.\u201d</p><p>She taught at the university for five years, then left in 1995 to join Jamia Millia Islamia. She eventually was promoted to lead the electrical engineering department.</p><p>During her 11 years there, she established labs to conduct research in supervisory control and data acquisition (<a href=\"https://inductiveautomation.com/resources/article/what-is-scada\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SCADA</a>) and substation automation, collaborating with industry on projects. In 2003 she created a curriculum for\u2014and led the launch of\u2014a master\u2019s of technology program in electrical power system management as well as a training program for industry professionals. For her work, she received a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/awards/meritorious-award\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities Board Meritorious Achievement Award</a>.</p><p>In 2014 she founded the school\u2019s <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/cie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a> to help startups turn their ideas into prototypes and launch businesses.</p><p>She received an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse in 2016: become president of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli.</p><p>\u201cThis was a great honor to become the first woman president of that institute,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the only woman among 90 presidents of all the institutions of national importance at that time.\u201d</p><p>But, she says, as president, she didn\u2019t have much time to teach, and after five years, she began to miss her time in the classroom. After her five-year term was completed, she returned to Jamia Millia Islamia in 2021 as engineering dean. Since then, she has led the launch of five programs: three undergraduate programs (in data science, electrical and computer engineering, and VLSI) and graduate programs in data science and environmental sciences.</p><p>This year she stepped down after completing her three-year term as dean and is focusing more on teaching.</p><p>She teaches at least one class each semester because, she says, she finds joy in \u201cimparting and giving knowledge to young minds.\u201d</p><h2>Mentoring women in the power industry</h2><p>Thomas mentors doctoral students as well as professors who aspire to serve as deans or other high-level positions.</p><p>In addition, she trains mid-career women in the power industry on the skills they need to get promoted\u2014to technical and senior management roles\u2014through the <a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/the-wepowernetwork.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">South Asia WePOWER network</a>\u2019s South Asia Region (SAR) 100 professional development program.

Thomas is one of 40 experts who remotely teach topics such as transmission details, distribution, renewable energy, and the importance of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-updates-2025\" target=\"_self\">women in leadership</a>.</p><p>She also mentors women to give them confidence and tools to reach leadership positions because \u201cmentorship is what changed my career trajectory,\u201d she says. When she first began teaching, she says she was reluctant to take high-level positions. But after participating in a six-day leadership training at the <a href=\"https://www.jnu.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a>, which was hosted by the Government of India\u2019s <a href=\"https://ugc.gov.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University Grants Commission</a>, she felt confident in her ability to move up the career ladder.</p><p>\u201cMany women take a break from their careers to raise their children, struggle to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/work-life-balance\" target=\"_self\">balance their personal and professional lives</a>, or don\u2019t have a support system,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to impart the lessons I learned from my experiences and the training I received. Whenever I get a chance, I get involved.\u201d</p><h2>Creating lifelong friendships and mentoring students</h2><p>Thomas joined IEEE in 1990 as a graduate student member and says she continues renewing her membership to stay up to date on emerging technologies, specifically SCADA systems.</p><p>\u201cI learned everything about SCADA from a tutorial developed by the <a href=\"https://ieee-pes.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Power & Energy Society</a>. There was no such material available at that time,\u201d she says.</p><p>Years later, in 2015, Thomas cowrote <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/power-system-scada-and-smart-grids-mini-s-thomas/1133718207\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Power System SCADA and Smart Grids</em></em></a> with her friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndougmcdonald\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John McDonald</a>, whom she met through the organization. McDonald is an IEEE Life Fellow and the founder and CEO of JDM Associates in Duluth, Ga.</p><p>Thomas became an active volunteer for the <a href=\"https://www.ieeedtu.in/IEEEDTU/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delhi Technological University\u2019s student branch</a>, where she helped organize technical talks and other events. When Thomas joined Jamia Millia Islamia, she revived the inactive <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/company/ieeejmi-sb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">student branch</a> there and served as its counselor for 14 years.</p><p>During her 35 years with IEEE, she has served as chair of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities/regional-list-region-10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Region 10</a> student activities committee and vice chair of membership development for <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities</a>.

The 620 words are included in the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Thesaurus</a>, which defines almost 12,500 engineering, technical, and scientific terms. Now she is working with a team to expand the taxonomy by defining hundreds more climate-change terms.</p><p>\u201cYou should always do what you enjoy. For me, that\u2019s teaching and volunteering with IEEE,\u201d she says. \u201cI could just be a member, access the technical content, and be happy with just that, but I volunteer because I can do things that help others.\u201d</p>"

This compact, open-source model can handle massive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-context-window\" target=\"_blank\">context windows</a> of 250,000 tokens (meaning that it can \u201cremember\u201d and reason over much more text than typical language models) and can run at high speed, even on consumer devices. The launch highlights a growing shift: smaller, more efficient models could shape the future of AI just as much as raw scale. </p><p>\u201cWe believe in a more decentralized future for AI\u2014one where not everything runs in massive data centers,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ori-goshen/\" target=\"_blank\">Ori Goshen</a>, Co-CEO of AI21, in an interview with <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>. \u201cLarge models will still play a role, but small, powerful models running on devices will have a significant impact\u201d on both the future and the economics of AI, he says. Jamba is built for developers who want to create edge-AI applications and specialized systems that run efficiently on-device.</p><p>AI21\u2019s Jamba Reasoning 3B is designed to handle long sequences of text and challenging tasks like math, coding, and logical reasoning\u2014all while running with impressive speed on everyday devices like laptops and mobile phones. Jamba Reasoning 3B can also work in a hybrid setup: Simple jobs are handled locally by the device, while heavier problems get sent to powerful cloud servers. According to AI21, this smarter routing could dramatically cut AI infrastructure costs for certain workloads\u2014potentially by an order of magnitude.</p><h2>A Small but Mighty LLM</h2><p>With 3 billion parameters, Jamba Reasoning 3B is tiny by today\u2019s AI standards. Models like GPT-5 or Claude run well past 100 billion parameters, and even smaller models, such as Llama 3 (8B) or Mistral (7B), are more than twice the size of AI21\u2019s model, Goshen notes.</p><p>That compact size makes it more remarkable that AI21\u2019s model can handle a context window of 250,000 tokens on consumer devices. <span>Some proprietary models, like GPT-5, offer even longer context windows, but Jamba sets a new high-water mark among open-source models. The previous open-model</span><span> record of 128,000 tokens </span><span>was held by </span><span>Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2 (3B), Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 Mini, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepseek\" target=\"_blank\">DeepSeek R1</a>, which are all much larger models. </span><span>Jamba Reasoning 3B can process more than 17 tokens per second even when working at full capacity</span><span>\u2014that is, with</span><span> extremely long inputs that use its full 250,000-token context window. Many other models slow down or struggle once their input length exceeds 100,000 tokens.</span></p><p>Goshen explains that the model is built on an architecture called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887\" target=\"_blank\">Jamba</a>, which combines two types of neural network designs: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a> layers, familiar from other large language models, and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mamba-model\" target=\"_blank\">Mamba</a> layers, which are designed to be more memory-efficient. This hybrid design enables the model to handle long documents, large codebases, and other extensive inputs directly on a laptop or phone\u2014using about one-tenth the memory of traditional transformers. Goshen says the model runs much faster than traditional transformers because it relies less on a memory component called the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249\" target=\"_blank\">KV cache</a>, which can slow down processing as inputs get longer. </p><h2>Why Small LLMs Are Needed</h2><p>The model\u2019s hybrid architecture gives it an advantage in both speed and memory efficiency, even with very long inputs, confirms a software engineer who works in the LLM industry.

Then a pattern is made, the fabric is chosen and cut, and the garment is sewed. Finally the clothing is packaged and shipped.</p><p>To expedite the process, some apparel companies now use 3D technologies including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/augmented-reality-consumers-customize-products\" target=\"_self\">design software</a>, <a href=\"https://sagroups.ieee.org/ic15-004/home/ic-groups/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">body scans</a>, visualization, and 3D <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printing-smart-objects\" target=\"_self\">printers</a>. The tools allow designers to envision their creations in a variety of colors, fabrics, and motifs. Avatars known as <em><em>digital twins</em></em> are created to simulate how the clothes will look and fit on different body types. Body scans generate measurements for better-fitting clothing and improved product design.</p><p>Some manufacturers incorporate artificial intelligence to streamline operations, and additional companies likely will explore it as it becomes more accurate.</p><p>Not all garment makers are utilizing 3D technologies to their fullest potential, however.</p><p>To advance 3D technology for designers, manufacturers, and retailers, the <a href=\"https://3drc.pi.tv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3D Retail Coalition</a> holds an annual challenge that spotlights academic institutions and startups that are leading the way. The contest is cosponsored by the <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/industry-connections/activities/3d-body-processing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Standards Association Industry Connections 3D Body Processing</a> program, which works with the clothing industry to create standards for technology that uses 3D scans to create digital models.</p><p>The winners of this year\u2019s contest were selected in June at the <a href=\"https://apparel.pi.tv/events/175\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PI Apparel Fashion Tech Show</a>, held in New York City.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.fitnyc.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fashion Institute of Technology</a> (FIT) placed first in the academic category. The New York City school offers programs in design, fashion, art, communications, and business.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pixascale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PixaScale</a> won the startup category. Based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, the consultancy assists fashion and consumer goods companies with automating content, managing 3D digital assets, and improving workflows.</p><h2>Custom-made clothing by 3D and AI</h2><p>Ill-fitting garments, shoes, and accessories are problems for clothing companies. The average <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/media/clothing-return-rates-by-category-and-country-csf-a/#:~:text=Global%20Overview,in%20the%20region%20at%2022%2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">return rate worldwide for clothing ordered online is more than 25 percent</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PrimeAI</a>.</p><p>To make ready-to-wear clothing, designers use grading, a process that takes an initial sample pattern of a base size using established standards and 3D body scans, then makes smaller and larger versions to be mass-produced. But the resulting clothes do not fit everyone.</p><p>Returns, which can be frustrating for shoppers, are costly for clothing companies due to reshipping and restocking expenses.</p><p>Some customers can\u2019t be bothered to send back unwanted items, and they throw them in the garbage, where they end up in landfills.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we could go back to the days when you would go to a shop, get measured, and someone would custom-make your garment?\u201d posits <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-lavange-b0358a15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh LaVange</a>, an assistant professor of technical design and patternmaking at FIT.</p><p>That was the idea behind LaVange\u2019s winning project, Automated Custom Sizing. Her proposal uses 3D technology and AI to produce custom-tailored clothing on demand for all body types. She outlined short- and long-term scalable solutions in her submission.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d <strong>\u2014Leigh LaVange</strong></p><p>\u201cI see it [custom sizing] as a solution that can be automated and eventually rolled out across all different types of brands,\u201d she says.</p><p>The short-term proposal involves measuring a person\u2019s base body specifications, such as bust, waist, thighs, biceps, and hips\u2014either manually or from a 3D body scan. An avatar of the customer is then created and entered into a database preloaded with 3D representations of various sizes of the sample garment. The AI program notes the customer\u2019s specs and the existing sizes to determine the best fit. If, for example, the person\u2019s chest matches the medium-size dimensions but the hips are a few millimeters larger, the program still might recommend medium because it determined the material around the hips had enough excess fabric. A rendering of an avatar wearing an item is shown to customers to help them decide whether to make the purchase.</p><p>LaVange says her solution will help improve customer satisfaction and minimize returns.</p><p>Her long-term plan is a truly customized fit. Using 3D body scans, an AI program would determine the necessary adjustments to the pattern based on the customer\u2019s specifications and critical fit points, like the waist, while preserving the original design. The 3D system then would make alterations, which would be rendered on the customer\u2019s avatar for approval. The solution would eliminate excess inventory, LaVange says, because the clothing would be custom-made.</p><p>Because her proposals rely on technologies not currently used by the industry and a different way of interacting with customers, a shift in production would be required, she says.</p><p>\u201cMost manufacturing systems today are set up to produce as many units as possible in a single day,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a way to produce garments efficiently if you set up your manufacturing facility correctly. I want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d</p><h2>A digital asset management platform</h2><p>The winning submission in the startup category, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhl20Qr4Ss\" target=\"_blank\">AI-First DAM [digital asset management] as an Intelligent Backbone for Agile Product Development</a>, uses 3D technology and AI to combine components of clothing design into a centralized platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristian-sons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kristian Sons</a>, chief executive of Pixascale, launched the startup in February. He left <a href=\"https://www.adidas.com/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adidas</a> in January after nine years at the company, where he was the technical lead for digital creation.</p><p>Many apparel companies, Sons says, still store their 3D files on employees\u2019 local drives or on Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint</a>, a Web-based document-management system.</p><p>Those methods make things difficult because not everyone has access.</p><p>Sons\u2019 cloud-based platform addresses the issue by sharing digital assets, such as images, videos, 3D models, base styles, and documents, to all parties involved in the process.</p><p>That includes designers, seamstresses, and manufacturers. His system integrates with the client\u2019s file management system, providing access to the most recent images, renderings, and other relevant data.</p><p>His DAM system also includes a library of embellishments such as zippers and buttons, as well as fabric options.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and can understand what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration.\u201d <strong>\u2014Kristian Sons</strong></p><p>\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and track what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration,\u201d he says.</p><p>Sons also is working on incorporating <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-economy\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> and large language models to connect with internal systems and application programming interfaces to autonomously conduct simple research requests.</p><p>That might include suggesting new products or different silhouettes, or modifying the previous season\u2019s offerings with new colors, Sons says.</p><p>\u201cThese AI agents certainly will not be perfect, but they are a good starting point so designers don\u2019t have to start from scratch,\u201d he says. \u201cI think using AI agents is super exciting because in the past few years in the fashion industry, we have been talking about how AI would do the creative parts, like designing a product.

What works as a lab-bench mockup breaks in reality. Harnessing and safely storing energy at grid scale and in cars, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-trucks'\" target=\"_self\">trucks</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-air-taxi-industry\" target=\"_self\">planes</a> is a very hard problem that simplified models sometimes can\u2019t touch. <strong></strong></p><p><span>\u201cIn electrification, at its core, you have this combination of electromagnetic effects, heat transfer, and structural mechanics in a complicated interplay,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/blogs/author/bjorn-sjodin/\" target=\"_blank\">Bjorn Sjodin</a><span>, senior vice president of product management at the Stockholm-based software company </span><a href=\"https://comsol.com/\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL</a><span>. </span></p><p>COMSOL is an engineering R&amp;D software company that seeks to simulate not just a single phenomenon\u2014for instance, the electromagnetic behavior of a circuit\u2014but rather <em>all</em> the pertinent physics that needs to be simulated for developing new technologies in real-world operating conditions. </p><p><span>Engineers and developers gathered in Burlington, Mass. on 8 to 10 October for COMSOL\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/conference/boston\" target=\"_blank\">annual Boston conference</a><span>, where they discussed engineering simulations via multiple simultaneous physics packages. And </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/comsol\" target=\"_self\">multiphysics modeling</a><span>, as the emerging field is called, has emerged as a component of electrification R&amp;D that is becoming more than just nice to have.</span></p><p>\u201cSometimes, I think some people still see simulation as a fancy R&amp;D thing,\u201d says <span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/niloofar-kamyab-ph-d-0a200b10a/\" target=\"_blank\">Niloofar Kamyab</a></span>, a chemical engineer and applications manager at COMSOL. \u201cBecause they see it as a replacement for experiments. But no, experiments still need to be done, though experiments can be done in a more optimized and effective way.\u201d</p><h3>Can Multiphysics Scale Electrification?</h3><p>Multiphysics, Kamyab says, can sometimes be only half the game.</p><p>\u201cI think when it comes to batteries, there is another attraction when it comes to simulation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s multi<em>scale</em>\u2014how batteries can be studied across different <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_self\">scales</a>. You can get in-depth analysis that, if not very hard, I would say is impossible to do experimentally.\u201d</p><p>In part, this is because batteries reveal complicated behaviors (and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-ion-battery-fires\" target=\"_blank\">runaway reactions</a>) at the cell level but also in unpredictable new ways at the battery-pack level as well. <strong></strong></p><p>\u201cMost of the people who do simulations of battery packs\u2014thermal management is one of their primary concerns,\u201d Kamyab says. \u201cYou do this simulation so you know how to avoid it. You recreate a cell that is malfunctioning.\u201d She adds that multiphysics simulation of thermal runaway enables battery engineers to safely test how each design behaves in even the most extreme conditions\u2014in order to stop any battery problems or fires before they could happen. </p><p>Wireless charging systems are another area of electrification, with their own thermal challenges<span>.</span><span> \u201cAt higher power levels, localized heating of the coil changes its conductivity,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://www.veryst.com/about/our-team/nirmal-paudel\" target=\"_blank\">Nirmal Paudel</a><span>, a lead engineer at </span><a href=\"https://www.veryst.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Veryst Engineering</a><span>, a consulting firm based in Needham, Mass. And that, he notes, in turn can change the entire circuit as well as the design and performance of all the elements that surround it.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-motor\" target=\"_self\">Electric motors</a> and power converters require similar simulation savvy. <span>According to electrical engineer and COMSOL senior application engineer </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vigneshwaran-gurusamy/\" target=\"_blank\">Vignesh Gurusamy</a><span>, older ways of developing these age-old electrical workhorse technologies are proving less useful today. </span><span>\u201cThe recent surge in electrification across diverse applications demands a more holistic approach as it enables the development of new optimal designs,\u201d Gurusamy says.</span><span></span></p><p>And freight transportation: <span>\u201cFor trucks, people are investigating, </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mobile-bess\" target=\"_self\">Should we use batteries</a><span>? </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hydrogen-truck\" target=\"_self\">Should we use fuel cells</a><span>?\u201d Sjodin says. \u201cFuel cells are very multiphysics friendly\u2014fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reactions, and electrochemical reactions.\u201d</span></p><p><span>Lastly, there\u2019s the electric grid itself. </span><span>\u201cThe grid is designed for a continuous supply of power,\u201d Sjodin says. \u201cSo when you have power sources [like wind and solar] shutting off and on all the time, you have completely new problems.\u201d <strong></strong></span></p><h3>Multiphysics in Battery and Electric-Motor Design</h3><p>Taking such an all-in approach to engineering simulations can yield unanticipated upsides as well, says Kamyab. <span>Berlin-based automotive engineering company </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAV_GmbH\" target=\"_blank\">IAV</a>, for example,<span> is developing power-train systems that integrate multiple battery formats and chemistries in a single pack. </span><span>\u201c</span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/natron-sodium-ion-battery-failure\" target=\"_blank\">Sodium ion</a><span> cannot give you the energy that </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-battery\" target=\"_blank\">lithium ion</a><span> can give,\u201d Kamyab says. \u201cSo they came up with a blend of chemistries, to get the benefits of each, and then designed a thermal management that matches all the chemistries.\u201d</span></p><p>Jakob Hilgert, who works as a technical consultant at IAV, recently contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/story/driving-ev-development-with-a-twin-battery-approach-140391\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL industry case study</a>. In it, Hilgert described the design of a dual-chemistry battery pack that combines sodium-ion cells with a more costly lithium solid-state battery.</p><p>Hilgert says that using multiphysics simulation enabled the IAV team to play the two chemistries\u2019 different properties off of each other. \u201cIf we have some cells that can operate at high temperatures and some cells that can operate at low temperatures, it is beneficial to take the exhaust heat of the higher-running cells to heat up the lower-running cells, and vice versa,\u201d Hilgert said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we came up with a cooling system that shifts the energy from cells that want to be in a cooler state to cells that want to be in a hotter state.\u201d</p><p>According to Sjodin, IAV is part of a larger trend in a range of industries that are impacted by the electrification of everything. <span>\u201cAlgorithmic improvements and hardware improvements multiply together,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the future of multiphysics simulation. It will allow you to simulate larger and larger, more realistic systems.\u201d</span></p><p>According to COMSOL\u2019s Gurusamy, GPU accelerators and surrogate models allow for bigger jumps in electric-motor capabilities and efficiencies. Even seemingly simple components like the windings of copper wire in a motor core (called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/axial-flux\" target=\"_self\">stators</a>) provide parameters that multiphysics can optimize.</p><p>\u201cA primary frontier in electric-motor development is pushing power density and efficiency to new heights, with thermal management emerging as a key challenge,\u201d Gurusamy says. \u201cMultiphysics models that couple electromagnetic and thermal simulations\u2026incorporate temperature-dependent behavior in stator windings and magnetic materials.\u201d</p><p>Simulation is also changing the wireless charging world, Paudel says. \u201cTraditional design cycles tweak coil geometry,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, integrated multiphysics platforms enable exploration of new charging architectures,\u201d including flexible charging textiles and smart surfaces that adapt in real time.</p><p>And batteries, according to Kamyab, are continuing a push toward higher power densities and lower prices. Which is changing not just the industries where batteries are already used, like consumer electronics and EVs. Higher-capacity batteries are also driving new industries like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pivotal-helix\" target=\"_self\">electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft</a> (eVTOLs).</p><p>\u201cThe reason that many ideas that we had 30 years ago are becoming a reality is now we have the batteries to power them,\u201d Kamyab says. \u201cThat was the bottleneck for many years.... And as we continue to push battery technology forward, who knows what new technologies and applications we\u2019re making possible next.\u201d</p>"

You\u2019re faced with a photo of an average U.S. house, maybe two floors with a front lawn in a cul-de-sac and an American flag flying proudly out front. But there\u2019s nothing particularly distinctive about this home, nothing to tell you the state it\u2019s in or where the owners are from.</span></p><p>You have two tools at your disposal: your brain and 44,416 low-resolution, bird\u2019s-eye-view photos of random places across the United States and their associated location data. Could you match the house to an aerial image and locate it correctly? </p><p>I definitely couldn\u2019t, but a new machine learning model likely could. The software, created by researchers at <a href=\"https://upc.cucas.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">China University of Petroleum (East China)</a>, searches a database of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/radar-imaging-monitoring-climate-change\" target=\"_self\">remote-sensing</a> photos with associated location information to match the street-side image\u2014of a home or a commercial building or anything else that can be photographed from a road\u2014to an aerial image in the database. While other systems can do the same, this one is pocket size compared with others and superaccurate. </p><p>At its best (when faced with a picture that has a 180-degree field of view), it succeeds up to 97 percent of the time in the first stage of narrowing down the location. That\u2019s better than or within two percentage points of all the other models available for comparison. Even under less-than-ideal conditions, it performs better than many competitors. When pinpointing an exact location, it\u2019s correct 82 percent of the time, which is within three points of the other models.</p><p>But this model is novel for its speed and memory savings. It is at least twice as fast as similar ones and uses less than a third of the memory they require, according to the researchers. The combination makes it valuable for applications in navigation systems and the defense industry.</p><p>\u201cWe train the AI to ignore the superficial differences in perspective and focus on extracting the same \u2018key landmarks\u2019 from both views, converting them into a simple, shared language,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://renpenghit.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Peng Ren</a>, who develops machine learning and signal-processing algorithms at China University of Petroleum.</p><p>The software relies on a method called deep cross-view hashing. Rather than try to compare each pixel of a street-view picture to every single image in the giant bird\u2019s-eye-view database, this method relies on hashing, which means transforming a collection of data\u2014in this case, street-level and aerial photos\u2014into a string of numbers unique to the data.</p><p>To do that, the university\u2018s research group employs a type of deep-learning model called a vision transformer that splits images into small units and finds patterns among the pieces. The model may find in a photo what it\u2019s been trained to identify as a tall building, circular fountain, or roundabout, and then encodes its findings into number strings. ChatGPT is based on similar architecture, but it finds patterns in text instead of images. (The \u201cT\u201d in \u201cGPT\u201d stands for \u201ctransformer.\u201d)</p><p>The number that represents each picture is like a fingerprint, says <a href=\"https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/\" target=\"_blank\">Hongdong Li</a>, who studies computer vision at Australian National University, in Canberra. The number code captures unique features from each image that allow the geolocation process to quickly narrow down possible matches. </p><p>In the new system, the code associated with a given ground-level photo gets compared with those of all of the aerial images in the database (for testing, the team used satellite images of the United States and Australia), yielding the five closest candidates for aerial matches. Data representing the geography of the closest matches is averaged using a technique that weighs locations closer to each other more heavily to reduce the impact of outliers, and out pops an estimated location of the street-view image.</p><p>The new mechanism for geolocation was published last month in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153558\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</em></em></a>.</p><h2>Fast and memory efficient </h2><p>\u201cThough not a completely new paradigm,\u201d this paper \u201crepresents a clear advance within the field,\u201d Li says. Because this problem has been solved before, some experts, like  computer scientist <a href=\"https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Nathan-Jacobs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Jacobs</a>, of Washington University in St. Louis, are not as excited. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is a particularly groundbreaking paper,\u201d he says. </p><p>But Li disagrees with Jacobs\u2014he thinks this approach is innovative in its use of hashing to make finding images matches faster and more memory efficient than conventional techniques.<span> It uses just 35 megabytes, while the next smallest model Ren\u2019s team examined requires 104 MB, about three times as much space.</span></p><p>The method is more than twice as fast as the next fastest one, the researchers claim. When matching street-level images to a dataset of aerial photography of the United States, the time it took the runner-up to match was around 0.005 seconds. The Petroleum group was able to find a location in around 0.0013 seconds, almost four times as fast.</p><p>\u201cAs a result, our method is more efficient than conventional image geolocalization techniques,\u201d says Ren, and Li confirms that these claims are credible. Hashing \u201cis a well-established route to speed and compactness, and the reported results align with theoretical expectations,\u201d Li says.</p><p>Though these efficiencies seem promising, more work is required to ensure this method will work at scale, Li says. The group did not fully study realistic challenges like seasonal variation or clouds blocking the image, which could impact the robustness of the geolocation matching. Down the line, this limitation can be overcome by introducing images from more distributed locations, Ren says.</p><p>Still, long-term applications (beyond a superadvanced GeoGuessr) are worth considering now, experts say. </p><p>There are some trivial uses for an efficient image geolocation, such as automatically geotagging old family photos, says Jacobs. But on the more serious side, navigation systems could also exploit a geolocation method like this one. If <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/gladys-west-hidden-figure-gps\" target=\"_self\">GPS</a> fails in a self-driving car, another way to quickly and precisely find locations could be useful, Jacobs says. Li also suggests it could play a role in emergency response within the next five years. </p><p>There may also be applications in defense systems. <a href=\"https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/finder\" target=\"_blank\">Finder</a>, a 2011 project from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, aimed to help intelligence analysts learn as much as they could about photos without metadata using reference data from sources including overhead images, a goal that could be accomplished with models similar to this new geolocation method. </p><p><span>Jacobs puts the defense application into context: If a government agency sent a photo of a terrorist training camp without metadata, how can the site be geolocated quickly and efficiently? Deep cross-view hashing might be of some help.</span> </p>"

We assembled in a narrow room. A long table occupied the room\u2019s center. Snacks and sodas were set out along the back wall; the lighting was subdued. The dominant feature of this cramped chamber was a big one-way mirror occupying almost the entire front wall. Sitting at the table, one could see through the looking glass into a wonderland of market research on the other side. In that much larger, brightly lit room were comfortable chairs, an easel with a large pad of paper, and our hired facilitator. Although this was a familiar trope I\u2019d seen a hundred times on TV, actually lurking in an observation room like this felt a touch surreal.</p><h2>iRobot vs Focus Group</h2><p>We\u2019d paid maybe US $10,000 for the privilege of setting up some focus groups\u2014probably the most the company had ever spent on a market research event. But we needed to know how potential customers would react to our Roomba prototype when they saw one in the (plastic) flesh cleaning the floor at their feet. At the appointed hour, our facilitator welcomed eight to 10 bona fide ordinary people as they filed into the large room and sat in the chairs. Our mind-child was about to receive its first critical judgment from strangers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Dancing-with-Roomba-Cracking-the-Robot-Riddle-and-Building-an-Icon/Jones/p/book/9781032890616\"></a><a class=\"shortcode-media-lightbox__toggle shortcode-media-controls__button material-icons\" style=\"background: gray;\" title=\"Select for lightbox\">aspect_ratio</a><img alt=\"Book cover: Roomba with signatures and red dance shoes on wooden floor.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"aa4ad\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/book-cover-roomba-with-signatures-and-red-dance-shoes-on-wooden-floor.jpg?id=61715094&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This article was adapted from the author\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Dancing-with-Roomba-Cracking-the-Robot-Riddle-and-Building-an-Icon/Jones/p/book/9781032890616\" target=\"_blank\">Dancing with Roomba: Cracking the Robot Riddle and Building an Icon</a>  (Routledge 2025).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>The facilitator prepared participants by encouraging them to state their honest views and not to be swayed by the comments of others. \u201cYou are the world\u2019s expert in your own opinion,\u201d she told them.</span></p><p>At first the facilitator described Roomba without showing the group any photos or the device itself. She was met with skepticism that such a thing would actually work. Then she demonstrated one of the prototypes we had prepared for the event. As participants watched Roomba go about its business on both carpets and hard floors, their doubts ebbed. Even those who stated that they would never purchase such a device couldn\u2019t help being intrigued. As the group discussion proceeded, soccer moms (representing \u201cearly mass-market adopters\u201d) emerged as the most interested. They saw Roomba as a time-saver. This surprised and pleased us, as we\u2019d expected the much smaller market of gadget geeks would be the first to fall in love.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Transparent blue Roomba vacuum on wooden floor near a doorway.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2503f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/transparent-blue-roomba-vacuum-on-wooden-floor-near-a-doorway.jpg?id=61715051&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">iRobot built about 20 of its third major Roomba prototype, the T100, all with 3D-printed shells.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p>But we could take neither interest nor love to the bank. We needed to know how much customers would pay. Our facilitator eased into that part of the gathering\u2019s proceedings. She did not inquire directly but rather asked, \u201cIf you saw this product in a store, what would you expect the price to be?\u201d</p><p><span>The focus group\u2019s responses were all over the map. Some people mentioned a price close to the $200 we intended to charge. A few folks we regarded as saints-in-training expected an even higher number. But most were lower. One woman said she\u2019d expect Roomba to be priced at $25. Later when asked what she thought a replacement battery might cost, she said, \u201c$50.\u201d That hurt. For this lady, attaching our robot to a battery devalued the battery.</span></p><h2>Floor Cleaner or Robot?</h2><p>Throughout the proceedings our facilitator had been careful to leave a couple of things unmentioned. First, she never referred to Roomba as a robot, calling it instead an \u201cautomatic floor cleaner.\u201d Three separate groups, comprising an aggregate of around two dozen people, gave their opinions that day. Of these, only two individuals spontaneously applied the term \u201crobot\u201d to Roomba.</p><p>The second unmentioned characteristic was the nature of Roomba\u2019s cleaning mechanism. That is, the facilitator had revealed no details about how it worked. Participants had seen the demo, they observed Roomba cleaning effectively, they had given their opinion about the price. They\u2019d all assumed that a vacuum was at work, several used that term to refer to the robot. But now the facilitator told them, \u201cRoomba is a carpet sweeper, not a vacuum.\u201d Then she asked again what they would expect to pay. On average, focus-group members from all three groups cut their estimates in half. Participants who had previously said $200 now said $100.</p><p>The focus group\u2019s brutal revaluation exploded our world. The enabling innovation that made the energy budget work, that made Roomba technically and economically feasible, was cleaning with a carpet sweeper rather than a vacuum. People had seen that the carpet-sweeper-Roomba really did work. Yet they chose to trust conventional wisdom about vacuums versus carpet sweepers rather than their own apparently lying eyes. If we were forced to cut the robot\u2019s price in half, we would lose money on every unit sold, and there would be no Roomba.</p><p>At the end of the evening, before any member of our stunned team could stagger out the door, Winston said simply, \u201cRoomba has to have a vacuum.\u201d A shotgun wedding was in the offing for bot and vac.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Round white robot with cartoon puppy sticker, named &quot;Scamp,&quot; on a desk.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4d0a6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/round-white-robot-with-cartoon-puppy-sticker-named-scamp-on-a-desk.jpg?id=61715054&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Scamp, the earliest Roomba prototype, was built in 1999.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>The next day at work we gathered to discuss the focus group\u2019s revelation. A half-hearted attempt or two to deny reality quickly faded\u2014electrical engineer Chris Casey saw to that\u2014and we accepted what we needed to do. But changing things now would be a huge challenge in multiple ways. We were deep into development, closer to launch than kickoff. All the electrical power our battery could supply was already spoken for. None was available for a new system that would likely be more power hungry than all the robot\u2019s other systems combined. And where could we put a vacuum? All the space in the robot was also fully assigned. Our mandate to clean under furniture and between chair legs wouldn\u2019t let us make the robot any bigger.</span></p><h2>Making Roomba a Vacuum</h2><p>One escape hatch beckoned, but no one was eager to leap through it. Chris articulated what we were all thinking. \u201cWe could build a vestigial vacuum,\u201d he said. That is, we could design a tiny, pico-power vacuum\u2014one that consumes almost no power and does almost nothing\u2014strap it on the robot, and call it done. Perversely, that seemed reasonable. The robot already cleaned the floor well; our cleaning tests proved it. Customers, however, didn\u2019t know that. They were all steeped in the dogma of vacuum supremacy. Reeducating the masses wasn\u2019t possible\u2014we didn\u2019t have the funds. But if we could assert on the box that Roomba had a vacuum, then everyone would be satisfied. We could charge the price that makes our economics work. Customers would deem that cost reasonable and wouldn\u2019t have to unlearn their vacuum bias.</p><p>But it felt wrong. If we must add a new system to the robot, we wanted it\u2014like all the other systems\u2014to earn its keep honestly, to do something useful. Through further discussion and calculation, we concluded that we could afford to devote about 10 percent of the robot\u2019s 30-watt power budget to a vacuum. Conventional manual vacuums typically gorged themselves on 1,200 watts of power, but if we could develop a system that provided useful cleaning while consuming only 3 W (0.25 percent of 1,200) then we would feel good about adding it to the robot. It just didn\u2019t seem very likely.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and red Roomba vacuum on a gray carpet next to a plaid multicolored blanket.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"35719\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-red-roomba-vacuum-on-a-gray-carpet-next-to-a-plaid-multicolored-blanket.jpg?id=61715075&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">iRobot built two identical second-generation Roomba prototypes, named Kipper and Tipper, one of which is shown here.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>I sometimes find that solving a problem is largely a matter of staring at the problem\u2019s source. Gaze long and intently enough at something and, Waldo-like, the solution may reveal itself. So I took one of the team\u2019s manual vacuums and stared at it. What exactly made it use as much power as it did? I knew the answer was partly marketing rather than reality. There was no simple, objective way to compare cleaning efficacy between vacuums. Lacking a results-based method, shoppers looked at inputs. For example, a vacuum with a 10-ampere motor sounds as though it should clean better than a vacuum with a 6-amp motor. But the bigger number might only mean that the manufacturer with the 10-amp claim was using a less-efficient motor\u2014the 6-amp (720-W) motor might clean just as well.</span></p><p>But even when you corrected for the amperage arms race, a vacuum was still a power glutton. Staring at the vacuum cleaner, I began to see why. The vacuum fixed in my gaze that day used the standard configuration: a cylindrical beater brush occupied the center of a wide air inlet. A motor, attached by a belt, spun the brush. Another motor, deeper in the machine, drove a centrifugal blower that drew air in through the inlet. To keep dirt particles kicked up by the beater brush entrained in the airstream, the air needed to move fast. The combination of a wide inlet and high velocity meant that every second the vacuum motor had to gulp a huge volume of air.</p><p>Accelerating all that air took considerable power\u2014the physics was inescapable. If we wanted a vacuum that sipped power rather than guzzled it, we had to move a much smaller volume of air per second. We could accomplish that\u2014without reducing air velocity\u2014if, instead of a wide inlet, we used a narrow one. To match the manual vacuum\u2019s air velocity using only a 3-W motor, I computed that we would need a narrow opening indeed: only a millimeter or two.</p><p>That instantly disqualified Roomba from using the standard vacuum configuration\u2014we could not put our bristle brush in the middle of the air inlet. That would require an inlet maybe 20 times too wide. We\u2019d have to find another arrangement.</p><h2>A Micro Vacuum that Doesn\u2019t Suck</h2><p>To test the narrow-inlet idea I turned to my favorite prototyping materials: cardboard and packing tape. Using these, I mocked up my idea. The inlet for my test vacuum was as long as Roomba\u2019s brush but only about 2 millimeters wide. To provide suction I repurposed the blower from a defunct heat gun. Then I applied my jury-rigged contraption to crushed Cheerios and a variety of other dirt stand-ins. My novel vacuum was surprisingly effective at picking up small debris from a hard surface. Using an anemometer to measure the speed of the air rushing through my narrow inlet showed that it was, as desired, as fast as the airstream in a standard vacuum cleaner.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/south-pole-roombas\" target=\"_self\">Roombas at the End of the World</a></p><p>The next step was to somehow shoehorn our microvacuum into Roomba. To form the narrow inlet we used two parallel vanes of rubber. Small rubber bumps protruding from one vane spanned the inlet, preventing the vanes from collapsing together when vacuum was applied. We placed the air inlet parallel to and just behind the brush. The only plausible space for the vacuum <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeller\" target=\"_blank\">impeller</a>, motor, and filter (needed to separate the dirt from the flowing air) was to take over a corner of the dust cup. Drawing on his now well-honed skills of packing big things into tiny spaces where they had no business fitting, mechanical engineer Eliot Mack managed somehow to accomplish this. But we did get help from an outside consultant to design the intricate shape the impeller needed to move air efficiently.</p><p>In general, regular vacuums perform better on carpet than on hard floors. But Roomba inverted that relationship. Our vacuum operated like a squeegee, pulling dirt from tile, linoleum, and wooden floors. But it was less effective on other surfaces. The sweeper mechanism did the heavy lifting when cleaning carpet.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Silver and gray Roomba robotic vacuum on a hardwood floor.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9e12a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/silver-and-gray-roomba-robotic-vacuum-on-a-hardwood-floor.jpg?id=61715088&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">iRobot released its first production version of the Roomba in September 2002.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>Despite the team\u2019s reluctance to add a vacuum and despite the unit\u2019s low power, the vacuum genuinely improved Roomba\u2019s cleaning ability. We could demonstrate this convincingly. First, we disabled Roomba\u2019s new vacuum by disconnecting the power and then cleaned a hard floor relying only on the carpet-sweeper mechanism. If we then walked across the floor barefoot, we would feel a certain amount of grit underfoot. If we repeated the exercise with vacuum power on, the floor was pristine. Bare feet would detect no grit whatsoever.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Seven people pose in front of shelves displaying awards and a gold iRobot Roomba; casual attire.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a8f77\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/seven-people-pose-in-front-of-shelves-displaying-awards-and-a-gold-irobot-roomba-casual-attire.jpg?id=61715091&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Roomba contributors present on the occasion of the 500,000th Roomba include Steve Hickey, Eliot Mack [front row], Paul Sandin, Chris Casey, Phil Mass, Joe Jones, and Jeff Ostaszewski [back row].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>Years later I learned that the focus group had a back story no one mentioned at the time. While the Roomba team had swallowed the carpet-sweeper concept hook, line, and sinker, Winston had not. He was uneasy with the notion that customers would be cleaning-mechanism agnostic\u2014thinking instead that they simply wouldn\u2019t believe our robot would clean their floors if it didn\u2019t have a vacuum. He found at least indirect support for that position when he scoured marketing data from our earlier collaboration with SC Johnson.</span></p><p>But Winston, well-attuned to the engineering psyche, knew he couldn\u2019t just declare, \u201cRoomba has to have a vacuum.\u201d We\u2019d have pushed back, probably saying something like, \u201cWhat your business-school-addled brain doesn\u2019t appreciate is that it\u2019s the carpet sweeper that makes the whole concept work!\u201d Winston had to show us. That was a key purpose of the focus group, to demonstrate to the Roomba team that we had made a deal-breaking omission. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em><em>Dancing With Roomba</em></em> <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Dancing-with-Roomba-Cracking-the-Robot-Riddle-and-Building-an-Icon/Jones/p/book/9781032890616\" target=\"_blank\">is now available for preorder</a>.</p>"

The team calls their model MorphDiff, and it\u2019s a diffusion model guided by the transcriptome, the pattern of genes turned up or down after a perturbation.</p><p>At a high level, the idea flips a familiar workflow. High-throughput imaging is a proven way to discover a compound\u2019s mechanism or spot bioactivity but profiling every candidate drug or CRISPR target isn\u2019t feasible. MorphDiff learns from cases where both gene expression and cell morphology are known, then uses only the L1000 gene expression profile as a <em>condition</em> to generate realistic post-perturbation images, either from scratch or by transforming a control image into its perturbed counterpart. The claim is that competitive fidelity on held-out (unseen) perturbations across large drug and genetic datasets plus gains on mechanism-of-action (MOA) retrieval can rival real images.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"><a href=\"https://mbzuai.ac.ae/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"shortcode-media-lightbox__toggle shortcode-media-controls__button material-icons\" style=\"background: gray;\" title=\"Select for lightbox\">aspect_ratio</a><img alt=\"Logo with connected black dots next to the words Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1e76f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/logo-with-connected-black-dots-next-to-the-words-mohamed-bin-zayed-university-of-artificial-intelligence.png?id=61715906&amp;width=980\" /></p><p>This research led by <a href=\"https://mbzuai.ac.ae/\" target=\"_blank\">MBZUAI</a> researchers starts from a biological observation: gene expression ultimately drives proteins and pathways that shape what a cell looks like under the microscope. The mapping isn\u2019t one-to-one, but there\u2019s enough shared signal for learning. Conditioning on the transcriptome offers a practical bonus too: there\u2019s simply far more publicly accessible L1000 data than paired morphology, making it easier to cover a wide swath of perturbation space. In other words, when a new compound arrives, you\u2019re likely to find its gene signature which MorphDiff can then leverage.</p><p>Under the hood, MorphDiff blends two pieces. First, a Morphology Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) compresses five-channel microscope images into a compact latent space and learns to reconstruct them with high perceptual fidelity. Second, a Latent Diffusion Model learns to denoise samples in that latent space, steering each denoising step with the L1000 vector via attention.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Diagram depicting cell painting analysis pipeline, including dataset curation and perturbation modeling.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f692c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-depicting-cell-painting-analysis-pipeline-including-dataset-curation-and-perturbation-modeling.webp?id=61715913&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Wang et al., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63478-z\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Communications</a> (2025), <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 4.0</a></small></p><p>Diffusion is a good fit here: it\u2019s intrinsically robust to noise, and the latent space variant is efficient enough to train while preserving image detail. The team implements both gene-to-image (G2I) generation (start from noise, condition on the transcriptome) and image-to-image (I2I) transformation (push a control image toward its perturbed state using the same transcriptomic condition). The latter requires no retraining thanks to an SDEdit-style procedure, which is handy when you want to explain changes relative to a control.</p><p><span>It\u2019s one thing to generate photogenic pictures; it\u2019s another to generate </span><em>biologically faithful</em><span> ones. The paper leans into both: on the generative side, MorphDiff is benchmarked against GAN and diffusion baselines using standard metrics like FID, Inception Score, coverage, density, and a CLIP-based CMMD. Across JUMP (genetic) and CDRP/LINCS (drug) test splits, MorphDiff\u2019s two modes typically land first and second, with significance tests run across multiple random seeds or independent control plates. The result is consistent: better fidelity and diversity, especially on OOD perturbations where practical value lives.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\">The bigger picture is that generative AI has finally reached a fidelity level where in-silico microscopy can stand in for first-pass experiments.</p><p><span></span><span>More interesting for biologists, the authors step beyond image aesthetics to morphology features. They extract hundreds of CellProfiler features (textures, intensities, granularity, cross-channel correlations) and ask whether the generated distributions match the ground truth.</span></p><p>In side-by-side comparisons, MorphDiff\u2019s feature clouds line up with real data more closely than baselines like IMPA. Statistical tests show that over 70 percent of generated feature distributions are indistinguishable from real ones, and feature-wise scatter plots show the model correctly captures <em>differences</em> from control on the most perturbed features. Crucially, the model also preserves correlation structure between gene expression and morphology features, with higher agreement to ground truth than prior methods, evidence that it\u2019s modeling more than surface style.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graphs and images comparing different computational methods in biological data analysis.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"44b8e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/graphs-and-images-comparing-different-computational-methods-in-biological-data-analysis.webp?id=61715915&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Wang et al., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63478-z\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Communications</a> (2025), <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 4.0</a></small></p><p>The drug results scale up that story to thousands of treatments.

In top-k retrieval experiments, the average improvement over the strongest baseline is 16.9 percent and 8.0 percent over transcriptome-only, with robustness shown across several k values and metrics like mean average precision and folds-of-enrichment. That\u2019s a strong signal that simulated morphology contains complementary information to chemical structure and transcriptomics which is enough to help find look-alike mechanisms even when the molecules themselves look nothing alike.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\">MorphDiff\u2019s generated morphologies not only beat prior image-generation baselines but also outperform retrieval using gene expression alone, and they approach the accuracy you get using real images.</p><p>The paper also lists some current limitations that hint at potential future improvements. Inference with diffusion remains relatively slow; the authors suggest plugging in newer samplers to speed generation. Time and concentration (two factors that biologists care about) aren\u2019t explicitly encoded due to data constraints; the architecture could take them as additional conditions when matched datasets become available. And because MorphDiff depends on perturbed gene expression as input, it can\u2019t conjure morphology for perturbations that lack transcriptome measurements; a natural extension is to chain with models that predict gene expression for unseen drugs (the paper cites GEARS as an example). Finally, generalization inevitably weakens as you stray far from the training distribution; larger, better-matched multimodal datasets will help, as will conditioning on more modalities such as structures, text descriptions, or chromatin accessibility.</p><p>What does this mean in practice? Imagine a screening team with a large L1000 library but a smaller imaging budget. MorphDiff becomes a phenotypic copilot: generate predicted morphologies for new compounds, cluster them by similarity to known mechanisms, and prioritize which to image for confirmation. Because the model also surfaces interpretable feature shifts, researchers can peek under the hood. Did ER texture and mitochondrial intensity move the way we\u2019d expect for an EGFR inhibitor? Did two structurally unrelated molecules land in the same phenotypic neighborhood? Those are the kinds of hypotheses that accelerate mechanism hunting and repurposing.</p><p>The bigger picture is that generative AI has finally reached a fidelity level where in-silico microscopy can stand in for first-pass experiments. We\u2019ve already seen text-to-image models explode in consumer domains; here, a transcriptome-to-morphology model shows that the same diffusion machinery can do scientifically useful work such as capturing subtle, multi-channel phenotypes and preserving the relationships that make those images more than eye candy. It won\u2019t replace the microscope. But if it reduces the number of plates you have to run to find what matters, that\u2019s time and money you can spend validating the hits that count.</p>"

The research giant marked its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/bell-labs-100-birthday\" target=\"_self\">100th anniversary</a> in May at its venerable campus in Murray Hill\u2014part of New Providence, N.J.\u2014where major technological developments have occurred, such as the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/bellmac-32-ieee-milestone\" target=\"_self\">Bellmac-32 microprocessor</a> and the<em> </em>satellite Earth station known as the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/big-bang-theory-discovery\" target=\"_self\">Horn Antenna</a>, which helped prove the big bang theory.</p><p>The company also held a groundbreaking ceremony on 4 September for its new headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., about 32 kilometers south of Murray Hill and 10 km from <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a>\u2019s Piscataway office.</p><p>Construction of the 10-story, 34,374-square-meter building is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2027. The <a href=\"https://www.helixnj.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Health and Life Science Exchange 2</a> building, known as HELIX 2, is the second of three planned edifices being constructed in the city\u2019s new innovation district, which is designed to attract research labs, workspaces, and office suites for startups.</p><p> Attendees at the ceremony included <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nokia-4g-cellular-network-moon\" target=\"_self\">Thierry E. Klein</a>, the Bell Labs solutions research president, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-vetter-a72b444/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Vetter</a>, the Bell Labs core research president. Both men are IEEE Fellows. New Jersey\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/governor/admin/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Phil Murphy</a>, was there too, as were New Brunswick Mayor <a href=\"https://www.cityofnewbrunswick.org/government/mayors_office/index.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">James Cahill</a> and other state and local officials.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s groundbreaking marks a new and exciting chapter in Bell Labs\u2019 long history in New Jersey,\u201d Klein said. \u201cAs we build and move into the HELIX, this continues our legacy of excellence, pioneering spirit, and commitment to breakthrough research on the East Coast. The location offers unique advantages that will accelerate our innovation capabilities and provide greater proximity to academic centers of excellence and fantastic new startups and ventures.\u201d</p><p>The new location, he said, \u201cwill give access to a vibrant and urban environment that will help us attract the next generation of talent. Access to universities such as <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Princeton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rutgers.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rutgers</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.njit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.stevens.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stevens Institute of Technology</a> is incomparable. This is not just a move for the next two, three, four, or five years; this is going to be home for Bell Labs for a very, very long time.\u201d</p><h2>A hub of innovation</h2><p>Nokia Bell Labs could have relocated its headquarters anywhere in the world, Murphy noted, but it chose to remain in New Jersey.</p><p>\u201cOur illustrious history of innovation in New Jersey could be summarized in two words: Bell Labs,\u201d the governor said. \u201cFor over a century, Bell Labs has transformed our state, our nation, and the world. This is literally an iconic and globally unique institution. We break ground and start to establish a new foundation for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-quantum-computing-hausi-muller\" target=\"_self\">quantum physics</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\">generative artificial intelligence</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/telecommunications/\" target=\"_self\">optical communications</a>. Through partnerships, joint ventures, and spinoffs, Nokia Bell Labs will facilitate new products and companies that will [continue to] drive the innovation economy in New Jersey.\u201d</p><p>To ensure New Jersey would be at the forefront of innovation, the governor in 2018 announced his intent to establish 12 <a href=\"https://www.njinnovates.com/about-njih\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">innovation hubs</a> throughout the state as a way to attract entrepreneurs, startups, and early-stage companies. The first hub\u2014the HELIX 1 building, adjacent to Nokia Bell Labs\u2019 new headquarters\u2014is expected to open next year and include Rutgers\u2019s medical school and translational research institute.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"New Jersey governor Phil Murphy speaking to a small audience from a stage podium near a construction site.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"33081\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/new-jersey-governor-phil-murphy-speaking-to-a-small-audience-from-a-stage-podium-near-a-construction-site.jpg?id=61745766&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, at the podium addresses attendees at the groundbreaking ceremony. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nokia</small></p><p>The facilities will offer furnished offices and labs outfitted with scientific equipment, officials say. Tenants will include <a href=\"https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Hackensack Meridian Health</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rwjbh.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health</a>.</p><p>New Brunswick is no stranger to innovators, Cahill noted. The <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Johnson & Johnson</a> pharmaceutical company is headquartered in the city and got its start in a local wallpaper factory. The Johnson brothers and <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Thomas_Alva_Edison\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Edison</a> often ate at a nearby drugstore lunch counter, where they discussed advancements in manufacturing, the mayor said. <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Thomas_Edison_at_Menlo_Park\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edison\u2019s laboratory was in Menlo Park</a>. Cahill also said that <a href=\"https://princetonhistory.org/research/historic-princeton/albert-einstein/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Albert Einstein</a>, who worked at Princeton University and lived in the town, was often spotted strolling the streets of New Brunswick, about 30 km away.</p><h2>State-of-the-art research facilities</h2><p>The new Nokia Bell Lab offices will cater to the needs of research scientists and specialists in focused areas, Klein said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an efficient, modern, and low-carbon facility providing sustainable power, heating, and cooling capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cOur researchers will have access to the best facility possible. That is our dream.\u201d</p><p>This is not the first time Bell Labs has moved its headquarters, Vetter noted. The primary R&amp;D activities were set up in New York City in 1925. They moved to Murray Hill in 1941. Some of the biggest innovations were developed there during the following decade, including the transistor and the cellular network.</p><p>\u201cI want to think that our move will again be a catalyst for breakthrough innovations to happen in the decade after we move in and will be in a variety of areas such as 7G, AI, quantum computing, and quantum network security,\u201d Vetter said.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cAs we build and move into the HELIX, this continues our legacy of excellence, pioneering spirit, and commitment to breakthrough research on the East Coast.\u201d <strong>\u2014Thierry Klein</strong></p><p>\u201cWe also need to make sure the research goes into the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like to say that if somebody has a problem in the real world and you solve it in the lab but you don\u2019t make that leap of technology into the real world, the problem still exists.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just research or breakthrough technologies,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s also creating the companies that will commercialize these technologies and lead the next century of innovation.\u201d</p><h2>IEEE Milestones recognize Bell Labs innovations</h2><p>Another celebratory event is scheduled for 21 October in Murray Hill. Several technologies developed there are to be designated as IEEE Milestones.
