        "summary": "This paper examines the motives, constraints, and sequencing behind Argentina\u2019s 2017 tax reform, drawing on the authors\u2019 direct involvement in its design and implementation. We document how a large inherited fiscal imbalance, a disinflation program that mechanically raised real pension spending under the pre-existing indexation rule, minority status in Congress, and limited administrative capacity jointly narrowed the feasible policy set. Within those constraints, the reform aimed to be near-revenue-neutral while rebalancing the system toward investment and employment: phasing down corporate rates with dividend taxation and inflation adjustment, reducing the labor wedge at the bottom via a per-worker deduction, rationalizing VAT and excises (including carbon and health-motivated taxes), and coordinating with provinces to cap and de-cascade the turnover tax (ISIB) through a Fiscal Consensus. We trace how coalition politics and sectoral vetoes reshaped the package, why forward guidance and escape clauses were embedded ex ante, and how the 2018 sudden stop, followed by policy reversals, limited the reform\u2019s realized growth dividend. We draw four lessons: credibility is a fiscal instrument; provincial coordination beats technocratic perfection; discretionary levers invite rent-seeking; and targeting informality and compliance margins yields higher returns than blunt rate changes. The analysis offers a pragmatic template for tax reform under macroeconomic fragility, federal fragmentation, and state-capacity constraints."

Between 1990 and 2019, migrants from five Asian countries\u2014India, China, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines\u2014accounted for over one-third of the growth in US software developers and a quarter of the increase in scientists, engineers, and physicians. Drawing on census microdata, visa records, and administrative sources, I show how US demand for talent in information technology, higher education, and healthcare interacted with Asia\u2019s demographic and educational transformations to generate this migration boom. Policy reforms (notably the H-1B, F-1, and J-1 visa programs) and sectoral shifts\u2014such as the internet revolution, declining public support for universities, and aging-related healthcare demand\u2014created persistent needs for foreign students and workers. Asian economies were uniquely positioned to meet this demand through rapid tertiary expansion, strong STEM institutions, English proficiency, and diaspora networks. These inflows boosted US innovation, entrepreneurship, and service-sector productivity while fostering \u201cbrain gain\u201d and \u201cbrain circulation\u201d in Asia. Together, these trends reveal how talent flows from Asia have become central to the structure and growth of the modern US economy."

Using almost a decade of data since the referendum, we combine simulations based on macro data with estimates derived from micro data collected through our Decision Maker Panel survey. These estimates suggest that by 2025, Brexit had reduced UK GDP by 6% to 8%, with the impact accumulating gradually over time. We estimate that investment was reduced by between 12% and 18%, employment by 3% to 4% and productivity by 3% to 4%. These large negative impacts reflect a combination of elevated uncertainty, reduced demand, diverted management time, and increased misallocation of resources from a protracted Brexit process. Comparing these with contemporary forecasts \u2013 providing a rare macro example to complement the burgeoning micro-literature of social science predictions \u2013 shows that these forecasts were accurate over a 5-year horizon, but they underestimated the impact over a decade."

        "summary": "We study how market power in artificial intelligence (AI) shapes wages and welfare in open-economy general equilibrium by treating AI as a priced, imported factor. Across three models, we separate technical efficiency from the impact of upstream price setting. In a two-traded-goods benchmark, the incidence of AI price changes depends on how sectoral skill intensity changes with AI prices; non-monotone intensity can generate \u201cdouble harm\u201d for unskilled workers (lower real wage after a large decrease in the price of AI, and real wage decreases further when the AI price rises as a result of market power). With one non-traded sector, we observe that the classic \u201cDutch disease\u201d effect here would arise when one sector gets more productive and draws labor away from other sectors, creating scarcity and raising prices; but this is not what we expect from the introduction of labor-substituting AI. In contrast, our last model considers two non-traded sectors and CES/free entry, and the opportunity for discrete adoption of technology that replaces unskilled labor from the AI-using sector. When AI reduces unit costs and increases variety, it will not pull U from non-tradables, instead it will displace workers from the AI-using sector and lower wage due to diminishing returns in alternative sectors. Strategic upstream pricing of AI then harms welfare through unit-cost (usage fees) and variety (access fees) channels, with income leakage abroad. We derive an adoption frontier tying feasible usage prices to displaced workers\u2019 outside options and show a monopolist typically prices on this boundary; capping one instrument shifts rents to the other. Broad gains for the adopting country relies on pressure (or regulation) on both usage and access fees and as well as policy that supports productive absorption of displaced labor. The framework clarifies when AI can lower real wages and aggregate welfare despite efficiency gains."

Using labor force surveys covering the informal sector, we show the minimum wage exhibits near full passthrough to informal employees working in formal firms, about half of all informal employees. The formal-to-informal reallocation elasticity with respect to the formal-wage is small: -0.28. Our findings illustrate how minimum wages can positively affect living standards for workers thought beyond the reach of labor law, a sizable share of the workforce in developing economies."

Using newly digitized bank and branch balance sheet data matched to state and county panels, we provide direct evidence that branching produced lasting productivity gains without aggregate capital deepening by leveraging internal capital markets to improve the geographic allocation of capital. Our novel ``deposit market access'' measure shows that bank funding grew most in capital-constrained counties within branching states. Both market access and border discontinuity designs indicate that branching\u2019s organizational structure reduced capital allocation frictions to generate persistent growth."

        "summary": "We study the causal effect of different early career occupational experiences on labor market outcomes. To do so, we pair over two decades of administrative tax data with internal personnel records from one of the largest employers of young adults in the United States: the US Army. Enlistees work in a diverse and varied set of occupations, including non-combat roles like mechanics, legal services, financial specialists, cooks, dental hygienists, police officers, and network/computer specialists. Occupational eligibility is determined by test score cutoffs which we leverage in a series of 35 regression discontinuity designs. We find that a typical early career occupational experience generates a substantial amount of path dependence, with point estimates that suggest a 19p.p. increase in the likelihood of being observed in an identical or closely related occupation as much as 20 years later. The corresponding impact of different occupations on earnings are highly heterogeneous, yet predictable: long-run changes in the average earnings of the occupations applicants are pushed into, and pulled out-of, can explain over 60% of the causal variation across cutoffs, with point estimates that suggest improvements in occupational earnings premia translate dollar-for-dollar into economic success. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of early career occupational experience as a key channel for promoting long-run well-being among young adults who are not college bound."

AI is making warfare more precise and deadly amidst intransigent conflicts. AI companies are exploiting people in the global South who work as data labelers, and profiting from content creators worldwide by using their work without license or compensation. The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" target=\"_blank\">enormous energy demands</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, particularly in the United States, public investment in science seems to be <a href=\"https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/leading-research-universities-report/white-house-proposes-steep-cuts-science-and-education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>redirected</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/trump-plan-highlights-ai-for-science\" target=\"_blank\">concentrated</a> on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And Big Tech companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.</p><p>This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here\u2019s how.</p><h2>The Academy\u2019s View of AI <a target=\"_blank\"></a></h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Pew study</span></a> in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn\u2019t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 <a href=\"https://sci-ops.org/survey/artificial-intelligence-survey-x/scientists-perceptions-and-personal-use/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of generative AI in daily life\u2014by nearly a three to one ratio.</p><p>We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, cybersecurity, physical sciences, drug discovery, public health, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we\u2019ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we\u2019ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.</p><p>We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.</p><h2>Elements of a Positive Vision for AI</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/working-waterfront/hope-a-framework-for-climate-action/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7178677/climate-scientist-optimist-refuse-to-give-up-hope/\" target=\"_blank\">have</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">rgu</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">ed</a> <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that</a> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">turn</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ing</a> the <a href=\"https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/making-case-climate-optimism\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tide</a> of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.</p><p>There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples\u2019 lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.</p><p>Some examples: AI is eliminating communication barriers across languages, including under-resourced contexts like <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5230744\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>marginalized sign languages</span></a> and <a href=\"https://ojs.bilpub.com/index.php/card/article/view/517\" target=\"_blank\">indigenous African languages</a>.

National labs are building AI <a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/cels/auroragpt-foundation-models-for-science\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">foundation models</a> to accelerate scientific research. And throughout the fields of medicine and biology, machine learning is solving scientific problems like the prediction of protein structure in aid of drug discovery, which was recognized with a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Prize</a> in 2024.</p><p>While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.</p><h2><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>A Call to Action for Scientists</h2><p>In our new book, <span><em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\">Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship</a></em></span><span>, we describe four key actions for policymakers committed to steering AI toward the public good.</span></p><p>These apply to scientists as well.

We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Melvin Kranzberg observed</span></a>, \u201cis neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today. But we cannot create a positive future without a vision of what it looks like.</p>"

Menifee, by contrast, is producing operational data in real households.</p><h2>Why CCS Matters</h2><p>When electric vehicles first hit the market, CCS was designed for one job: move power quickly from the grid to the car. The main goal was reliable, standardized, fast charging. That fact helps explain the difference between CCS public chargers, (many of which are rated for 350-kilowatts or more) and their CHAdeMO-based counterparts, which typically max out at 100 kW (but are capable of providing home backup or grid services).</p><p>Bidirectional operation wasn\u2019t included in the original CCS standard for several reasons. Early automakers and utilities worried about safety risks, grid interference, and added hardware cost. So CCS\u2019s original communication protocol linking EVs and charging stations\u2014<a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/55365.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 15118</a>\u2014didn\u2019t even include an electronic handshake for power export. The 2022 update, <a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/iso/iso15118202022?ad_acct=0000&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=1042027569&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_gXFXvQl5EQDGOCEFGoh01iGDy7&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvJHIBhCgARIsAEQnWlD3zc6ZUuyEO-qdCkAL2-Kv1Mvg3Cz3_Ew5PD8jfmM0o-JDSdJ3YHsaAvwfEALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 15118-20</a>, added secure two-way communication, enabling CCS vehicles to supply energy to buildings and the grid.</p><p>Wallbox\u2019s Quasar 2 residential charger implements the update through an active-bridge converter circuit built with silicon-carbide transistors, achieving efficient bidirectional flow. Its <a href=\"https://support.wallbox.com/wp-content/uploads/ht_kb/2025/04/Datasheet_QX2NA_EN_0225.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12-kW</a> power rating can support typical critical loads in a house, such as heating and cooling, refrigeration, and networking, says <a href=\"https://es.linkedin.com/in/aleix-maix%C3%A9-sas-28a6724b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aleix Maix\u00e9 Sas</a>, a system electronics architect at Wallbox.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An electric SUV plugged into a charger that is mounted on the exterior of a residential garage.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fb01e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-electric-suv-plugged-into-a-charger-that-is-mounted-on-the-exterior-of-a-residential-garage.jpg?id=62054284&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">As the company\u2019s name humbly suggests, Wallbox\u2019s chargers look like plain old boxes\u2014although they contain high-tech components.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Wallbox</small></p><h2>The Menifee blueprint</h2><p>Each of the Menifee homes outfitted with a V2H system combines a rooftop solar array with a 13-kWh <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/solar/sunpower-sunvault-review/\" target=\"_blank\">SunVault</a> stationary battery from <a href=\"https://us.sunpower.com/home-solar/solar-battery-storage\" target=\"_blank\">SunPower</a>. During normal operation, solar energy powers daily household loads and charges the stationary battery. On abundantly sunny days, the solar panels can also top up the Kia EV9\u2019s battery. When the grid fails\u2014or when energy prices spike\u2014the home isolates itself: Solar power and energy stored in the SunVault keep essential systems and appliances going, while the EV battery extends power if the outage persists.</p><p>This past summer, the UC Irvine researchers tracked how solar output, stationary storage, and vehicle power interacted under summer demand and wildfire-related grid stress. They found that \u201cthe vehicle adds a major resilience feature,\u201d according to Samuelsen, who is the <span>Menifee project manager. \u201cIt can relieve grid strain, increase renewable utilization, and lower costs by supplying power during peak-rate hours.\u201d</span></p><h2>Engineering the Two-Way Home</h2><p>Home builders and the makers of electric vehicle service equipment such as Wallbox are not the only entities reconsidering how to meet the engineering demands V2H introduces. Utilities, too, must make changes to accommodate bidirectional power flow. Interconnection procedures and energy pricing structures are among the factors that must be redesigned or reconsidered.</p><h2>A Glimpse of the Energy Future</h2><p>Analysts expect <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/bidirectional-charging.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">double-digit annual growth in bidirectional-charging system sales</a> through the late 2020s as costs fall and standards mature. In regions facing wildfire- or storm-related outages and steep time-of-use pricing curves, projects like Menifee\u2019s are showing a clear path towards the use of cars as huge and flexible energy reserves.</p><p>When EV batteries can supply energy for homes as easily as they do for propulsion, the boundary between transportation and energy will begin to disappear\u2014and with it, old concepts regarding who\u2019s an energy supplier and who\u2019s a customer.</p>"

These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of<a href=\"https://www.projectpsyche.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Project Psyche</a>, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. <a href=\"https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9760/\" target=\"_blank\">Psyche</a> is part of a larger effort, the<a href=\"https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Darwin Tree of Life project</a>, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the<a href=\"https://www.earthbiogenome.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Earth BioGenome Project</a>. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of <em><em>all</em></em> of Earth\u2019s roughly 1.8 million organisms\u2014every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that\u2019s made up of cells that have a nucleus.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\"><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a></p><p>None of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it\u2019s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal\u2014to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035\u2014won\u2019t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>But the project\u2019s success may ultimately hinge on functions <em><em>other</em></em> than sequencing. For example, after a creature\u2019s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data\u2014consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs\u2014must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, <em><em>before</em></em> an organism\u2019s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it\u2019s an animal, capture it. As I discovered with the Psyche team in the woods, valleys, and jagged peaks of South Tyrol, wrangling insects presents challenges that can defy logistics, technology, and even reason.</p><h2>How Can You Explain the Surpassingly Strange Atlas Blue Butterfly? </h2><p>When I first heard about Project Psyche, the first thing I wondered was, Why Lepidoptera? I put the question to<a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/wright-charlotte/\" target=\"_blank\"> Charlotte Wright</a> and<a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/meier-joana/\" target=\"_blank\"> Joana Meier</a> at the hotel in Malles Venosta, Italy, that served as the headquarters for the Project Psyche expedition. They lead the project from its base at the<a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> in Cambridgeshire, England.

By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, \u201cwe can find out how they have evolved and how they\u2019ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.\u201d</p><p>Those genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell\u2019s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature\u2019s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01098-X\" target=\"_blank\"> Atlas blue butterfly</a>, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.</p><p>The Atlas blue is \u201ca very good example of something that\u2019s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,\u201d says Meier. \u201cWhat we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications\u201d\u2014thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. \u201cThen we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, \u2018What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that\u2019s broken?\u2019 \u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Some three dozen species of Lepidoptera are seen pinned to a display board, with tiny hand-written notes associated with each one.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a9f32\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/some-three-dozen-species-of-lepidoptera-are-seen-pinned-to-a-display-board-with-tiny-hand-written-notes-associated-with-each-on.jpg?id=61998921&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>And it\u2019s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data.

He\u2019s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he\u2019s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it\u2019s black). He\u2019s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth\u2019s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.</p><p>The objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different \u201cmicroenvironments,\u201d he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there\u2019s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young man in a bright blue T-shirt and black cargo pants standing on a slope amid brilliant purple wildflowers swings a bright yellow butterfly net.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"70ee6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-man-in-a-bright-blue-t-shirt-and-black-cargo-pants-standing-on-a-slope-amid-brilliant-purple-wildflowers-swings-a-brigh.jpg?id=61998951&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Genetics researcher No\u00e9 Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Luigi Avantaggiato        </small></p><p>\u201cOver there\u201d\u2014he points across the valley to the opposite slope. \u201cIt faces north.

As the sky darkens to a deep blue, we trudge back to the hut to stoke the fire and wait.</p><p>At the crack of dawn the next day, Moro is jubilant as he returns with the night\u2019s haul. There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they\u2019ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

It\u2019s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can\u2019t even fly at night or in the rain. \u201cButterflies are just day-flying moths,\u201d Wahlberg quips. \u201cPeople think of them as different and special, but they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>In this new era of mass genome sequencing, they\u2019re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera\u2014about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 <a href=\"https://www.ourbreathingplanet.com/6-fabulous-european-lepidoptera/\" target=\"_blank\">European Lepidoptera</a> species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg\u2019s reckoning. And they\u2019ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.</p><p>So the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the<a href=\"https://www.lesfruitsdemer.com/wild-statia-what-are-micromoths/\" target=\"_blank\"> micromoths</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/size-really-doesnt-matter-when-it-comes-to-micro-and-macro-moths.html\" target=\"_blank\">Micromoths</a> have long vexed entomologists.

As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as \u201cmacromoths\u201d). There are a <em><em>lot</em></em> of micromoths\u2014at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young woman stands at night next to a plastic vessel, about a meter tall, which is lit from within by a purple glow.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d5d8d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-woman-stands-at-night-next-to-a-plastic-vessel-about-a-meter-tall-which-is-lit-from-within-by-a-purple-glow.jpg?id=61999056&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>That\u2019s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes.

It\u2019s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there\u2019s a mitochondrial gene, called<a href=\"https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1937-the-ideal-barcoding-gene\" target=\"_blank\"> CO1</a>, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. \u201cWe have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,\u201d Wahlberg says. \u201cAnd only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/dna-barcoding-species-detection-and-high-throughput-assays-71860\" target=\"_blank\">DNA barcoding</a> was invented in the early 2000s by<a href=\"https://scienceline.org/2008/02/tweed-bio-dnabarcoding/\" target=\"_blank\"> Paul Hebert</a> and colleagues at the<a href=\"https://www.uoguelph.ca/\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Guelph</a>, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it.

The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-9-214\" target=\"_blank\"> 100 to 250 base pairs</a>.

Working together, Spanish and Andorran researchers affiliated with the<a href=\"https://www.biogenoma.cat/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\"> Catalan Initiative for the Earth BioGenome Project </a>sequenced the genome of the violet copper butterfly<em><em>, Lycaena helle</em></em>, a creature that was<a href=\"https://shilap.org/revista/article/view/185\" target=\"_blank\"> first studied in 1775</a><em><em>.</em></em> They described their efforts in<a href=\"https://f1000research.com/articles/14-60/v1\" target=\"_blank\"> a paper</a> published by <a href=\"https://f1000research.com/\" target=\"_blank\">F1000Research</a>.</p><p>This was no routine procedure. Typically when researchers map a genome, an organism is sampled and the DNA is sequenced. After sequencing, the mass of fragmented genetic data must be assembled into a complete genome sequence and then that complete sequence must be manually verified, in a process called curation, and then annotated. In annotation, the genome\u2019s many genes are identified and, ideally, their functions described.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A bespectacled man in a dark blue T-shirt stands next to a storage cabinet with his arms folded across his chest.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"085c4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-bespectacled-man-in-a-dark-blue-t-shirt-stands-next-to-a-storage-cabinet-with-his-arms-folded-across-his-chest.jpg?id=61999096&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Gen\u00f3mico in Barcelona, has high hopes for an emerging technique to identify the genes within a large mass of genetic data.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>Today, curation and annotation are time-consuming processes, regarded as major bottlenecks to the rapid progress that the Earth BioGenome Project desperately needs to reach its 2035 goal. Finding the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411012682#:~:text=Summary,basis%20of%20long%2Ddistance%20migration\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of genes</a> within the huge mass of sequenced data is a mostly automated process now but it can involve some serious bioinformatic sleuthing. \u201cYou take your linear genome, your sequence, and you go and you say, \u2018Ah, look here. There\u2019s a gene that starts here,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.cnag.eu/ivo-g-gut\" target=\"_blank\"> Ivo Gut</a>, director of the<a href=\"https://www.cnag.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Centro Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Gen\u00f3mico</a> (CNAG), in Barcelona. \u201c \u2018And this is the structure of the gene.\u2019 And then you can sort of figure out what that is. You look whether that gene is known, for example, in another species. And then you go to the next one, and so on. And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,\u201d of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.</p><p>Gut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\"> ribonucleic acid</a>. When a gene specifies, or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hudsonalpha.org/edna-gene-expression/\" target=\"_blank\">expresses</a>,\u201d a protein, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\">RNA</a> acts as the \u201cmessenger,\u201d carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.</p><p>The breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a>, in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>.\u201d] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations\u2014CNAG, the<a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Centre for Genomic Regulation</a> (CRG), the<a href=\"https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Institute of Evolutionary Biology</a> at Pompeu Fabra University, and the<a href=\"https://web.ub.edu/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Barcelona</a>\u2014and from<a href=\"https://ari.ad/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Andorra Research and Innovation</a>, in Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria.</p><p>The genome of the female <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaena_helle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">violet copper butterfly</a>, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs.

In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4687140/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">very difficult to predict by computational means</a>. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says <a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/roderic_guigo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Roderic Guig\u00f3 Serra</a>, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.</p><p>\u201cLong-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,\u201d he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, \u201cwe get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,\u201d Serra declares.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A woman wearing a white lab coat and lavender gloves holds a pipette above a black colored box roughly the size of desktop printer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"27c81\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-wearing-a-white-lab-coat-and-lavender-gloves-holds-a-pipette-above-a-black-colored-box-roughly-the-size-of-desktop-print.jpg?id=61999110&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the Guig\u00f2 Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>His group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species\u2014including humans. They\u2019re doing this through <a href=\"https://www.gencodegenes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gencode</a>, an international consortium that aims to produce improved, \u201creference\u201d annotations for the human and mouse genomes. Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it\u2014particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39554180/\" target=\"_blank\">18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes</a>. \u201cThese genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,\u201d says Serra.</p><p>Researchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world\u2019s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe\u2019s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.</p><p>It\u2019s a mammoth task. As they grapple with it, its practitioners can take inspiration from the novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov. \u201cMy loathings are simple,\u201d<a href=\"https://dianedooley.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/the-strong-opinions-of-vladimir-nabokov/\" target=\"_blank\"> he wrote in 1973</a>. \u201cStupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music. My pleasures are the most intense known to man: writing and butterfly hunting.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. \u201cIt sometimes could be a lonely experience,\u201d says Berry. \u201cRepresentation does matter.\u201d</p><p>Now, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at <a href=\"https://www.rose-hulman.edu/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three people of color, including Professor Carlotta Berry in the center,  talk about a tabletop modular robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c4601\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-people-of-color-including-professor-carlotta-berry-in-the-center-talk-about-a-tabletop-modular-robot.jpg?id=62000379&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</small></p><p><span>She also works to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/supporting-black-scholars-in-robotics\" target=\"_blank\">support people of color in engineering</a>. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. \u201cThis was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,\u201d says Berry, noting that today only about </span><a href=\"https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/only-8-electronics-engineering-workforce-are-women\" target=\"_blank\">8 percent</a><span> of electronics engineers are women and about </span><a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/electrical-engineer-jobs/demographics/\" target=\"_blank\">5 percent</a><span> are Black. \u201cIt was time for something to change.\u201d</span></p><h2>Berry\u2019s Path to Teaching</h2><p>As a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school\u2014especially math\u2014and thought she\u2019d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what an engineer was,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone who was an engineer.\u201d After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.gatech.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> as part of a dual degree program with <a href=\"https://www.spelman.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Spelman College</a>, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s in mathematics in 1992.</p><p>After her bachelor\u2019s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master\u2019s in electrical engineering and control systems at <a href=\"https://wayne.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wayne State University</a> in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. \u201cI really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,\u201d she says. </p><p>After a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Vanderbilt University</a> in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school\u2014and at last found herself on the right career path: \u201cI always wanted to be an educator,\u201d she says. </p><h2>A Turn Toward Outreach</h2><p>Berry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three women of color sit in front of signs about Girls in STEM. A multitude of small wheeled robots are on the floor in front of them.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"58516\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-women-of-color-sit-in-front-of-signs-about-girls-in-stem-a-multitude-of-small-wheeled-robots-are-on-the-floor-in-front-of.jpg?id=62000351&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman\u2019s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Griffin Museum of Science and Industry</small></p><p>\u201cAs a full professor, I don\u2019t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I provide education for students and for the community, that\u2019s also part of my research and service.\u201d <span>For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.</span></p><p>Since 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, \u201cto the streets.\u201d</p><p>Berry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/sphero-indi-brings-robotics-to-prekindergarten\" target=\"_blank\">kids just a few years old</a> to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, \u201cvisibility matters.\u201d</p><p>With any audience, Berry is always \u201cvery approachable and very engaging,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicki-manion/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicki Manion</a>, a program manager for Rose-Hulman\u2019s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.</p><p>\u201cI have to go where people are,\u201d Berry says. \u201cI get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.\u201d</p><p>This past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics\u2014sense, plan, act\u2014the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.</p><p>Last year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.</p><h2>Online Community and Writing</h2><p><span>Berry hasn\u2019t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded <a href=\"https://blackinengineering.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Engineering</a> and <a href=\"https://blackinrobotics.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Robotics</a>\u2014part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it\u2019s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. \u201cThere were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,\u201d she says.</span></p><p>Her professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: \u201cThat was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.\u201d In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the <a href=\"https://swe.org/magazine/dee-award-berry-22/\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Women Engineers</a> and <a href=\"https://ghc.anitab.org/awards-programs/abie-awards\" target=\"_blank\">AnitaB.org</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"The book cover for There's a Robot in My Closet, by Dr. Carlotta A.

During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children\u2019s book she knew she had to write: <em><em>There\u2019s a Robot in My Closet</em></em>. <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/theres-a-robot-in-my-closet-carlotta-a-berry/1145214444\" target=\"_blank\">The book</a> spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (<span>Berry also writes STEM-centered </span><span>romance novels</span><span> for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of h</span><span>er book </span><em><em>Elevated Inferno</em></em><span>, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life\u2014an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) </span></p><p>While balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds \u201csee themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.\u201d</p>"

Every leap\u2014whether it\u2019s smarter phones, more capable cars, or breakthroughs in healthcare and science\u2014relies on chips that are more complex, faster, and packed with more features than ever before. But creating these chips is not just a question of sheer engineering talent or ambition. The design process itself has reached staggering levels of complexity, and with it, the challenge to keep productivity and quality moving forward.</p><p>As we push against the boundaries of physics, chipmakers face more than just technical hurdles. The workforce challenges, tight timelines, and the requirements for building reliable chips are stricter than ever. Enormous effort goes into making sure chip layouts follow detailed constraints\u2014such as maintaining minimum feature sizes for transistors and wires, keeping proper spacing between different layers like metal, polysilicon, and active areas, and ensuring vias overlap correctly to create solid electrical connections. These design rules multiply with every new technology generation. For every innovation, there\u2019s pressure to deliver more with less. So, the question becomes: How do we help designers meet these demands, and how can technology help us handle the complexity without compromising on quality?</p><h2>Shifting the paradigm: the rise of AI in electronic design automation</h2><p>A major wave of change is moving through the entire field of electronic design automation (EDA), the specialized area of software and tools that chipmakers use to design, analyze, and verify the complex integrated circuits inside today\u2019s chips. Artificial intelligence is already touching many parts of the chip design flow\u2014helping with placement and routing, predicting yield outcomes, tuning analog circuits, automating simulation, and even guiding early architecture planning. Rather than simply speeding up old steps, AI is opening doors to new ways of thinking and working.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>Instead of brute-force computation or countless lines of custom code, AI uses advanced algorithms to spot patterns, organize massive datasets, and highlight issues that might otherwise take weeks of manual work to uncover. For example, generative AI can help designers ask questions and get answers in natural language, streamlining routine tasks. Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>This growing partnership between human expertise and machine intelligence is paving the way for what some call a \u201cshift left\u201d or concurrent build revolution\u2014finding and fixing problems much earlier in the design process, before they grow into expensive setbacks. For chipmakers, this means higher quality and faster time to market. For designers, it means a chance to focus on innovation rather than chasing bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Flow diagram: IC design rule checking (DRC), SoC integration, physical verification showing errors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c40c3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/flow-diagram-ic-design-rule-checking-drc-soc-integration-physical-verification-showing-errors.jpg?id=61784279&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 1.

Physical verification checks whether a chip layout meets the manufacturer\u2019s strict rules and faithfully matches the original functional schematic. Its main goal is to ensure the design can be reliably manufactured into a working chip, free of physical defects that might cause failures later on.</span></p><p>Design rule checking (DRC) is the backbone of physical verification. DRC software scans every corner of a chip\u2019s layout for violations\u2014features that might cause defects, reduce yield, or simply make the design un-manufacturable. But today\u2019s chips aren\u2019t just bigger; they\u2019re more intricate, woven from many layers of logic, memory, and analog components, sometimes stacked in three dimensions. The rules aren\u2019t simple either. They may depend on the geometry, the context, the manufacturing process and even the interactions between distant layout features.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man with wavy black hair in a black blazer and white shirt against a plain background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12f34\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-with-wavy-black-hair-in-a-black-blazer-and-white-shirt-against-a-plain-background.jpg?id=61784318&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Priyank Jain leads product management for Calibre Interfaces at Siemens EDA.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p>Traditionally, DRC is performed late in the flow, when all components are assembled into the final chip layout. At this stage, it\u2019s common to uncover millions of violations\u2014and fixing these late-stage issues requires extensive effort, leading to costly delays.</p><p>To minimize this burden, there\u2019s a growing focus on shifting DRC earlier in the flow\u2014a strategy called \u201cshift-left.\u201d Instead of waiting until the entire design is complete, engineers try to identify and address DRC errors much sooner at block and cell levels. This concurrent design and verification approach allows the bulk of errors to be caught when fixes are faster and less disruptive.</p><p>However, running DRC earlier in the flow on a full chip when the blocks are not DRC clean produces results datasets of breathtaking scale\u2014often tens of millions to billions of \u201cerrors,\u201d warnings, or flags because the unfinished chip design is \u201cdirty\u201d compared to a chip that\u2019s been through the full design process. Navigating these \u201cdirty\u201d results is a challenge all on its own. Designers must prioritize which issues to tackle, identify patterns that point to systematic problems, and decide what truly matters. In many cases, this work is slow and \u201cmanual,\u201d depending on the ability of engineers to sort through data, filter what matters, and share findings across teams.</p><p>To cope, design teams have crafted ways to limit the flood of information. They might cap the number of errors per rule, or use informal shortcuts\u2014passing databases or screenshots by email to team members, sharing filters in chat messages, and relying on experts to know where to look. Yet this approach is not sustainable. It risks missing major, chip-wide issues that can cascade through the final product. It slows down response and makes collaboration labor-intensive.</p><p>With ongoing workforce challenges and the surging complexity of modern chips, the need for smarter, more automated DRC analysis becomes urgent. So what could a better solution look like\u2014and how can AI help bridge the gap?</p><h2>The rise of AI-powered DRC analysis</h2><p>Recent breakthroughs in AI have changed the game for DRC analysis in ways that were unthinkable even a few years ago. Rather than scanning line by line or check by check, AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster. These tools use techniques from computer vision, advanced machine learning, and big data analytics to turn what once seemed like an impossible pile of information into a roadmap for action.</p><p>AI\u2019s ability to organize chaotic datasets\u2014finding systematic problems hidden across multiple rules or regions\u2014helps catch risks that basic filtering might miss. By grouping related errors and highlighting hot spots, designers can see the big picture and focus their time where it counts. AI-based clustering algorithms reliably transform weeks of manual investigation into minutes of guided analysis.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster.</p><p>Another benefit: collaboration. By treating results as shared, living datasets\u2014rather than static tables\u2014modern tools let teams assign owners, annotate findings and pass exact analysis views between block and partition engineers, even across organizational boundaries. Dynamic bookmarks and shared UI states cut down on confusion and rework. Instead of \u201cback and forth,\u201d teams move forward together.</p><p>Many of these innovations tease at what\u2019s possible when AI is built into the heart of the verification flow. Not only do they help designers analyze the results; they help everyone reason about the data, summarize findings and make better design decisions all the way to tape out.</p><h2>A real-world breakthrough in DRC analysis and collaboration: Siemens\u2019 Calibre Vision AI</h2><p>One of the most striking examples of AI-powered DRC analysis comes from <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a>, whose <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI platform</a> is setting new standards for how full-chip verification happens. Building on years of experience in physical verification, Siemens realized that breaking bottlenecks required not only smarter algorithms but rethinking how teams work together and how data moves across the flow.</p><p>Vision AI is designed for speed and scalability. It uses a compact error database and a multi-threaded engine to load millions\u2014or even billions\u2014of errors in minutes, visualizing them so engineers see clusters and hot spots across the entire die. Instead of a wall of error codes or isolated rule violations, the tool presents a heat map of the layout, highlighting areas with the highest concentration of issues. By enabling or disabling layers (layout, markers, heat map) and adjusting layer opacity, users get a clear, customizable view of what\u2019s happening\u2014and where to look next.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. </p><p>But the real magic is in AI-guided clustering. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. This means designers can attack the root cause once, fixing problems for hundreds of checks at a time instead of tediously resolving them one by one. In cases where legacy tools would force teams to slog through, for example, 3,400 checks with 600 million errors, Vision AI\u2019s clustering can reduce that effort to investigating just 381 groups\u2014turning mountains into molehills and speeding debug time by at least 2x.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Calibre Vision software, check groups, cells list, and die-view heatmap interface screenshot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ac191\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/calibre-vision-software-check-groups-cells-list-and-die-view-heatmap-interface-screenshot.jpg?id=61784282&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 2. The Calibre Vision AI software automates and simplifies the chip-level DRC verification process.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p><span>Vision AI is also highly collaborative. Dynamic bookmarks capture the exact state of analysis, from layer filters to zoomed layout areas, along with annotations and owner assignments. Sharing a bookmark sends a living analysis\u2014not just a static snapshot\u2014to coworkers, so everyone is working from the same view. Teams can export results databases, distribute actionable groups to block owners, and seamlessly import findings into other Siemens EDA tools for further debug.</span></p><h2>Empowering every designer: reducing the expertise gap</h2><p>A frequent pain point in chip verification is the need for deep expertise\u2014knowing which errors matter, which patterns mean trouble, and how to interpret complex results. Calibre Vision AI helps level the playing field. Its AI-based algorithms consistently create the same clusters and debug paths that senior experts would identify, but does so in minutes. New users can quickly find systematic issues and perform like seasoned engineers, helping chip companies address workforce shortages and staff turnover.</p><p>Beyond clusters and bookmarks, Vision AI lets designers build custom signals by leveraging their own data. The platform secures customer models and data for exclusive use, making sure sensitive information stays within the company. And by integrating with Siemens\u2019 EDA AI ecosystem, <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> supports generative AI chatbots and reasoning assistants. Designers can ask direct questions\u2014about syntax, about a signal, about the flow\u2014and get prompt\u2014accurate answers, streamlining training and adoption.</p><h2>Real results: speeding analysis and sharing insight</h2><p>Customer feedback from leading IC companies shows the real-world value of AI for full-chip DRC analysis and debug. One company reported that Vision AI reduced their debug effort by at least half\u2014a gain that makes the difference between tapeout and delay. Another noted the platform\u2019s signals algorithm automatically creates the same check groups that experienced users would manually identify, saving not just time but energy.</p><p>Quantitative gains are dramatic. For example, Calibre Vision AI can load and visualize error files significantly faster than traditional debug flows. Figure 3 shows the difference in four different test cases: a results file that took 350 minutes with the traditional flow, took Calibre Vision AI only 31 minutes. In another test case (not shown), it took just five minutes to analyze and cluster 3.2 billion errors from more than 380 rule checks into 17 meaningful groups. Instead of getting lost in gigabytes of error data, designers now spend time solving real problems.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar graph comparing traditional flow vs. Vision AI flow times at various nanometer scales.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2f678\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/bar-graph-comparing-traditional-flow-vs-vision-ai-flow-times-at-various-nanometer-scales.jpg?id=61784294&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 3. Charting the results load time between the traditional DRC debug flow and the Calibre Vision AI flow.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><h2>Looking ahead: the future of AI in chip design</h2><p><span></span><span>Today\u2019s chips demand more than incremental improvements in EDA software. As the need for speed, quality and collaboration continues to grow, the story of physical verification will be shaped by smarter, more adaptive technologies. With AI-powered DRC analysis, we see a clear path: a faster and more productive way to find systematic issues, intelligent debug, stronger collaboration and the chance for every designer to make an expert impact.</span></p><p>By combining the creativity of engineers with the speed and insight of AI, platforms like <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> are driving a new productivity curve in full-chip analysis. With these tools, teams don\u2019t just keep up with complexity\u2014they turn it into a competitive advantage.</p><p>At Siemens, the future of chip verification is already taking shape\u2014where intelligence works hand in hand with intuition, and new ideas find their way to silicon faster than ever before. As the industry continues to push boundaries and unlock the next generation of devices, AI will help chip design reach new heights.</p><p><em>For more on Calibre Vision AI and how Siemens is shaping the future of chip design, visit <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">eda.sw.siemens.com</a> and search for Calibre Vision AI.</em></p>"

The Texas Institute for Electronics (<a href=\"https://www.txie.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TIE</a>), as it\u2019s called now, is tooling up to become the only advanced packaging plant in the world that is dedicated to 3D heterogenous integration (3DHI)\u2014the stacking of chips made of multiple materials, both silicon and non-silicon. </p><p>The fab is the infrastructure behind <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/next-generation-microelectronics\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA\u2019s Next-Generation Microelectronics Manufacturing (NGMM) program</a>. \u201cNGMM is focused on a revolution in microelectronics through 3D heterogeneous integration,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about/people/michael-holmes\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Holmes</a>, managing director of the program. </p><p>Stacking two or more silicon chips inside the same package makes them act as if they are all one integrated circuit. It already powers some of the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-mi300\" target=\"_blank\">most advanced processors</a> in the world. But DARPA predicts silicon-on-silicon stacking will result in no more than a 30-fold boost in performance over what\u2019s possible with 2D integration. By contrast, doing it with a mix of materials\u2014<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/silicon-carbide\" target=\"_blank\">gallium nitride, silicon carbide</a>, and other semiconductors\u2014could deliver a 100-fold boost, Holmes told engineers and other interested parties at the program\u2019s unofficial coming out party, the NGMM Summit, late last month.</p><p>The new fab will make sure these unusual stacked chips are prototyped and manufactured in the United States. Startups, and there were many at the launch event, are looking for a place to prototype and begin manufacturing ideas that are too weird for anywhere else\u2014and hopefully bypassing the<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_blank\"> lab-to-fab </a>valley of death that claims many hardware startups.</p><p>The state of Texas is contributing $552 million to stand up the fab and its programs, with DARPA contributing the remaining $840 million. After NGMM\u2019s five-year mission is complete, the fab is expected to be a self-sustaining business. \u201cWe are, frankly, a startup,\u201d said TIE CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwayne-labrake-aa19427/\" target=\"_blank\">Dwayne LaBrake</a>. \u201cWe have more runway than a typical startup, but we have to stand on our own.\u201d </p><h2>Starting up a 3DHI Fab</h2><p>Getting to that point will take a lot of work, but the TIE foundry is off to a quick start. On a tour of the facility, <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> saw multiple chip manufacturing and testing tools in various states of installation and met several engineers and technicians who had started within the last three months. TIE expects all the fab\u2019s tools to be in place in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>Just as important as the tools themselves is the ability of foundry customers to use them in a predictable manufacturing process. That\u2019s something that is particularly difficult to develop, TIE officials explained. At the most basic level, non-silicon wafers are  often not the same size as each other. And they have different mechanical properties, meaning they expand and contract with temperature at different rates. Yet much of the fab\u2019s work will be linking these chips together with micrometer precision.</p><p>The first phase of getting that done is the development of what are called a process design kit and an assembly design kit. The former provides the rules that constrain semiconductor design at the fab. The latter, the assembly design kit, is the real heart of things, because it gives the rules for the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_blank\">3D assembly and other advanced packaging</a>.</p><p>Next, TIE will refine those by way of three 3DHI projects, which NGMM is calling exemplars. These are a phased-array radar, an infrared imager called a focal plane array, and a compact power converter. Piloting those through production \u201cgives us an initial roadmap\u2026 an on-ramp into tremendous innovation across a broader application space,\u201d said Holmes.</p><p>These three very different products are emblematic of how the fab will have to operate once it\u2019s up and running. Executives described it as a \u201chigh-mix, low-volume\u201d foundry, meaning it\u2019s going to have to be good at doing many different things, but it\u2019s not going to make a lot of any one thing. </p><p>This is the opposite of most silicon foundries. A high-volume silicon foundry gets to run lots of similar test wafers through its process to work out the bugs. But TIE can\u2019t do that, so instead it\u2019s relying on AI\u2014developed by Austin startup <a href=\"https://sandboxsemiconductor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sandbox Semiconductor</a>\u2014to help predict the outcome of tweaks to its processes.</p><p>Along the way, NGMM will provide a number of research opportunities. \u201cWhat we have with NGMM is a very rare opportunity,\u201d said <a href=\"https://ntxsi.utdallas.edu/biography-dr-thoedore-moise/\" target=\"_blank\">Ted Moise</a>, a professor at UT Dallas and an IEEE Fellow. With NGMM, universities are planning to work on new thermal conductivity films, microfluidic cooling technology, understanding failure mechanisms in complex packages, and more.</p><p>\u201cNGMM is a weird program for DARPA,\u201d admitted <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/about/people/whitney-mason1\" target=\"_blank\">Whitney Mason</a>, director of the agency\u2019s Microsystems Technology Office. \u201cIt\u2019s not our habit to stand up facilities that do manufacturing.\u201d </p><p>But \u201cKeep Austin Weird\u201d is the city\u2019s unofficial motto, so maybe NGMM and TIE will prove a perfect fit.</p>"

Even better, its fuel costs less than a thousandth as much and weighs an eighth of the mass. A startup called </span><a href=\"https://orbitalarc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Orbital Arc</a><span> claims it can make such a thruster.</span></p><p>With this design, \u201cwe can go from a thruster that\u2019s about a few inches across and several kilograms to a thruster on a chip that\u2019s about an inch across and has the same thrust output, but weighs about an eighth as much,\u201d the company\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://orbitalarc.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Huffman</a>, says.</p><p>According to Orbital Arc the hardware would be small enough to fit on the smallest low-earth orbit satellites but generate enough power for an interplanetary mission. Such inexpensive thrust could bring meaningful savings for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/kessler-syndrome-space-debris\" target=\"_self\">satellite operators hoping to dodge debris</a>, or mission operators aiming to send probes to distant planets.</p><p>The key to these innovations is a combination of cheap, readily available fuel, MEMS microfabrication, and a strong love of sci-fi.</p><h2>Designing a Better Thruster </h2><p>Thrusters generally work by creating and then expelling a plasma, pushing a spacecraft in the opposite direction. Inside ever-popular <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hall-effect-sensor\" target=\"_self\">Hall thrusters</a>, a magnetic field traps electrons in a tight, circular orbit. A noble gas\u2014commonly xenon\u2014drifts into a narrow channel where it collides with the circulating charge knocking off electrons and ionizing it into <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amp/kessler-syndrome-plasma-thruster-deorbit-2673981482\" target=\"_self\">plasma</a>. A high-voltage electric field then rockets the plasma out the exhaust. </p><p>Orbital Arc\u2019s technology looks a bit different and came about almost coincidentally. Huffman was a biotech consultant and self-described \u201csci-fi nerd\u201d who, in his spare time, had been commissioned to design fictitious technology for a futuristic video game. He had to figure out how aircraft might maneuver 250 years from now to make the game controls realistic, and so he started researching state-of-the-art propulsion systems. </p><p>He quickly came to understand a limitation of existing ion thrusters he thought could be improved upon within the coming centuries, and (spoiler alert) possibly sooner: if a mission requires more thrust, its thruster needs to be heavier. But crucially, \u201cthere\u2019s a certain point at which adding more mass to the thruster negates all of the benefits you can get from extra thrust,\u201d he says. So, to retain those benefits, thrusters need to be small but mighty. </p><p>Huffman\u2019s familiarity with biology labs gave him an unexpected edge when it came to propulsion design. Through his job, he learned about nanoscale tips\u2014nozzles that emit ions\u2014used to generate intense electromagnetic fields for biomedical research. They\u2019re found in mass spectrometers, instruments that identify unknown chemicals by converting them into ions, accelerating them, and watching how they fly.</p><p>He suspected that such a system could be miniaturized even more to make the ionization process in a thruster. After a year and a half of developing the concept, Huffman was convinced that his idea for a small thruster had potential beyond a video game. </p><p>And he was right. Each Orbital Arc thruster has a chip at its heart with millions of micrometer-scale, positively charged tips embedded in it and channels to direct gas flow\u2014naphthalene flows in, and ions flow out. </p><p>As naphthalene molecules pass the charged tips, the molecules<strong> </strong>become polarized\u2014here, that means a molecule\u2019s electrons bunch up on one of its sides. Because of the uneven field created by the charge, the molecules get dragged towards a tip and are then trapped there, unable to escape until they release electrons. </p><p>Once they release electrons, \u201cyou have an ion that\u2019s at the point of a really sharp positively charged object, and it itself is now positively charged. So it accelerates,\u201d Huffman explains. The repelled ions fly by and spray out into space, propelling the spacecraft forward.</p><p>An advantage of this design is the power savings that come from avoiding the internal plasma generation that other thrusters rely on, Huffman says. \u201cPlasmas have losses because everything\u2019s in a big soup mixed together,\u201d Huffman explains. Free electrons in a plasma can recombine with ions to produce neutral atoms \u201cand now I\u2019ve lost the energy that I put in to make that charged particle. It\u2019s a waste of power.\u201d Recent calculations show the naphthalene nanotip thruster providing a 30 to 40 percent improvement in power efficiency, he claims.</p><p>By avoiding plasmas all together, the Orbital Arc design is able to capitalize on the power savings, as shown in a recent demonstration. In a recent test, just six of Orbital Arc\u2019s tips were able to generate about three times more ion current than an array of 320,000 tips from a group from MIT, Huffman says.</p><p>Two and a half years after his \u201caha\u201d moment (and after \u201cbuilding the whole darn thing in Excel\u201d), Huffman is the CEO of Orbital Arc, a startup testing four working prototypes of its tiny tips-on-chips. </p><p>The thruster is not only innovative for its size, but also for its fuel. Naphthalene\u2014the main ingredient of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothball\" target=\"_blank\">mothballs</a>\u2014is a readily available byproduct of oil refineries. The compound may smell bad, but it\u2019s safe to handle and extremely cheap, Huffman says, costing around US $1.50 per kilogram compared to some $3,000 per kilogram for xenon.</p><p>Orbital Arc\u2019s use of naphthalene aids in their shrinking of product costs, which the company claims is at one percent of traditional Hall thrusters. \u201cI think that\u2019s believable,\u201d says <a href=\"https://alfven.princeton.edu/about/personnel/jonathan_macarthur/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan MacArthur</a>, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University\u2019s Electric Propulsion and Plasma Dynamics Laboratory. \u201cWhat remains to be seen is, okay, it\u2019s cheap, but if I put diesel in my gas car because it\u2019s on sale, that doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for the engine in my car.\u201d He wishes the startup would release data to back up their cost claims\u2014and while they\u2019re at it, data to back up performance claims, as well.</p><h2>From Prototype to Flight</h2><p>For now, in the prototype stage, each chip contains only six tips, fabricated using MEMS manufacturing processes in a cleanroom at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. But the next step is to manufacture a full-scale version of the chip in a university lab, Huffman says.</p><p>Then, the company will need to build the thruster that goes around the chip. \u201cThat\u2019s a relatively simple device. It\u2019s a valve, it\u2019s a few wires, it\u2019s a few structural components. Very, very straightforward,\u201d Huffman claims. He says he\u2019ll need to integrate all of those parts before running through vibration testing, radiation testing, thermal cycling, and other steps on the way to achieve flight qualification. \u201cTwo years from now, I can have a product that is sellable, probably.\u201d</p><p>Huffman thinks Orbital Arc\u2019s initial customers would be small teams, like startups or research groups. He\u2019s confident that they\u2019ll be willing to try the new thrusters, despite the risks inherent to new technologies, because of the expected performance at low cost. \u201cSo some folks just won\u2019t have any choice but to buy it, even if it hasn\u2019t flown before. If they want to do the mission, they\u2019re going to take the risk,\u201d he says.</p><p>Princeton\u2019s MacArthur is skeptical of that claim. \u201cWhen you\u2019re choosing a propulsion system, generally data and heritage is everything.\u201d He\u2019s not so sure that customers will be willing to take on the risk of a new thruster without a history of flight. </p><p>Still, some CubeSat-scale missions may agree to use new thrusters at a discount, suggests <a href=\"https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/jia-richards-oliver/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oliver Jia-Richards</a>, who studies in-space propulsion at the University of Michigan. Customers may also be willing to take a chance on Orbital Arc because other startups, like <a href=\"https://www.enpulsion.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Enpulsion</a>, have been recently successful with their new electric propulsion technology, he says. But \u201cwith this kind of thing, there\u2019s always risks.\u201d</p><p>After targeting small missions, Huffman wants to \u201cbuild something where we show off a bit.\u201d He notes that, as of yet, no satellite has completed a round trip to the moon after a year in Earth\u2019s orbit without refueling. It\u2019s funding dependent and there may be more attractive opportunities that come up, \u201cso we\u2019ll see,\u201d he says.</p><p>And he\u2019s not stopping there. \u201cWe are tapping into a mathematical reality,\u201d Huffman says. \u201cIf you cut dry mass off of spacecraft, you gain exponential benefits in its performance because of the way the rocket equation works. You get exponentially penalized for extra dry mass.\u201d </p><p>By integrating Orbital Arc\u2019s thrusters, he says, a mission could cut solar panel and power supply mass because it drive is more power efficient, cut tank mass because naphthalene doesn\u2019t require a pressure vessel unlike xenon, and cut thruster mass itself. With these savings, \u201cyou go from flying one-way science missions to Mars to flying two-way human rated missions to Jupiter without refueling,\u201d Huffman claims.</p><p>So while the thruster is Orbital Arc\u2019s first step, Huffman envisions an ultra-light spacecraft bus next\u2014arriving long before the far-future era of the video game that inspired it.</p>"

Unlike AIS, which tracks only a ship\u2019s position, Co-Captain also monitors onboard conditions. For example, if a ship reports a pitch of 3 degrees and a roll of 5 degrees in rough seas, Co-Captain uses that data to anticipate how current conditions will impact nearby ships, adjusted for their size and design. Co-Captain then sends tailored recommendations to those vessels\u2019 crews.</p><p>\u201cEvery ship acts as a node in a larger network, and each node\u2014the vessel itself\u2014has an onboard AI platform.

Gross says that a ship\u2019s movements, timing, or route can reveal valuable information. \u201cBy anonymizing the data, Co-Captain can share critical safety alerts such as GPS interference, severe weather, or high traffic without ever exposing which vessel reported it or where it came from.\u201d</p><p>Gross says that Orca AI is working on integrating Co-Captain with more bridge systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/navtex-maritime-safety-broadcasts\" target=\"_blank\">Navigational Telex</a> (NAVTEX) and ECDIS, so that relevant alerts and updates are centralized.</p><p>The company\u2019s long-term goal is to provide real-time notifications focused on the most important events along a ship\u2019s route, giving captains information they can act on quickly to support safer and more efficient operations.

Gupta is a manager of data and analytics engineering for Discover, and he works from Raleigh, N.C.</p><p>\u201cThe innovations my fraud department has developed have helped my organization respond to threats faster and adapt more easily to future needs,\u201d he says.</p><p>This year, he received Discover\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pankaj-gupta-discover_im-truly-honored-to-receive-the-2025-presidents-activity-7316862305072279553-vNZc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">President\u2019s Award</a>, the company\u2019s highest employee recognition. It is given to those who have achieved outstanding business results while demonstrating the company\u2019s values.</p><p>Gupta also became an invited member of the<a href=\"https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Pankaj-Gupta-Manager-Data-Engineering-Discover-Financial-services/e4b1ce85-390f-4966-ac88-e03bb40cdae9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Forbes Technology Council</a>, a community of experienced leaders across industries, selected based on their professional achievements and leadership experience.</p><p>He says he enjoys his job but says he never meant to work in financial services, a field where he has built a nearly two-decade-long career.</p><h2>From electrical engineering to software development</h2><p>As a youngster, he was curious about how things worked and would take apart gadgets his father brought home.</p><p>\u201cMy father worked at <a href=\"https://www.bsnl.co.in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BSNL</a>, a government telecom organization, and often took me to his office,\u201d Gupta says. \u201cThere I would watch phones in operation and telecom operators connecting trunk calls. At home, we even had a few old, nonfunctional phones lying around.\u201d</p><p>While at school, he enjoyed participating in science and math olympiads and exhibitions, he says.</p><p>Taking note of his curiosity and his problem-solving skills, his teachers encouraged him to study engineering. He was most interested in learning electrical engineering because of his interest in the power substations that he and his father checked out.</p><p>\u201cGrowing up in a small town [Dongargarh, which is famous for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambleshwari_Temple\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bamleshwari Temple</a>, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site], I saw how technology could help solve problems and make life better for people,\u201d he says.</p><p>He also became fascinated by the nearby steel factory\u2019s massive machines, its chimneys, and the constant activity around them, he says.</p><p>\u201cI noticed how everything seemed to work together in a coordinated way. Seeing such complex engineering in action at such a young age planted the seed of my interest in technology,\u201d he says. \u201cThis exposure inspired me to pursue electrical engineering as a career.\u201d</p><p>In 2002 he enrolled in the EE program at the <a href=\"https://ccetbhilai.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Christian College of Engineering and Technology</a>, in Bhilai, India, a 180-minute commute each way by train. He left at 5 a.m. and returned at 6:30 p.m. During his senior year, his family began struggling financially, he says, so his priority was to find a job immediately after graduating to support them.</p><p>In India, universities hold placement events on campus to recruit graduating students. Gupta says he was lucky enough to receive a job offer from the Indian IT company <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahindra_Satyam\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Satyam Computer Services</a>, which is now defunct. He started there in 2006 after earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering and electrical engineering. Satyam assigned him to work on a software program for a financial services company.</p><p>That\u2019s when he pivoted to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vibe-coding\" target=\"_blank\">software engineering</a>.</p><p>Gupta says that although software development wasn\u2019t his preferred career path, it enabled him to support himself and his parents.</p><p>He still has a soft spot for electrical engineering, he says, but he hasn\u2019t changed fields or industries for the past 18 years.</p><p>His time at a variety of financial institutions has allowed him to travel the world to work in other countries including Germany and the United Kingdom, he says. The United States is the fourth country where he has worked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting journey, learning about different work cultures and technologies,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Using AI and machine learning to combat fraud</h2><p>Gupta left Satyam in 2011 to join <a href=\"https://www.mphasis.com/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mphasis</a>, an IT solutions company in Bangalore, India, as a senior software developer focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. After a year, he left for <a href=\"https://www.wipro.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wipro Technologies</a> in Bengaluru. As a technical lead, he was assigned as a consultant for Capital One in Bangalore in an offshore development center. He led a team of 10 employees working on data integration projects including generic frameworks.</p><p>He moved to the United States in 2017 to work as an associate vice president at <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JPMorgan Chase</a> in Jersey City, N.J. He helped create a world-class analytics platform and modernize the bank\u2019s reporting systems. He also worked on systems that use a zero-trust security approach, which he describes as one whereby banks do not automatically trust any user or system. Instead, they verify every transaction.</p><p>\u201cThis greatly reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access,\u201d he says.</p><p>He also developed scalable data partitioning techniques that organize and split large volumes of information into more manageable pieces.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cI believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.\u201d</span></p><p>\u201cThis allows the system to process data more quickly, handle growth without slowing down, and support real-time decision-making,\u201d he says. \u201cThese innovations have helped my organization respond to threats faster.\u201d</p><p>He joined Discover in 2019 and has worked his way up from principal data engineer for the data and analytics group to manager of data engineering. He developed AI-enhanced data pipelines to train models in making real-time, automated decisions.</p><p>AI and machine learning systems can prevent fraudulent transactions by collecting information about a customer\u2019s typical financial habits over time, such as whether banking is done online or through an app, the time of day transactions occur, and the typical amount paid to creditors. The system is then trained to look for anomalies.</p><p>In simple terms, the system assigns a risk score to each transaction, usually on a scale based on patterns it has learned, Gupta says. If the score crosses a certain threshold, the bank might take preventive action. If, for instance, there is an unusual purchase in a location far from where the customer lives, the bank will send the customer a message, looking to verify whether the transaction is legitimate. If the customer does not recognize the purchase, the bank blocks the transaction.</p><h2>Staying connected to tech pros</h2><p>Gupta joined IEEE in 2023 \u201cto connect with a global network of technology professionals, and to stay updated in the latest advancements in engineering and computing,\u201d he says. He was elevated to senior member later that year.</p><p>\u201cMembership has helped me access world-class research through the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6461145\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Xplore Digital Library</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also provided me an opportunity to attend <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/conferences-events\" target=\"_blank\">conferences</a> and share my expertise with the wider engineering community.\u201d</p><h2>AI\u2019s impact on engineering</h2><p>His advice for young engineers is to stay curious and keep learning.</p><p>\u201cTechnology is changing very rapidly,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is working right now might change in six months, so adaptability is your biggest strength.\u201d</p><p>He predicts that AI agents will eventually take over repetitive tasks such as those related to automation, coding, and programming. Where engineers will be most needed, he says, is building AI models and training them.</p><p>\u201cEngineers will find significant opportunities for growth in these areas,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.</p><p>\u201cFocus on solving real problems, not just building solutions for their own sake.</p><p>\u201cBuild your professional network and seek mentors who can guide you through both technical and career challenges.\u201d</p>"
