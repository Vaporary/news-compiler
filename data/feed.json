AGI makes it feasible to perform all economically valuable work using compute. I distinguish between bottleneck and supplementary work\u2014tasks that are essential versus non-essential for unhindered growth. As computational resources expand: (i) the economy automates all bottleneck work, (ii) some supplementary work may be left exclusively to humans, (iii) output becomes linear in compute and labor and its growth is driven by the expansion of compute, (iv) wages converge to the opportunity cost of computational resources required to reproduce human work, and (v) the share of labor income in GDP converges to zero."

We derive pricing formulas that depart from profit maximization by incorporating incentives to improve welfare and reduce labor disruptions. Using US data, we evaluate several scenarios. A welfarist firm that values both profit and welfare should price closer to marginal cost, as efficiency gains outweigh distributional concerns. A conservative firm focused on labor-market stability should price above the profit-maximizing level in the short run, especially when its AI may displace low-income workers. Overall, socially minded firms face a trade-off between expanding access to AI and the resulting loss in profits and labor market risks."

        "summary": "This paper demonstrates that ignoring the source of variation in tariff levels yields misleading conclusions regarding the effects of tariff changes. Specifically, we show that changes in the ad valorem equivalent (AVE) tariff are insufficient to quantify the magnitude or sign of the effect of tariff changes on economic outcomes. To illustrate this point, we construct the first database of annual US statutory tariffs from 1972 to 1988 and use it to explore the consequences of liberalization in the years spanning the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Decomposing the aggregate AVE into its statutory and endogenous components, we document two distinct liberalizations in our sample. Prior to 1979, inflation combines with specific tariffs to create an \u201caccidental liberalization\u201d, despite the absence of widespread statutory tariff changes. After 1979, endogenous changes in the composition of imports mask the large Tokyo Round statutory tariff liberalization. Generalizing an exact hat framework to accommodate specific tariffs, we show that inflation-driven reductions in AVEs account for roughly half of the tariff liberalization in our sample, but these changes ultimately reduce imports and welfare. Finally, we show that specific tariffs remain an important determinant of cross-sectional variation in AVEs: between 2000 and 2017, one-third to one-half of the annual cross-sectional variance in good-level AVEs is driven by variation in the AVE of specific tariffs."

        "summary": "Policymakers often cite the risk that inflation expectations might \u201cde-anchor\u201d as a key reason for responding forcefully to inflationary shocks. We develop a model to analyze this trade-off and to quantify the benefits of stable long-run inflation expectations. In our framework, households and firms are imperfectly informed about the central bank\u2019s objective and learn from its policy choices. Recognizing this interaction, the central bank raises interest rates more aggressively after adverse supply shocks and accepts short-run output costs to secure more stable inflation expectations. The strength of this reputation channel depends on how sensitive long-run inflation expectations are to surprises in interest rates. Using high-frequency identification, we estimate these elasticities for emerging and advanced economies and find large negative values for Brazil. We fit our model to these findings and use it to quantify how reputation building motives affect monetary policy decisions, and the role of central bank's credibility in promoting macroeconomic stability."

        "summary": "This paper studies the cost-effectiveness of targeted payroll taxes for stimulating labor demand. It uses rich administrative data to study the effects of an Italian reform that raised social security contributions for apprenticeship contracts but granted a substantial discount for firms with 9 employees or less. The discount does not increase demand for apprenticeship contracts. Instead, it subsidizes inframarginal hiring. This reform is not cost-effective. Point estimates imply that each million euros of foregone social security contributions supports the employment of 29 apprentices for one year and no permanent contracts (these estimates are not statistically different from zero)."

Combining data on county-level erosion, the historical geography of crop production, and crop-specific innovation, I document that in the wake of the environmental crisis, agricultural technology development was strongly and persistently re-directed toward more Dust Bowl-exposed crops and, within crops, toward bio-chemical and planting technologies that could directly mitigate economic losses from environmental distress. County-level exposure to Dust Bowl-induced innovation significantly dampened the effect of land erosion on agricultural land values and revenue. These results highlight the role of crises in spurring innovation and the importance of endogenous technological progress as an adaptive force in the face of disasters."

        "summary": "We ask to what extent the quantification of labor market power depends on the modeling of the long-term worker-firm employment relationship. We develop an oligopsony model with dynamic wage contracts. Workers decide whether and where to work, choosing among firms providing different amenities and solving a dynamic discrete choice labor supply problem with firm-specific human capital. As a result, firms optimally choose wage-tenure contracts to attract and retain workers. We find that such contracts mitigate firms' incentives to impose large instantaneous wage markdowns\u2014compared to standard static wage-setting models\u2014thereby reducing the share of socially inefficient worker-firm separations. As a consequence, we show that the empirical approaches based on \"sufficient statistics\" tend to overestimate the extent of labor market power: low levels of firm-specific labor supply elasticities do not necessarily indicate rent extraction, but instead reflect firms\u2019 ability to retain workers by offering long-term value through human capital accumulation."

AI is making warfare more precise and deadly amidst intransigent conflicts. AI companies are exploiting people in the global South who work as data labelers, and profiting from content creators worldwide by using their work without license or compensation. The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" target=\"_blank\">enormous energy demands</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, particularly in the United States, public investment in science seems to be <a href=\"https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/leading-research-universities-report/white-house-proposes-steep-cuts-science-and-education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>redirected</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/trump-plan-highlights-ai-for-science\" target=\"_blank\">concentrated</a> on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And Big Tech companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.</p><p>This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here\u2019s how.</p><h2>The Academy\u2019s View of AI <a target=\"_blank\"></a></h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Pew study</span></a> in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn\u2019t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 <a href=\"https://sci-ops.org/survey/artificial-intelligence-survey-x/scientists-perceptions-and-personal-use/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of generative AI in daily life\u2014by nearly a three to one ratio.</p><p>We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, cybersecurity, physical sciences, drug discovery, public health, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we\u2019ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we\u2019ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.</p><p>We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.</p><h2>Elements of a Positive Vision for AI</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/working-waterfront/hope-a-framework-for-climate-action/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7178677/climate-scientist-optimist-refuse-to-give-up-hope/\" target=\"_blank\">have</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">rgu</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">ed</a> <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that</a> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">turn</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ing</a> the <a href=\"https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/making-case-climate-optimism\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tide</a> of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.</p><p>There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples\u2019 lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.</p><p>Some examples: AI is eliminating communication barriers across languages, including under-resourced contexts like <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5230744\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>marginalized sign languages</span></a> and <a href=\"https://ojs.bilpub.com/index.php/card/article/view/517\" target=\"_blank\">indigenous African languages</a>. It is helping policymakers incorporate the viewpoints of many constituents through AI-assisted <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adq2852\" target=\"_blank\">deliberations</a> and <a href=\"https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legislative engagement</a>.

National labs are building AI <a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/cels/auroragpt-foundation-models-for-science\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">foundation models</a> to accelerate scientific research. And throughout the fields of medicine and biology, machine learning is solving scientific problems like the prediction of protein structure in aid of drug discovery, which was recognized with a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Prize</a> in 2024.</p><p>While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.</p><h2><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>A Call to Action for Scientists</h2><p>In our new book, <span><em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\">Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship</a></em></span><span>, we describe four key actions for policymakers committed to steering AI toward the public good.</span></p><p>These apply to scientists as well. Researchers should work to <strong>reform</strong> the AI industry to be more ethical, equitable, and trustworthy. We must collectively<a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"><span>develop</span></a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\">ethical</a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\">norms</a> for research that advance and applies AI, and should use and draw attention to AI developers who adhere to those norms. </p><p>Second, we should <strong>resist</strong> harmful uses of AI by documenting the negative applications of AI and casting a light on inappropriate uses. </p><p>Third, we should <strong>responsibly use</strong> AI to make society and peoples\u2019 lives better, exploiting its capabilities to help the communities they serve. </p><p>And finally, we must advocate for the <strong>renovation</strong> of institutions to prepare them for the impacts of AI; universities, professional societies, and democratic organizations are all vulnerable to disruption.</p><p>Scientists have a special privilege and responsibility: We are close to the technology itself and therefore well positioned to influence its trajectory. We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Melvin Kranzberg observed</span></a>, \u201cis neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today.

But this high-altitude confab is no Victorian perambulation. It\u2019s a vital component of a sprawling, cutting-edge project that is pushing the boundaries of bioinformatics and the tools of modern genomics. These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of<a href=\"https://www.projectpsyche.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Project Psyche</a>, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. <a href=\"https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9760/\" target=\"_blank\">Psyche</a> is part of a larger effort, the<a href=\"https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Darwin Tree of Life project</a>, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the<a href=\"https://www.earthbiogenome.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Earth BioGenome Project</a>. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of <em><em>all</em></em> of Earth\u2019s roughly 1.8 million organisms\u2014every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that\u2019s made up of cells that have a nucleus.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\"><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a></p><p>None of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it\u2019s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal\u2014to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035\u2014won\u2019t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>But the project\u2019s success may ultimately hinge on functions <em><em>other</em></em> than sequencing. For example, after a creature\u2019s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data\u2014consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs\u2014must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, <em><em>before</em></em> an organism\u2019s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it\u2019s an animal, capture it.

By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, \u201cwe can find out how they have evolved and how they\u2019ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.\u201d</p><p>Those genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell\u2019s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature\u2019s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01098-X\" target=\"_blank\"> Atlas blue butterfly</a>, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.</p><p>The Atlas blue is \u201ca very good example of something that\u2019s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,\u201d says Meier. \u201cWhat we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications\u201d\u2014thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. \u201cThen we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, \u2018What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that\u2019s broken?\u2019 \u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Some three dozen species of Lepidoptera are seen pinned to a display board, with tiny hand-written notes associated with each one.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a9f32\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/some-three-dozen-species-of-lepidoptera-are-seen-pinned-to-a-display-board-with-tiny-hand-written-notes-associated-with-each-on.jpg?id=61998921&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>And it\u2019s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data.

He\u2019s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he\u2019s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it\u2019s black). He\u2019s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth\u2019s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.</p><p>The objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different \u201cmicroenvironments,\u201d he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there\u2019s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young man in a bright blue T-shirt and black cargo pants standing on a slope amid brilliant purple wildflowers swings a bright yellow butterfly net.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"70ee6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-man-in-a-bright-blue-t-shirt-and-black-cargo-pants-standing-on-a-slope-amid-brilliant-purple-wildflowers-swings-a-brigh.jpg?id=61998951&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Genetics researcher No\u00e9 Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Luigi Avantaggiato        </small></p><p>\u201cOver there\u201d\u2014he points across the valley to the opposite slope. \u201cIt faces north.

There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they\u2019ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

It\u2019s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can\u2019t even fly at night or in the rain. \u201cButterflies are just day-flying moths,\u201d Wahlberg quips. \u201cPeople think of them as different and special, but they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>In this new era of mass genome sequencing, they\u2019re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera\u2014about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 European Lepidoptera species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg\u2019s reckoning. And they\u2019ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.</p><p>So the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the<a href=\"https://www.lesfruitsdemer.com/wild-statia-what-are-micromoths/\" target=\"_blank\"> micromoths</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/size-really-doesnt-matter-when-it-comes-to-micro-and-macro-moths.html\" target=\"_blank\">Micromoths</a> have long vexed entomologists. The largest of them have wingspans about as wide as a U.S. dime, or a 2 euro cent coin; <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/tiniest-moths-in-the-world.html\" target=\"_blank\">the smallest</a> can fit on the head of a pin. As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as \u201cmacromoths\u201d). There are a <em><em>lot</em></em> of micromoths\u2014at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young woman stands at night next to a plastic vessel, about a meter tall, which is lit from within by a purple glow.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d5d8d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-woman-stands-at-night-next-to-a-plastic-vessel-about-a-meter-tall-which-is-lit-from-within-by-a-purple-glow.jpg?id=61999056&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>That\u2019s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes.

It\u2019s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there\u2019s a mitochondrial gene, called<a href=\"https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1937-the-ideal-barcoding-gene\" target=\"_blank\"> CO1</a>, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. \u201cWe have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,\u201d Wahlberg says. \u201cAnd only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/dna-barcoding-species-detection-and-high-throughput-assays-71860\" target=\"_blank\">DNA barcoding</a> was invented in the early 2000s by<a href=\"https://scienceline.org/2008/02/tweed-bio-dnabarcoding/\" target=\"_blank\"> Paul Hebert</a> and colleagues at the<a href=\"https://www.uoguelph.ca/\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Guelph</a>, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it.

The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-9-214\" target=\"_blank\"> 100 to 250 base pairs</a>. Conversely, \u201csuper-barcodes,\u201d which can be many thousands of base pairs, are useful for differentiating among closely related species\u2014exactly the challenge with many of the micromoths.</p><h2>Why RNA Will Make Annotating Faster</h2><p>While the Psyche researchers honed the logistics and mechanics of sampling Lepidoptera, a different European Lepidoptera project was quietly making a technical advance that could resonate throughout the Earth BioGenome Project.

And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,\u201d of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.</p><p>Gut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\"> ribonucleic acid</a>. When a gene creates, or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hudsonalpha.org/edna-gene-expression/\" target=\"_blank\">expresses</a>,\u201d a protein, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\">RNA</a> acts as the \u201cmessenger,\u201d carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.</p><p>The breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a>, in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>.\u201d] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations\u2014CNAG, the<a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Centre for Genomic Regulation</a> (CRG), the<a href=\"https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Institute of Evolutionary Biology</a> at Pompeu Fabra University, and the<a href=\"https://web.ub.edu/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Barcelona</a>\u2014and from<a href=\"https://ari.ad/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Andorra Research and Innovation</a>, in Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria.</p><p>The genome of the female <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaena_helle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">violet copper butterfly</a>, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs. By using long-read sequencing of the RNA in the sample, the researchers were able to identify 20,122 protein-coding genes and 4,264 noncoding genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4687140/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">very difficult to predict by computational means</a>. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says <a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/roderic_guigo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Roderic Guig\u00f3 Serra</a>, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.</p><p>\u201cLong-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,\u201d he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, \u201cwe get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,\u201d Serra declares.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A woman wearing a white lab coat and lavender gloves holds a pipette above a black colored box roughly the size of desktop printer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"27c81\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-wearing-a-white-lab-coat-and-lavender-gloves-holds-a-pipette-above-a-black-colored-box-roughly-the-size-of-desktop-print.jpg?id=61999110&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the Guig\u00f2 Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>His group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species\u2014including humans. They\u2019re doing this through <a href=\"https://www.gencodegenes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gencode</a>, an international consortium that aims to produce improved, \u201creference\u201d annotations for the human and mouse genomes. Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it\u2014particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39554180/\" target=\"_blank\">18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes</a>. \u201cThese genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,\u201d says Serra.</p><p>Researchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world\u2019s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe\u2019s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.</p><p>It\u2019s a mammoth task. As they grapple with it, its practitioners can take inspiration from the novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov. \u201cMy loathings are simple,\u201d<a href=\"https://dianedooley.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/the-strong-opinions-of-vladimir-nabokov/\" target=\"_blank\"> he wrote in 1973</a>. \u201cStupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music.

But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. \u201cIt sometimes could be a lonely experience,\u201d says Berry. \u201cRepresentation does matter.\u201d</p><p>Now, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at <a href=\"https://www.rose-hulman.edu/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three people of color, including Professor Carlotta Berry in the center,  talk about a tabletop modular robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c4601\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-people-of-color-including-professor-carlotta-berry-in-the-center-talk-about-a-tabletop-modular-robot.jpg?id=62000379&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</small></p><p><span>She also works to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/supporting-black-scholars-in-robotics\" target=\"_blank\">support people of color in engineering</a>. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. \u201cThis was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,\u201d says Berry, noting that today only about </span><a href=\"https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/only-8-electronics-engineering-workforce-are-women\" target=\"_blank\">8 percent</a><span> of electronics engineers are women and about </span><a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/electrical-engineer-jobs/demographics/\" target=\"_blank\">5 percent</a><span> are Black. \u201cIt was time for something to change.\u201d</span></p><h2>Berry\u2019s Path to Teaching</h2><p>As a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school\u2014especially math\u2014and thought she\u2019d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what an engineer was,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone who was an engineer.\u201d After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.gatech.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> as part of a dual degree program with <a href=\"https://www.spelman.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Spelman College</a>, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s in mathematics in 1992.</p><p>After her bachelor\u2019s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master\u2019s in electrical engineering and control systems at <a href=\"https://wayne.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wayne State University</a> in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. \u201cI really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,\u201d she says. </p><p>After a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Vanderbilt University</a> in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school\u2014and at last found herself on the right career path: \u201cI always wanted to be an educator,\u201d she says. </p><h2>A Turn Toward Outreach</h2><p>Berry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three women of color sit in front of signs about Girls in STEM. A multitude of small wheeled robots are on the floor in front of them.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"58516\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-women-of-color-sit-in-front-of-signs-about-girls-in-stem-a-multitude-of-small-wheeled-robots-are-on-the-floor-in-front-of.jpg?id=62000351&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Berry hopes to support women of color in STEM through public events. Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman\u2019s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Griffin Museum of Science and Industry</small></p><p>\u201cAs a full professor, I don\u2019t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I provide education for students and for the community, that\u2019s also part of my research and service.\u201d <span>For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.</span></p><p>Since 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, \u201cto the streets.\u201d</p><p>Berry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/sphero-indi-brings-robotics-to-prekindergarten\" target=\"_blank\">kids just a few years old</a> to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, \u201cvisibility matters.\u201d</p><p>With any audience, Berry is always \u201cvery approachable and very engaging,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicki-manion/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicki Manion</a>, a program manager for Rose-Hulman\u2019s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.</p><p>\u201cI have to go where people are,\u201d Berry says. \u201cI get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.\u201d</p><p>This past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics\u2014sense, plan, act\u2014the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.</p><p>Last year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.</p><h2>Online Community and Writing</h2><p><span>Berry hasn\u2019t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded <a href=\"https://blackinengineering.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Engineering</a> and <a href=\"https://blackinrobotics.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Robotics</a>\u2014part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it\u2019s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. \u201cThere were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,\u201d she says.</span></p><p>Her professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: \u201cThat was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.\u201d In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the <a href=\"https://swe.org/magazine/dee-award-berry-22/\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Women Engineers</a> and <a href=\"https://ghc.anitab.org/awards-programs/abie-awards\" target=\"_blank\">AnitaB.org</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"The book cover for There's a Robot in My Closet, by Dr. Carlotta A.

During that time, Berry woke up from a dream and remembered only the title of a children\u2019s book she knew she had to write: <em><em>There\u2019s a Robot in My Closet</em></em>. <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/theres-a-robot-in-my-closet-carlotta-a-berry/1145214444\" target=\"_blank\">The book</a> spawned a series, which features kid protagonists learning how to program robots and developing their problem-solving skills. (<span>Berry also writes STEM-centered </span><span>romance novels</span><span> for adults under the pseudonym Carlotta Ardell. The heroine of h</span><span>er book </span><em><em>Elevated Inferno</em></em><span>, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life\u2014an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) </span></p><p>While balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds \u201csee themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.\u201d</p>"

Every leap\u2014whether it\u2019s smarter phones, more capable cars, or breakthroughs in healthcare and science\u2014relies on chips that are more complex, faster, and packed with more features than ever before. But creating these chips is not just a question of sheer engineering talent or ambition. The design process itself has reached staggering levels of complexity, and with it, the challenge to keep productivity and quality moving forward.</p><p>As we push against the boundaries of physics, chipmakers face more than just technical hurdles. The workforce challenges, tight timelines, and the requirements for building reliable chips are stricter than ever. Enormous effort goes into making sure chip layouts follow detailed constraints\u2014such as maintaining minimum feature sizes for transistors and wires, keeping proper spacing between different layers like metal, polysilicon, and active areas, and ensuring vias overlap correctly to create solid electrical connections. These design rules multiply with every new technology generation. For every innovation, there\u2019s pressure to deliver more with less. So, the question becomes: How do we help designers meet these demands, and how can technology help us handle the complexity without compromising on quality?</p><h2>Shifting the paradigm: the rise of AI in electronic design automation</h2><p>A major wave of change is moving through the entire field of electronic design automation (EDA), the specialized area of software and tools that chipmakers use to design, analyze, and verify the complex integrated circuits inside today\u2019s chips. Artificial intelligence is already touching many parts of the chip design flow\u2014helping with placement and routing, predicting yield outcomes, tuning analog circuits, automating simulation, and even guiding early architecture planning. Rather than simply speeding up old steps, AI is opening doors to new ways of thinking and working.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>Instead of brute-force computation or countless lines of custom code, AI uses advanced algorithms to spot patterns, organize massive datasets, and highlight issues that might otherwise take weeks of manual work to uncover. For example, generative AI can help designers ask questions and get answers in natural language, streamlining routine tasks. Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>This growing partnership between human expertise and machine intelligence is paving the way for what some call a \u201cshift left\u201d or concurrent build revolution\u2014finding and fixing problems much earlier in the design process, before they grow into expensive setbacks. For chipmakers, this means higher quality and faster time to market. For designers, it means a chance to focus on innovation rather than chasing bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Flow diagram: IC design rule checking (DRC), SoC integration, physical verification showing errors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c40c3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/flow-diagram-ic-design-rule-checking-drc-soc-integration-physical-verification-showing-errors.jpg?id=61784279&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 1. Shift-left and concurrent build of IC chips performs multiple tasks simultaneously that use to be done sequentially.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><h2>The physical verification bottleneck: why design rule checking is harder than ever</h2><p><span></span><span>As chips grow more complex, the part of the design called physical verification becomes a critical bottleneck. Physical verification checks whether a chip layout meets the manufacturer\u2019s strict rules and faithfully matches the original functional schematic. Its main goal is to ensure the design can be reliably manufactured into a working chip, free of physical defects that might cause failures later on.</span></p><p>Design rule checking (DRC) is the backbone of physical verification. DRC software scans every corner of a chip\u2019s layout for violations\u2014features that might cause defects, reduce yield, or simply make the design un-manufacturable. But today\u2019s chips aren\u2019t just bigger; they\u2019re more intricate, woven from many layers of logic, memory, and analog components, sometimes stacked in three dimensions. The rules aren\u2019t simple either. They may depend on the geometry, the context, the manufacturing process and even the interactions between distant layout features.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man with wavy black hair in a black blazer and white shirt against a plain background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12f34\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-with-wavy-black-hair-in-a-black-blazer-and-white-shirt-against-a-plain-background.jpg?id=61784318&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Priyank Jain leads product management for Calibre Interfaces at Siemens EDA.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p>Traditionally, DRC is performed late in the flow, when all components are assembled into the final chip layout. At this stage, it\u2019s common to uncover millions of violations\u2014and fixing these late-stage issues requires extensive effort, leading to costly delays.</p><p>To minimize this burden, there\u2019s a growing focus on shifting DRC earlier in the flow\u2014a strategy called \u201cshift-left.\u201d Instead of waiting until the entire design is complete, engineers try to identify and address DRC errors much sooner at block and cell levels. This concurrent design and verification approach allows the bulk of errors to be caught when fixes are faster and less disruptive.</p><p>However, running DRC earlier in the flow on a full chip when the blocks are not DRC clean produces results datasets of breathtaking scale\u2014often tens of millions to billions of \u201cerrors,\u201d warnings, or flags because the unfinished chip design is \u201cdirty\u201d compared to a chip that\u2019s been through the full design process. Navigating these \u201cdirty\u201d results is a challenge all on its own. Designers must prioritize which issues to tackle, identify patterns that point to systematic problems, and decide what truly matters. In many cases, this work is slow and \u201cmanual,\u201d depending on the ability of engineers to sort through data, filter what matters, and share findings across teams.</p><p>To cope, design teams have crafted ways to limit the flood of information. They might cap the number of errors per rule, or use informal shortcuts\u2014passing databases or screenshots by email to team members, sharing filters in chat messages, and relying on experts to know where to look. Yet this approach is not sustainable. It risks missing major, chip-wide issues that can cascade through the final product. It slows down response and makes collaboration labor-intensive.</p><p>With ongoing workforce challenges and the surging complexity of modern chips, the need for smarter, more automated DRC analysis becomes urgent. So what could a better solution look like\u2014and how can AI help bridge the gap?</p><h2>The rise of AI-powered DRC analysis</h2><p>Recent breakthroughs in AI have changed the game for DRC analysis in ways that were unthinkable even a few years ago. Rather than scanning line by line or check by check, AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster. These tools use techniques from computer vision, advanced machine learning, and big data analytics to turn what once seemed like an impossible pile of information into a roadmap for action.</p><p>AI\u2019s ability to organize chaotic datasets\u2014finding systematic problems hidden across multiple rules or regions\u2014helps catch risks that basic filtering might miss. By grouping related errors and highlighting hot spots, designers can see the big picture and focus their time where it counts. AI-based clustering algorithms reliably transform weeks of manual investigation into minutes of guided analysis.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster.</p><p>Another benefit: collaboration. By treating results as shared, living datasets\u2014rather than static tables\u2014modern tools let teams assign owners, annotate findings and pass exact analysis views between block and partition engineers, even across organizational boundaries. Dynamic bookmarks and shared UI states cut down on confusion and rework. Instead of \u201cback and forth,\u201d teams move forward together.</p><p>Many of these innovations tease at what\u2019s possible when AI is built into the heart of the verification flow. Not only do they help designers analyze the results; they help everyone reason about the data, summarize findings and make better design decisions all the way to tape out.</p><h2>A real-world breakthrough in DRC analysis and collaboration: Siemens\u2019 Calibre Vision AI</h2><p>One of the most striking examples of AI-powered DRC analysis comes from <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a>, whose <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI platform</a> is setting new standards for how full-chip verification happens. Building on years of experience in physical verification, Siemens realized that breaking bottlenecks required not only smarter algorithms but rethinking how teams work together and how data moves across the flow.</p><p>Vision AI is designed for speed and scalability. It uses a compact error database and a multi-threaded engine to load millions\u2014or even billions\u2014of errors in minutes, visualizing them so engineers see clusters and hot spots across the entire die. Instead of a wall of error codes or isolated rule violations, the tool presents a heat map of the layout, highlighting areas with the highest concentration of issues. By enabling or disabling layers (layout, markers, heat map) and adjusting layer opacity, users get a clear, customizable view of what\u2019s happening\u2014and where to look next.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. </p><p>But the real magic is in AI-guided clustering. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. This means designers can attack the root cause once, fixing problems for hundreds of checks at a time instead of tediously resolving them one by one. In cases where legacy tools would force teams to slog through, for example, 3,400 checks with 600 million errors, Vision AI\u2019s clustering can reduce that effort to investigating just 381 groups\u2014turning mountains into molehills and speeding debug time by at least 2x.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Calibre Vision software, check groups, cells list, and die-view heatmap interface screenshot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ac191\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/calibre-vision-software-check-groups-cells-list-and-die-view-heatmap-interface-screenshot.jpg?id=61784282&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 2. The Calibre Vision AI software automates and simplifies the chip-level DRC verification process.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p><span>Vision AI is also highly collaborative. Dynamic bookmarks capture the exact state of analysis, from layer filters to zoomed layout areas, along with annotations and owner assignments. Sharing a bookmark sends a living analysis\u2014not just a static snapshot\u2014to coworkers, so everyone is working from the same view. Teams can export results databases, distribute actionable groups to block owners, and seamlessly import findings into other Siemens EDA tools for further debug.</span></p><h2>Empowering every designer: reducing the expertise gap</h2><p>A frequent pain point in chip verification is the need for deep expertise\u2014knowing which errors matter, which patterns mean trouble, and how to interpret complex results. Calibre Vision AI helps level the playing field. Its AI-based algorithms consistently create the same clusters and debug paths that senior experts would identify, but does so in minutes. New users can quickly find systematic issues and perform like seasoned engineers, helping chip companies address workforce shortages and staff turnover.</p><p>Beyond clusters and bookmarks, Vision AI lets designers build custom signals by leveraging their own data. The platform secures customer models and data for exclusive use, making sure sensitive information stays within the company. And by integrating with Siemens\u2019 EDA AI ecosystem, <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> supports generative AI chatbots and reasoning assistants. Designers can ask direct questions\u2014about syntax, about a signal, about the flow\u2014and get prompt\u2014accurate answers, streamlining training and adoption.</p><h2>Real results: speeding analysis and sharing insight</h2><p>Customer feedback from leading IC companies shows the real-world value of AI for full-chip DRC analysis and debug. One company reported that Vision AI reduced their debug effort by at least half\u2014a gain that makes the difference between tapeout and delay. Another noted the platform\u2019s signals algorithm automatically creates the same check groups that experienced users would manually identify, saving not just time but energy.</p><p>Quantitative gains are dramatic. For example, Calibre Vision AI can load and visualize error files significantly faster than traditional debug flows. Figure 3 shows the difference in four different test cases: a results file that took 350 minutes with the traditional flow, took Calibre Vision AI only 31 minutes. In another test case (not shown), it took just five minutes to analyze and cluster 3.2 billion errors from more than 380 rule checks into 17 meaningful groups. Instead of getting lost in gigabytes of error data, designers now spend time solving real problems.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar graph comparing traditional flow vs. Vision AI flow times at various nanometer scales.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2f678\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/bar-graph-comparing-traditional-flow-vs-vision-ai-flow-times-at-various-nanometer-scales.jpg?id=61784294&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 3. Charting the results load time between the traditional DRC debug flow and the Calibre Vision AI flow.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><h2>Looking ahead: the future of AI in chip design</h2><p><span></span><span>Today\u2019s chips demand more than incremental improvements in EDA software. As the need for speed, quality and collaboration continues to grow, the story of physical verification will be shaped by smarter, more adaptive technologies. With AI-powered DRC analysis, we see a clear path: a faster and more productive way to find systematic issues, intelligent debug, stronger collaboration and the chance for every designer to make an expert impact.</span></p><p>By combining the creativity of engineers with the speed and insight of AI, platforms like <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> are driving a new productivity curve in full-chip analysis. With these tools, teams don\u2019t just keep up with complexity\u2014they turn it into a competitive advantage.</p><p>At Siemens, the future of chip verification is already taking shape\u2014where intelligence works hand in hand with intuition, and new ideas find their way to silicon faster than ever before. As the industry continues to push boundaries and unlock the next generation of devices, AI will help chip design reach new heights.</p><p><em>For more on Calibre Vision AI and how Siemens is shaping the future of chip design, visit <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">eda.sw.siemens.com</a> and search for Calibre Vision AI.</em></p>"

Over the course of six decades, it has advanced through\u2014by our count\u2014three phases: first connecting computers, then mobile devices, and later all devices. But </span><span>that\u2019s</span> just the start. Because just ahead comes new frontiers of connected intelligence and then, later, </span><span>perception</span><span>. Last, we suggest, </span><span>represents</span> a kind of global or ubiquitous connectedness, and finally connectedness even down to the quantum scale. </p><p><span>Through every phase, connectivity has been the unifying principle, although with every successive phase also comes new </span><em><span><em>forms</em></span></em><span> of connection. The story begins with connected packets of data across fixed networks of big machines. Then comes mobility, along with broadly connecting all </span><span>manner</span> of machines\u2014not just mobile and fixed computing devices. Having already progressed through the first three Phases of the Internet (and having now entered the fourth), the world today has seen the steady expansion of human potential, while unlocking new industries, and reshaping how everyone connected to the Internet lives and works.  </p><p><span>With a nod to </span><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56966/speech-all-the-worlds-a-stage\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>Shakespeare\u2019s </span></span><em><span><em><span>As You Like It</span></em></span></em></a><span><span>, what follows is our sketch of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases. However, unlike the Bard\u2019s \u201c7 ages of man,\u201d each of the Internet\u2019s eras do not come to an end when the next one starts. The Internet\u2019s 7 Phases, in other words, are not sequential but rather additive. Each phase builds on and extends the </span><span>previous</span><span>, in the process setting the foundation for what is still to come.</span></span> </p><h2>Phase 1: The Internet </h2><p><span>The original Internet was conceived in the 1970s to interconnect computer networks. Its groundbreaking aspect lay not only in its architecture but also in the principle of openness. By adopting </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/todays-internet-still-relies-on-an-arpanetera-protocol-the-request-for-comments\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>common protocols</span></span></a><span>, diverse networks could connect regardless of their location. The Internet has transformed isolated systems into a \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d enabling unprecedented collaboration across institutions and borders. </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/write-and-wrong\">Early applications</a> such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/computer-networking\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>email and file transfer</span></span></a> <span>demonstrated</span> that connectivity could democratize access to information. </p><p><span>In the early 1990s, the </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fathers-of-the-internet-revolution-urge-todays-pioneers-to-reinvent-the-web\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>World Wide Web</span></span></a> introduced a unifying framework: URLs as addresses, HTTP for communication, HTML as a common language, and the browser as a universal interface. Between <a href=\"https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>1991 and \u201893</span></span></a><span>, the Web transformed the Internet from a research network into a global platform for information exchange, paving the way for broader adoption. </span> </p><h2>Phase 2: The Mobile Internet </h2><p><span>The next big leap involved mobility.</span> <a href=\"https://icons8.com/blog/articles/what-was-the-internet-of-the-early-2000s/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>In the early to mid-2000s</span></span></a><span>, as mobile Internet devices spread and smartphones matured, connectivity turned portable. The Internet was no longer tethered to desktops; it traveled in pockets, purses, and messenger bags. </span> </p><p><span><span>The Internet\u2019s newfound portability connected billions of people around the world for the first time, reshaping communication, commerce, and entertainment. Social networks </span><span>flourished,</span> mobile payments reached those without access to traditional banking, and services like </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>ridesharing</span></span></a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-algorithms-that-make-instacart-roll\" target=\"_blank\">food delivery</a> became everyday conveniences. Connectivity had transformed from being deskbound and centered around one\u2019s PC to becoming an always-on, portable, digital resource network woven into daily life. The <a href=\"https://actonline.org/2021/04/07/a-brief-history-of-time-the-app-stores/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>app economy</span></span></a> soon followed, where any service or application could be accessed instantly at our fingertips. </p><h2>Phase 3: The Internet of Things (IoT) </h2><p><span>Connectivity expanded beyond PCs and mobile devices to all digital devices with any networking capability, creating today\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>Internet of Things</span></span></a><span> (IoT). Sensors, appliances, and other devices in homes, factories, cars, and cities </span><span>stream</span> telemetry data around the clock, turning the Internet into an invisible nervous system linking the physical and digital worlds. The IoT has opened new possibilities in healthcare, manufacturing, <span>logistics</span><span>, and agriculture such as connected tractors and soil sensors that enable smart farming, boosting yields while conserving resources.</span> </p><h2>Phase 4: The Internet of AI Agents  </h2><p><span>The most profound shift now underway is the rise of </span><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-economy\" target=\"_blank\">AI agents</a>.</span><span> Unlike IoT devices that merely </span><span>transmit</span> data, agents can <span>perceive, reason, act, and collaborate<strong>.</strong></span><span> They are no longer passive </span><span>endpoints</span> but rather independent actors shaping digital and physical economies. </p><p><span>Two dimensions define this phase:</span> </p><ul><li><span><strong>Digital AI agents:</strong></span><span> This category includes software-based entities such as coding copilots, digital assistants, workflow </span><span>orchestrators,</span> and trading algorithms. They live in the digital world but shape economies and <span>services</span>. Consider, for instance, a coding copilot that <span>assists</span> developers and collaborates with other agents to debug, refactor, and <span>optimize</span> software in real time. </li></ul><ul><li><span><strong>Physical AI agents:</strong></span><span> By contrast, physical AI agents are systems that </span><span>operate</span> across both digital and physical environments such as autonomous vehicles, drones, industrial robots, and medical devices. A self-driving car that fuses <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar-on-a-chip\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>lidar</span></span></a><span>, radar, and </span><span>ISAC (<a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2024/6/integrated-sensing-and-communication\" target=\"_blank\">Integrated Sensing and Communications</a>)</span><span> is one increasingly prominent type of physical AI agent today. This agent detects its environment, avoids collisions, and coordinates with nearby vehicles and traffic systems. ISAC functions here as part of the vehicle, supplying the instant-by-instant environmental awareness that allows the car to navigate without human control.</span></li></ul><p><span>We call Phase 4 not just the era of AI agents but rather the \u201cInternet of AI Agents.\u201d This is because value arises not from isolated intelligence but from </span><span>networked intelligence.</span> Agents will communicate, collaborate, and coordinate in real time across networks on Earth and in the oceans and skies and beyond, creating new forms of productivity, trust, and resilience. </p><h2>Phase 5: The Internet of Senses </h2><p><span>If Phase 4 brought intelligence through agents, the next step of Internet integration is </span><span><span>perception</span>.</span> The Internet of Senses extends connectivity from exchanging information to exchanging <span>experiences<strong>.</strong></span> </p><p><span>Two dimensions define this phase:</span> </p><ul><li><span><strong>Multisensory communication</strong></span> expands the network\u2019s palate beyond just text, audio, and video. In the age of the Internet of Senses, networks will carry signals that convey the modalities of touch, taste, and smell. Advances in haptic wearables, digital olfaction, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) will allow a shopper to \u201cfeel\u201d the texture of clothing online or \u201csmell\u201d perfume before buying. In healthcare, doctors will remotely examine patients using haptic gloves that transmit the sense of feeling. Meanwhile, education will become more immersive, enabling students to explore history or science through tactile and sensory experiences. </li></ul><ul><li><span><strong>ISAC at the network level:</strong></span> Unlike the era of AI agents, where intelligence came embedded with its own sensing and communications systems, here the <span>network is the thing doing the perceiving<strong>.</strong></span> Programmable surfaces and meta-materials will shape signals, enabling motion detection, distance measurement, and localization as part of system communications. Smart cities, for instance, will detect traffic flow and crowd movement in real time, feeding its own \u201csenses\u201d of the environment directly into its network. </li></ul><p><span>The Internet of Senses will make connectivity </span><span>immersive and context-aware,</span> enriching how humans and machines interact and laying the foundation for embodied intelligence in the physical world. </p><h2>Phase 6: The Ubiquitous Internet </h2><p><span>As billions of devices and AI agents come online, the importance of seamless coverage ramps up. Phase 6, the Ubiquitous Internet, addresses this network-level need by integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial infrastructures like cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, local area networks, fiber, satellites, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-wireless\" target=\"_blank\">high-altitude platforms</a> into one unified global network.</span> </p><p><span><span>Ultimately, a</span> Ubiquitous Internet will ensure connectivity everywhere across remote villages, open oceans, skies, orbit, cislunar space, and beyond. This wide-scale network will underpin the next advances in autonomy, </span><span>perception</span><span>, and intelligence, enabling AI agents and human users alike to </span><span>operate</span> without borders. </p><h2>Phase 7: The Quantum Internet  </h2><p><span>The final frontier in connectivity will be the Quantum Internet, where quantum communication, networking, sensing, and computing converge. Unlike the classical Internet, which transmits bits, the Quantum Internet distributes </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-quantum-entanglement\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>qubits</span></span></a><span> through entanglement and teleportation, enabling capabilities beyond anything conventional systems can achieve. Early demonstrations are already showing </span><span>the Quantum</span> Internet\u2019s potential. Entangled qubits transmitted over optical fibers and satellites will one day create ultra-secure communication channels, resistant to interception, while quantum sensors achieve <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vacuum-measurement\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented precision</a> in measuring time, motion, and the environment. These innovations will together open possibilities such as navigation without GPS and ultra-sensitive environmental monitoring.  </p><p><span><span>Greater still </span><span>is</span> the promise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-networks-cisco-quantum-computing\" target=\"_blank\">quantum networking</a>, which will interconnect distributed quantum processors into one planetary-scale connected computer system. AI systems will run across multiple quantum computers at once, working together on the same sets of problems. Expect integrated quantum AI systems, for example, to speed up the creation of new medicines and to optimize routes for complicated supply and delivery chains.</span></p><p><span>The Quantum Internet will not replace the classical Internet but augment it, overlaying quantum signals with classical bits. Just as the Internet of Agents put intelligence in motion, the Quantum Internet will supercharge that intelligence by embedding it with the laws of physics at the smallest scales: weaving together sensing, security, computation, and AI into a single global system of connectivity.</span></p><h2>Comparing the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases  </h2><p><span><span>Taken together, the 7 Phases of the Internet above tell how connectivity has expanded </span><span>from workstations and mainframes</span> to mobile devices to people and the physical world. We have drawn lessons from the first three phases to forecast several new phases ahead: involving networked integration of AI agents, senses, everything in the classical world, and finally down into the quantum realm as well. To highlight how each phase is built on the last, what follows is a side-by-side view of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases:</span></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-cards\"><noscript><img alt=\"cards visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25618132/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p><span>As the above illustrates, the Internet\u2019s evolution has been both </span><span>vertical and horizontal.</span><span> Vertically, each phase has added new layers of capability from hosts to people to devices to agents, building on the shared foundation of connectivity. Horizontally, new paradigms have often run </span><span>in parallel</span><span> with existing ones: fixed and mobile networks </span><span>coexisted,</span><span> IoT expanded alongside human communication. And in the future, quantum channels will share the same fiber as classical signals on different wavelengths.</span></p><p><span>The combination of layering and parallel expansion has made the Internet resilient, scalable, and continuously transformative. Meanwhile, at every stage, connectivity has adapted to new demands\u2014enabling the Internet to be not just a network of endpoints but a<strong> </strong></span><span>fabric of fabrics,</span> supporting diversity while fostering integration. </p><p><span><span>Each phase of the Internet\u2014from networks to people to things to agents to senses to ubiquity to the quantum world\u2014has extended and will continue to extend the foundation of connectivity. Each of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases overcomes the limits of the </span><span>previous</span> phase, while also opening new frontiers. </span> </p><p><span><span>Even as the Internet </span><span>enters into</span> Phase 4, long gone is its limited mandate of merely moving data packets. The Internet is today and over its future phases becoming the intelligent, resilient, and universal fabric upon which the world\u2019s digital future rests. And in the age of AI, connectivity is not merely the foundation. It is increasingly </span><span>intelligence itself.</span></p>"

This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn\u2019t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as </span><a href=\"https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/why-is-everyones-robot-folding-clothes\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a><span> so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything\u2014but that isn\u2019t true, and we\u2019re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.</span></p><p><span>With that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are <strong>my</strong> Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update <a href=\"https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games\" target=\"_blank\">my Substack</a> as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.</span></p><h2>Current State of The Art</h2><p>In order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let\u2019s first talk about what\u2019s working now. What I\u2019m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).</p><p>Thinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.</p><ol><li><strong>No force feedback at the wrists.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note2\">2</a></sup> The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don\u2019t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.</li><li><strong>Limited finger control.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note3\">3</a></sup> It\u2019s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot\u2019s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.</li><li><strong>No sense of touch.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note4\">4</a></sup> Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that\u2019s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.</li><li><strong>Medium precision.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note5\">5</a></sup> Based on videos I\u2019ve seen, I think we\u2019ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.</li></ol><p><span>Now, on to the events!</span></p><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event1\">Event 1: Doors</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event1\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event2\">Event 2: Laundry</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event2\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event3\">Event 3: Tools</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event3\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event4\">Event 4: Fingertip Manipulation</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event4\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event5\">Event 5: Wet Manipulation</a></h4><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"event1\">Event 1: Doors</h2><p>Things like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp.

It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"event3\">Event 3: Tools</h2><p>Humans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools.

Continuous 4K video capture would, in fact, quickly swamp SKATE\u2019s data storage, as a single day of 4K recording would require 100 times as much memory as SKATE has.</p><p>\u201cThe real challenge wasn\u2019t plugging in cameras and sensors,\u201d says <a href=\"https://dewesoft.com/blog/alessia-longo\" target=\"_blank\">Alessia Longo</a>, an engineer at Dewesoft. \u201cIt was forcing them to write into a single, perfectly synchronized file, and taming the data flood.\u201d</p><p><span>That data is stored on two SSDs with a total capacity of up to 6 terabytes, and the system operates autonomously for a full day in good weather, relying on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/solar-panels-micro-cpv\" target=\"_blank\">solar panels</a> and replaceable batteries.</span></p><p><span></span>\u201cThe creativity of a volcanologist lies in the ability to take technologies developed for other industries, like high-speed cameras used in sports events or military thermal imagers, and adapt them for scientific research on active volcanoes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/ingv.it/scarlato/home\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Piergiorgio Scarlato</span></a>, INGV\u2019s research director.</p><h2>Modular Design Enhances Volcanic Monitoring</h2><p>Placed between 300 and 900 meters from Stromboli\u2019s active vents, SKATE runs almost entirely on its own. Researchers only hike up once a day to swap batteries and memory cards. </p><p>The design is also modular. Alongside the thermal, high-speed, and acoustic sensors, INGV is now testing SKATE with a UV camera to quantify <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/stories/so2-volcanoes\" target=\"_blank\"><span>sulfur dioxide</span></a> emissions. It\u2019s also testing a laser rangefinder that provides distances to volcano\u2019s plume or crater rim, or moving slopes ten times per second. It can also provide analysis of individual lava bombs and rock fragments ejected during eruptions, allowing for precise reconstructions of their trajectories and landing areas.</p><p>\u201cDepth is what turns a spectacular image into a measurement,\u201d says Scarlato \u201cBy understanding how volcanic projectiles are launched, how far they travel, and where they fall, we can better assess the impact of eruptions on people, infrastructure, and the surrounding environment.\u201d</p><p>On Stromboli, the INGV team has analyzed more than a thousand explosions recorded between 2019 and 2024, matching high-speed videos, temperatures, and sound. Each vent, they discovered, develops its own personality: gas-rich jets sound softer and linger longer, while volcanic bombs\u2014chunks of lava flung out during an eruption\u2014and ash-rich blasts roar briefly and hurl incandescent fragments higher into the air.</p><h2>SKATE\u2019s Role in Volcanic Data Analysis</h2><p>SKATE isn\u2019t a 24/7 alarm. It\u2019s too complex and data-hungry to stream from a crater rim in real time. Instead, it helps fixed monitoring networks located farther from the crater\u2014such as thermal cameras, infrasound arrays, and other instruments\u2014to make better sense of their signals.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A helmeted researcher writing notes on a mountainside.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"555a2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-helmeted-researcher-writing-notes-on-a-mountainside.jpg?id=62005118&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A researcher uses SKATE to monitor a volcano.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci</small></p><p>Data from SKATE is helping scientists <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-20900-2\" target=\"_blank\"><span>test hypotheses </span></a>about how gas bubbles rise and burst inside magma, how volcanic conduits are shaped, and study subsurface processes that ordinary monitoring can\u2019t see. INGV aims to turn some recurring patterns into reference libraries that could train automated systems to recognize early warning signs in live data streams.</p><p>SKATE\u2019s success is changing how volcanologists monitor active volcanoes for warning signs. But volcanoes will never be truly predictable or safe environments. Humidity often corrodes cables and steams camera lenses. During one recent deployment, a goat ate the microphone cable. And in a recent research campaign on Stromboli, INGV experimented with a new black and white high-speed sensor, ideal for tracking glowing bombs at night proved trickier than expected, as Stromboli\u2019s bursts last only a few seconds and make it difficult for the sensor to focus on them.</p><p>Despite the hurdles, the rapid, detailed data SKATE provides is welcome. \u201cWorking in such extreme conditions, with humidity, gases, and sudden temperature changes, is the real test for any technology,\u201d says Scarlato. \u201cThe difference now is that our interventions last minutes, not hours.\u201d</p>"

But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.</p><h2>Eavor\u2019s Geothermal Breakthrough in Germany </h2><p>Eavor began drilling in Geretsried in July <span>2023</span>, shortly after winning a <a href=\"https://eavor.com/press-releases/eavors-next-generation-geothermal-project-awarded-916-million-grant-from-the-european-innovation-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">$<span>107</span> million grant</a> from the European Union\u2019s Innovation Fund. For its first <span>\u201c</span>loop,\u201d the company drilled two vertical wells reaching nearly <span>2</span>.<span>8</span> miles below the surface, then created a dozen horizontal wells\u2014like tines of a fork\u2014that each stretch <span>1</span>.<span>8</span> miles long. Once in place, the wells are connected underground and sealed off so that they operate like radiators: As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the rocks and brings it to the surface.</p><p>Operations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans to begin construction on its second loop in March <span>2026</span>. All told, the system will supply <span>8</span>.<span>2</span> megawatts of electricity to the regional grid and <span>64</span> <span>MW</span> of district heating to nearby towns, operating flexibly to provide more heat during chilly winter months and produce more electricity in summer. </p><p><span>In its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over </span><span>100</span><span> days to complete\u2014a major expense in an industry where drilling rigs can cost about $</span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span>000</span><span> a day to run. But the company said it improved its techniques and adapted its equipment in ways that reduced the drilling time for the remaining four wells by </span><span>50 percent</span><span>.</span></p><p>For example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.</p><p>On top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor\u2019s thermal-energy output per loop by about <span>35 percent</span>, Vany said.</p><p>The Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/geothermal-energy\" target=\"_blank\">other next-generation approaches</a>\u2014like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/fervo-energy-breaks-ground-on-next-generation-geothermal-plant\" target=\"_blank\">building in Utah</a> and <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/americas-first-enhanced-geothermal-plant-just-got-up-and-running\" target=\"_blank\">operating in Nevada</a>\u2014are also scaling up.</p><h2>Challenges in Geothermal Drilling</h2><p>Enhanced geothermal involves <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/geothermal-energy\" target=\"_blank\">fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids</a> to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater\u2014though experts say that\u2019s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.</p><p>But the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said <a href=\"https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/jefferson-w-tester/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Tester,</a> a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell\u2019s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>While companies developing closed-loop systems can make them work, the main challenge they face is for fluid temperatures and flow rates to be high enough to pay off economically,\u201d Tester said. <span>\u201c</span>You can get energy out of the ground; it\u2019s just, how much can you sustainably and affordably produce from a single closed-loop well connection?\u201d</p><p>Vany said that Eavor\u2019s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the <span>\u201c</span>levelized cost of heat\u201d in Europe, which estimates the average cost of providing a unit of heat over the lifetime of the project. That figure can fluctuate between $<span>50</span> and $<span>100</span> per megawatt-hour thermal in the region\u2019s volatile energy market, she said.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>After we\u2019ve drilled those first four loops, we will be at the bottom of the learning curve,\u201d Vany added. <span>\u201c</span>And that\u2019s the purpose of the Geretsried project.\u201d<br /></p>"

Moore explained to me between bites of a cold tongue sandwich at the 2nd Ave Deli, near <em><em>IEEE</em></em> <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s office, better thermal management is essential for next-generation nodes.</p><p>\u201cAs we start doing more 3D chips, the heat problem gets much worse,\u201d said Moore, who has been covering semiconductors on and off for a quarter century.</p><p>For the special report in this issue, Moore teamed up with Associate Editor Dina Genkina, who oversees our computing coverage. They talked to engineers at IEEE conferences like <a href=\"https://www.ieee-iedm.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEDM</a> and <a href=\"https://supercomputing.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Supercomputing</a> about how technologists are getting the heat out in new and surprising ways.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cAs we start doing more 3D chips, the heat problem gets much worse.\u201d <strong>\u2014Samuel K. Moore</strong></span></p><p>The first step to solving an engineering problem is characterizing it precisely. In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_blank\">Will Heat Cause a Moore\u2019s Law Meltdown?</a>\u201d, James Myers, of Imec in Cambridge, England, describes how transistors entering commercial production in the 2030s will have a power density that raises temperatures by 9 \u00b0C. In data centers where hot chips are crammed together by the millions, this increase could force hardware to shut down or risk permanent damage.</p><p>In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">Next-Gen AI Needs Liquid Cooling</a>\u201d, Genkina takes readers on a deep dive into four contenders to beat this heat with liquids: cold plates with a circulating water-glycol mixture attached directly to the hottest chips; a version of that tech in which a specialized dielectric fluid boils into vapor; dunking entire servers in tanks filled with dielectric oil; and doing the same in tanks of boiling dielectric fluid.</p><p>Although liquid cooling works well, \u201cit\u2019s also more expensive and introduces additional points of failure,\u201d Moore cautioned. \u201cBut when you\u2019re consuming kilowatts and kilowatts in such a small space, you do what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>As mind-blowing as servers in boiling oil may seem, the two other articles in this issue focus on even more radical cooling technologies. One involves using lasers to cool chips. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/laser-cooling-chips\" target=\"_blank\">The technique, outlined by Jacob Balma and Alejandro Rodriguez from the Minnesota-based startup Maxwell Labs</a>, involves converting phonons (vibrations in a crystal lattice that carry heat) into photons that can be piped away. The authors contend that their technique \u201ccan target hot spots as they form, with laser precision.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Stanford\u2019s Srabanti Chowdhury takes a blanket approach to the heat problem, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/diamond-thermal-conductivity\" target=\"_blank\">swaddling transistors in a polycrystalline diamond film</a>. Her team\u2019s technology has progressed remarkably fast, reducing diamond-film growth temperatures from 1,000 \u00b0C to less than 400 \u00b0C, making it compatible with standard CMOS manufacturing.</p>None of these solutions comes cheap, and so the future of chips is going to be expensive as well as hot. That probably doesn\u2019t faze the big AI companies sitting on giant piles of investors\u2019 cash. As Moore pointed out as he polished off a pickle, \u201cAI\u2019s demand for chips is sort of unlimited, so you\u2019ve got to do things that you wouldn\u2019t have thought of doing before and swallow the expense.<strong>\u201d </strong>"

The two-door convertible on display had no engine, gears, or gadgets, but its exterior, likely made of plaster and fiberglass, resembled a rocket ship, which was the intention of designer Joe Oros.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of an exceptionally clean automobile engine.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f8012\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-an-exceptionally-clean-automobile-engine.jpg?id=61951875&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100\u2019s V-8 engine featured a three-speed automatic transmission.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>Over the next year and a half, Ford engineers, led by Hiram Pacific, spent at least US $2 million (about $24 million today) turning the display model into a fully functional car. Paul Adams was chief electrical engineer and in charge of most of the gadgets; Paul Wagner was the electrical engineer tasked with making the electrical system work. By the time they were done, the car contained 302 kilograms of electrical equipment, including a 12-volt ignition system, an extra-large generator, 24 electrical motors, 44 vacuum tubes, 50 lightbulbs, 92 control switches, 29 solenoids, 53 relays, 23 circuit breakers, and 10 fuses, all connected by 16 kilometers of wiring. That\u2019s a lot of electronics, but then again, a lot of gizmos were jammed into the car. Touted as a \u201claboratory on wheels,\u201d the futuristic auto included more than 50 innovations.</p><p>One of the most visible features was the clear, nonglare, heatproof plastic sliding roof panel. At the flick of a lever, the windows rolled down and the top retracted. When an electrical moisture sensor detected a hint of rain, it would automatically seal the car. Alas, the X-100 did not have air conditioning. I\u2019m a South Carolinian, and the thought of an uncooled drive on a sunny, hot August day is, let\u2019s say, unappealing. I suspect the designers, being in Detroit, hadn\u2019t thought through summer in the Deep South.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large 1950s convertible on a curved race track.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d726\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-1950s-convertible-on-a-curved-race-track.jpg?id=61951902&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In this 1953 photo, the Ford X-100\u2019s roof panel is retracted and the windows are down. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>The designers did consider certain types of weather because the windshield wipers could spray hot or cold fluid depending on the outside temperature, and the rear window had a defroster. Another feature that I\u2019m sure wowed people in colder climates were the car\u2019s heated leather seats. The front seats were also electrically adjustable in six positions, with presets for two different drivers.</p><p>The car had a 10-tube, signal-seeking radio with separate controls and speakers for front and rear passengers. The radio itself was tucked out of sight below the dashboard, but a prismatic mirror could be lowered to show the dial.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Retro car dashboard with labeled phone, electric shaver, and steering wheel features.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a65aa\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/retro-car-dashboard-with-labeled-phone-electric-shaver-and-steering-wheel-features.jpg?id=61951890&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100 had a radiophone [top], built-in electric shaver [middle], and multifunction steering wheel with a clock and variable-volume horn [bottom].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>Bluetooth pairing obviously wasn\u2019t available in 1953, but the Ford X-100 did have a radiophone mounted in the center console, through which you could place calls via the Bell System\u2019s Mobile Telephone Service. It also had a dictaphone to record all those great ideas you\u2019d have while driving around with the wind in your hair. One innovation that didn\u2019t stand the test of time was the electric shaver and pop-up mirror stowed away in the glove compartment.</p><p>Each wheel had a built-in hydraulic jack attached to the chassis to easily lift the car when you had to change a tire. (Tubeless tires weren\u2019t yet commonplace, so changing flats was something every driver had to do.) A clock was mounted in the center of the steering wheel, where you\u2019d expect the horn to be. The horn, meanwhile, could be activated by a thin circle surrounding the clock or from buttons on the arms of the steering wheel. It had two different volume settings, softer for city traffic and louder for country roads.</p><p>The transmission had an electrically operated gear selector, which most cars didn\u2019t have at the time. In addition to power steering, there was power braking that included an electric power-assisted hand brake. Electric switches on the instrument panel opened, closed, locked, and unlocked the hood and trunk. Unfortunately, though, there were no mechanical releases to open the hood and trunk if the car lost power.</p><p>The X-100 had a built-in battery charger that could be plugged into an electrical outlet to allow the various gizmos to work even if the car wasn\u2019t running. But not every feature was electrical: Housed in a black leather pouch in front of the center console was a brass pump-style fire extinguisher. Just in case of emergency.</p><h2>The Ford X-100 Was Big in Paris</h2><p>The concept car had its second debut in the summer of 1953 during Ford\u2019s 50th-anniversary celebrations. The anniversary presented a golden opportunity for Henry Ford II to redefine the company, as Douglas Brinkley writes in <a href=\"https://douglasbrinkley.com/books/wheels-for-the-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Wheels for the World</em></em></a><em><em>, </em></em>a sweeping history of Ford published by Penguin in 2003 to celebrate the company\u2019s centennial. For its 50th, Ford produced the film <a href=\"https://www.filmpreservation.org/sponsored-films/screening-room/the-american-road-1953\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The American Road</em></em></a>; an illustrated company history, <em><em>Ford at Fifty: An American Story</em></em>;<em> </em>a two-hour <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281441/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">television special</a> hosted by Edward R. Murrow and featuring Ethel Merman, Mary Martin, and Bing Crosby; and a calendar illustrated by Norman Rockwell.</p><p>As part of this celebration, the Ford X-100 made the European circuit of auto shows. It racked up nearly 10,000 km crisscrossing the continent, driving from Paris to London to Bonn to Cologne and averaging 12 miles per gallon (about 5 km per liter) of gasoline. Despite its gas gauge indicator lights, the X-100 ran out of gas in the middle of the night on its final trip to the French port of Le Havre.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large 1950s car on a circular stage surrounded by a crowd of onlookers.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9b190\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-1950s-car-on-a-circular-stage-surrounded-by-a-crowd-of-onlookers.jpg?id=61951835&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100, shown here in Paris, racked up nearly 30,000 kilometers driving to auto shows, fairs, and dealerships. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</small></p><p>The car also toured the United States, stopping at fairs and dealerships and adding another 12,000 miles (19,300 km) to the odometer. A Ford engineer always accompanied the car to demonstrate the various features and answer any questions.</p><p>The X-100 wasn\u2019t exactly the star of <em><em>Woman\u2019s World, </em></em>but the movie industry estimated that 80 million people saw its features demonstrated on screen<em><em>.</em></em> Four other Ford concept cars also appeared, including the XL-500, the XM-800, and the Ventura, as did a Detroit auto plant.</p><p>Between the movie and the auto shows, Ford estimated that more people saw the X-100 than any other concept car. The company eventually donated the X-100 to <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Henry Ford museum</a>, in Dearborn, Mich., where it went into storage. In 1987, the X-100 went back on public display as part of the <em><em>Automobile in American Life </em></em>exhibit. Although the car isn\u2019t currently on exhibit, it still turns up occasionally at auto shows.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-concept-cars\" target=\"_blank\">Concept-Car Tech Makes Wheels Wise to Well-being</a></p><p>The purpose of a concept car is to excite the public with dreams of a possible future. The Ford X-100 did more than that: It not only embodied aspiration and hope, it actually delivered on many of its promises. Car-connected phones, heated seats, and electric windows may seem commonplace now, but they first had to be imagined. With the exception of that electric shaver, kudos to the Ford engineers of the 1950s for making those dreams a reality.</p><p><em>Part of a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\">continuing series</a> looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></p><p><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the November 2025 print issue as \u201cFord and the Road Mostly Taken.\u201d</em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>I love when I get to watch old movies as part of my research, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBbbgttdqBQ\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Woman\u2019s World</em></a> was fun.
