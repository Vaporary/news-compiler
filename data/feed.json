        "summary": "T\u00fcrkiye's response to post-pandemic inflation is a cautionary tale of how political pressure for low interest rates can create macroeconomic instabilities. While central banks worldwide raised interest rates to combat inflation in 2021-2023, Turkish authorities pursued the opposite strategy: cutting real rates to deeply negative levels while implementing financial engineering tools, FX interventions, and financial repression to stabilize markets. The centerpiece was a novel FX-protected deposit scheme (KKM) that guaranteed depositors against currency depreciation, shifting exchange rate risk to the government balance sheet. We provide a detailed account of this policy experiment and develop a theoretical model focusing on how KKM functions and creates vulnerabilities. Our model reveals that pressure to keep interest rates below inflation-targeting levels can lead to an interconnected destabilizing sequence. Low rates generate inflation, current account deficits, and exchange rate depreciation. KKM provides partial stabilization by effectively raising rates for savers while maintaining low rates for borrowers. However, this creates growing contingent fiscal burdens and vulnerability to self-fulfilling currency and sovereign debt crises. This explains additional policies adopted including capital flow management, financial repression, and return to orthodox monetary policy. As central banks worldwide face renewed pressure to set lower policy rates, T\u00fcrkiye's experience illustrates the consequences."

These expectations shape key decisions but are formed under deep uncertainty. We use a 2019 state-contingent survey of 11,000 Danish women linked to administrative data to compare pre-birth beliefs to realized outcomes. Mothers accurately anticipate their eventual return to work but underestimate the duration of the career interruption. This miscalibration stems from two belief errors\u2014about partner leave and own labor supply\u2014which interact and persist even among second-time mothers, with implications for labor supply, planning, and policy design."

In a quantitative model calibrated to the US economy featuring both cross-state migration and risk-free savings, we find that the constrained-efficient allocation features lower population but higher average consumption in less productive states than the status quo, achieving efficiency and spatial redistribution simultaneously through dynamic incentives. In response to local negative productivity shocks, the constrained-efficient allocation features more front-loaded consumption than the status quo, with systematic heterogeneity linked to the location\u2019s pre-shock fundamentals."

Based on a database of over 150 million resumes, this metric exploits the variation in how long it takes workers to attain job titles. A person\u2019s seniority is defined as the number of years it takes the median individual\u2014within the same industry and firm size category\u2014to achieve that person\u2019s job title. Seniority aligns with standard markers of success\u2014it is positively correlated with both wages and educational attainment. To demonstrate its value as a measure of career progression, we show that individuals with higher seniority levels in the public sector are more likely to transition to higher-paying positions in the private sector. When non-monetary factors influence career choice, evaluating labor market outcomes using non-wage measures, such as seniority, offers significant advantages."

Using individual-level administrative data from the universe of civil domestic violence cases in Puerto Rico during the period 2014-2020, we leverage the staggered opening of SDVCs across judicial regions to examine the consequences for victims\u2019 judicial protection and offender recidivism. Access to SDVCs leads to a considerable 8 percentage points increase in the probability that judges issue a protection order and a 1.7 percentage point (15 percent) decrease in victim and offender reappearance rates within one year of the start of the case. Effects are more pronounced for cases in which parties have children in common and in which access to SDVCs is more limited. Linking the case data to administrative and survey data on judges, we show that the priorities of judges assigned to SDVCs play a prominent role in explaining these outcomes."

We first present the main cognitive mechanisms involved within a simple unifying framework. We then survey the extensive laboratory, online, and field experimental literature on the nature and behavioral implications of self-image concerns. We discuss in particular how they give rise to information and decision avoidance, motivated memory and beliefs, excuse-driven behavior, preferences for truth-telling, hypothetical bias, moral cleansing and moral licensing, collective identities, political preferences, and other forms of self-signaling or self-deception. We subsequently discuss common empirical strategies used to identify self-image concerns, as well as the threats to their validity and how to alleviate them. We conclude by outlining open questions and directions for future research on the belief-based approach to identity."

Using millions of job applications on an online job platform and the staggered extension of maternity leave across Chinese provinces, we find that an average increase (22%) in the length of paid maternity leave led to a 3.7 percentage point decrease in positive callbacks to female applicants relative to their male counterparts. In response, female job seekers submitted 4.4 more job applications, shifted toward jobs with 5.4% lower wages, and experienced 0.9 weeks longer job search duration than male applicants. We also find that government subsidies that partially cover firms' wage costs of extended maternity leave help alleviate its adverse impact on gender disparities in hiring."

Orbital collision warnings can be unremitting.

And nearly all of this junk, traveling at least <a href=\"https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/track/leopars.htm\" target=\"_blank\">eight times as fast</a> as a <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/how-fast-is-a-bullet\" target=\"_blank\">rifle bullet</a>, can be damaging in a collision.

Looming on the horizon, too, is the threat of orbital junk overwhelming satellites\u2019 ability to dodge disaster. Each collision then creates more fragments, in a runaway cascade that turns low Earth orbit into a hazard zone.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>For satellite operators, sudden silences could be the first warning signs. Ground station crews that today coordinate elegant sequences of thruster burns will face more chaotic obstacle courses and bigger debris fields blooming across their display monitors. Communication lines and data traffic may drop from time to time, too, sowing chaos on the ground and menacing flights across the globe. And as the slow catastrophe builds, fuel reserves for satellite constellations will bleed down into the red from so many extensive orbital maneuvers. Spacecraft that\u2019ve run dry today will be the seedbed for tumbling, hypervelocity shrapnel tomorrow.</p><p>This doomsday scenario is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Kessler syndrome,</a> named after the American astrophysicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Kessler</a>, who <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19990041784/downloads/19990041784.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in 1976</a> began circulating his first notices at NASA about possible runaway orbital debris. Now, as the magnitude of the <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-space-junk-and-why-is-it-a-problem.html\" target=\"_blank\">space junk problem</a> rapidly scales up, technological responses are ramping up as well. Solutions in the offing include high-resolution orbital tracking, AI-powered constellation management, and an emerging robotic tech called \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/european-space-agency-esa-mission-news-orbital-debris-solar-storms\" target=\"_blank\">active debris removal</a>.\u201d This last item involves lofting a specialized spacecraft into orbit, armed with grippers or other satellite-wrangling tech that can target and grab orbiting stuff. The removal craft then guides the space junk through reentry and the ultimate splashdown of whatever survives reentry into the middle of the ocean.</p><p>But tech alone may not be enough for the magnitude of the task ahead. The debris problem could simply be growing too fast. International treaties and government regulations may be needed to classify orbits as <a href=\"https://www.wfw.com/articles/spectrum-rights-and-orbital-positions-what-do-space-operators-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">globally managed resources, like radio spectrum</a>. Because as Kessler himself has pointed out, space <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/027311779190543S\" target=\"_blank\">is complicated</a>\u2014sometimes <a href=\"https://newspaceeconomy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-kessler-syndrome-2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">frustratingly so</a>.</p><h2>What Is the Kessler Syndrome?</h2><p>In the early days, those frustrations were related to simply getting the space community to realize the problem that lay ahead. Back in the early 1970s, when <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vleo\" target=\"_blank\">low Earth orbit</a> was all but pristine, Kessler was a midcareer NASA scientist, having already notched important contributions to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab\" target=\"_blank\">Skylab</a> programs. As his colleague, the late NASA administrator <a href=\"https://aquarid.physics.uwo.ca/kessler/Burt%20Cour_Palais.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Burton Cour-Palais</a>, noted in a 2004 <a href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/Cour-PalaisBG/Cour-PalaisBG_3-1-04.htm\" target=\"_blank\">oral history</a>, Kessler \u201cwas bringing up this orbital debris thing, and the higher-ups did not want to know about it at all.\u201d</p><p>Cour-Palais also recalled being told to urge Kessler to \u201ccome up with solutions rather than problems.\u201d Fortunately, neither took the overly cautious route.</p><p>In June 1978, the <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21562202\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em></em></a><em> </em>published a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JA083iA06p02637\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> by Kessler and Cour-Palais in which they argued that a rapidly growing belt of defunct satellites, collision fragments, and other detritus could \u201cbe a significant problem during the next century.\u201d It\u2019s a prediction that has come to pass. In April of this year, Kessler and <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wzjd6/professor-hugh-lewis\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Lewis</a>, professor of astronautics at the <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Birmingham</a>, in England, presented their <a href=\"https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/sdc9/paper/305/SDC9-paper305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">latest models</a>, concluding that space junk orbiting between 400 and 1,000 kilometers\u2014where most low Earth satellites operate\u2014is already unstable. And between 520 and 1,000 km, the researchers found, debris concentrations are at or near levels that might sustain runaway growth.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25069014/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p>A recent internal report shared with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em><em>, </em></em>written by analysts at the Menlo Park, Calif.\u2013based <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, has divided the problem into what it calls \u201cfour waves of the Kessler syndrome.\u201d The first three waves, it says, may have already begun. They are: nontrackable stuff like tiny steel fragments and glass splinters colliding with non-operational trackable objects; nontrackable stuff impacting functioning satellites and causing malfunctions; and trackable objects hitting other trackable objects and creating a clouds of fragments. The fourth wave, in which two large pieces of debris incite a chain reaction of other collisions, has yet to occur. In LeoLabs\u2019 observations and models, satellites and operational spacecraft including the International Space Station, and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_space_station\" target=\"_blank\">Tiangong</a> space station continue to face manageable levels of collision avoidance maneuvers\u2014for now.</p><p>\u201cIt is assumed these operational satellites will avoid catastrophic collisions with trackable objects,\u201d the report concludes.</p><p>But according to <a href=\"https://www.swfsummit.org/luc-piguet\" target=\"_blank\">Luc Piguet</a>, CEO and cofounder of the Lausanne, Switzerland\u2013based startup <a href=\"https://clearspace.today/\" target=\"_blank\">ClearSpace</a>, challenges for operational satellites are real and mounting. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is a slow, crawling effect\u2014that when it starts accelerating, it\u2019s already too late,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is happening.\u201d</p><p>The problem can be further segmented into specific problematic orbits, according to <a href=\"https://aiaa.org/people/darren-mcknight/\" target=\"_blank\">Darren McKnight</a>, senior technical fellow at <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, which performs high-resolution debris tracking for private clients and government agencies.</p><p>\u201cThere are certain altitudes where we\u2019ve already passed the threshold for the Kessler syndrome,\u201d McKnight says. For instance, at 775 km altitude, as well as at 840 km and 975 km, the collision risk is scaling up rapidly. (See graph, \u201cLow Earth Orbit\u2019s Most High-Risk Places.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cWe will hit a point where particular popular orbits are so risky to operate in that the benefits of operating there are outweighed by the cost and risk,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.daniellerwood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danielle Wood</a>, head of <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Media Lab</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-enabled/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Space Enabled Research Group</a>.</p><h2>Why Is the Kessler Syndrome Complicated?</h2><p><a href=\"https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">According to the European Space Agency</a>, 14.5 million kilograms of man-made stuff circles the planet today. Compare that to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230930201159/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">11 million</a> kg two years ago and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200818221915/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">8.9 million</a> kg in 2020\u2014a 63 percent increase over the past five years.</p><p>McKnight says the Kessler problem comes into sharper focus when dividing mass in any given orbit by the volume of space that orbit occupies. The <em><em>mass density </em></em>in orbit, also known as the mass per cubic kilometer, provides a clue not only to the chance of orbital collisions but also to those collisions\u2019 consequences. Two small orbiting items colliding won\u2019t create nearly as much new debris as will two big ones. The more densely packed an orbit is, in other words, the more treacherous it is to keep a satellite at that orbit. \u201cMass per cubic kilometer is debris-generating potential,\u201d McKnight says, which would be a great thing to know with confidence in all the different regions of low Earth orbit.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Solar panel with three impact holes and visible damage on each section.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ff39b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/solar-panel-with-three-impact-holes-and-visible-damage-on-each-section.png?id=61618553&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 2002, Space Shuttle astronauts retrieved these solar panels from the Hubble Space Telescope\u2014revealing how destructive even small projectiles are when traveling at low Earth orbit speeds.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ESA </small></p><p>However, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kcourtneybis/\" target=\"_blank\">Katherine Courtney</a>, chair of the <a href=\"https://gnosisnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Network on Sustainability in Space</a>, knowing where all orbiting stuff is today has become a tall order. \u201cA substantial portion of smaller space junk can only be extrapolated using data collected from returned spacecraft and historical records. The vast majority can\u2019t be tracked from the ground,\u201d Courtney adds.</p><p>Moreover, says <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/jonathan-mcdowell\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan McDowell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mcdowell-19b0997/\" target=\"_blank\">astrophysicist and space historian</a> at the Harvard & Smithsonian <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Astrophysics</a>, in Cambridge, Mass., once stuff in orbit goes missing, further complications emerge. Collisions between the missing matter and other debris can completely knock the collisions\u2019 by-products into different orbits.</p><p>\u201cThe operating satellites are in nice circular orbits,\u201d McDowell says, \u201cwhereas the collision debris is crossing many orbits and affecting many more.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s now needed as the problem grows larger is a complete rethink, says <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/jah\" target=\"_blank\">Moriba Jah</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics</a> at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to the Kessler syndrome,\u201d Jah says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cascading collisions can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s that the framework oversimplifies the problem and doesn\u2019t give us a way to manage or evolve the system.\u201d</p><p>Consider instead, Jah says, a parameter he calls \u201corbital carrying capacity.\u201d \u201cIf we start from the end, we can say that carrying capacity is consumed when our ability to make decisions to avert harm no longer work,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo to me, that doesn\u2019t necessarily look like you\u2019re bumping into stuff. It also looks like you\u2019re spending fuel moving around stuff so much that you can\u2019t do the things that you wanted to do to begin with.\u201d</p><h2>How to Avoid Satellite Collisions</h2><p>As SpaceX proved 144,404 times from December 2024 through May of this year, the Starlink constellation\u2019s capacity to maneuver its hardware around space junk is impressive.</p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink</a> is a brilliant constellation,\u201d McKnight says. \u201cThey\u2019re like a granny driving on the highway. They pump their brakes. They avoid everything.\u201d</p><p>However, Starlink\u2019s own public record also showcases how rapidly the collision hazards in orbit are evolving. The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://universemagazine.com/en/starlink-satellites-performed-26-thousand-avoidance-maneuvers/\" target=\"_blank\">publicly disclosed data</a> reveals a 22-fold increase since 2020 in the amount of ducking and dodging the constellation has needed to perform to avoid collisions with other stuff in orbit.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s ducking and dodging these days, too.</p><p>\u201cCollision avoidance is a standard practice now for every operator,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Flohrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Flohrer</a>, head of the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris\" target=\"_blank\">Space Debris Office</a>.</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep your operations making sense, communicating with everybody else,\u201d says <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/person/marlon-sorge\" target=\"_blank\">Marlon Sorge</a>, technical fellow at the Chantilly, Va.\u2013based <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace Corp.</a>, \u201cand not making more of the stuff that you can\u2019t communicate with.\u201d</p><p>Yet, space junk isn\u2019t the only class of noncommunicative stuff up there. \u201cMore than half of the unidentified objects are Chinese satellites,\u201d says Courtney of the Global Network on Sustainability in Space. \u201cSo they\u2019re active satellites, but they\u2019re just not registered as identifiable objects.\u201d</p><p>The tracked debris, the untrackable tiny debris, the bigger things that are also incommunicado\u2014all of it combines to make for an increasingly massive headache.</p><p>\u201cEvery collision-avoidance maneuver is a nuisance,\u201d Holger Krag, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-krag-72895324/\" target=\"_blank\">head of ESA\u2019s Space Safety office</a>, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/AI-autonomous-space-debris-avoidance-esa\" target=\"_blank\">has said.</a> \u201cNot only because of fuel consumption but also because of the preparation that goes into it. We have to book ground-station passes, which costs money. Sometimes we even have to switch off the acquisition of scientific data. We have to have an expert team available round the clock.\u201d</p><p>So who or what, then, could possibly keep up with the rapidly scaling nature of the Kessler problem? Artificial intelligence is the almost unanimous answer.</p><p>Many of the world\u2019s major players in low Earth orbit, including <a href=\"https://content.neuraspace.com/product-launch\" target=\"_blank\">small satellite startups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation/Artificial_intelligence_in_space\" target=\"_blank\">big national space programs</a>, are currently testing and developing AI constellation-management systems. Machine-learning algorithms are proving increasingly adept at making <a href=\"https://www.satnow.com/community/how-is-artificial-intelligence-ai-used-to-support-space-traffic-management\" target=\"_blank\">more accurate collision warnings and performing automated decision-making</a>\u2014as well as <a href=\"https://aicompetence.org/ai-in-space-debris-management/\" target=\"_blank\">sharpening the resolution of small object detection</a> to find smaller orbiting stuff than what non-AI-powered tracking tech can see.

You have the same amount of real estate, but you can put more objects in there more safely when you have better visibility and situational awareness of where everything is. It\u2019s the same in space.\u201d</p><h2>What Are the Solutions to the Kessler Problem?</h2><p>Space tech and space tech alone may one day resolve the Kessler syndrome.</p><p>But as a complement to the technological innovation, international space agreements and law are also being reconsidered, because much of the existing space law standards were agreed on decades ago, during an entirely different era in low Earth orbit.</p><p>For instance, between the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty\" target=\"_blank\">Outer Space Treaty of 1967</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Liability_Convention\" target=\"_blank\">1972 Space Liability Convention,</a> even an untraceable fragment of metal in space is effectively owned by the nation that launched it. This arguably means that that nation may need to give permission for anyone else to remove the fragment from orbit.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no national borders up there,\u201d says Faiola. \u201cBut every object that is cataloged is also owned by someone, a state. And you\u2019re not allowed to touch someone else\u2019s stuff without their permission.\u201d</p><p>In August, Japan <a href=\"https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/japan-launches-international-rules-for-space-debris-removal/60484/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> it would be developing its own legal frameworks for removing space junk from orbit. And this November, in Vienna, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs will be <a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/2025-un-conference-on-space-law-and-policy.html\" target=\"_blank\">hosting a space law conference</a> to tackle these issues as well.</p><p>International agreements need reconsidering in other ways, too. Some space experts <em><em>Spectrum </em></em>spoke with argue for additional regulations to prevent orbits from further clogging up.</p><p>\u201cThere will have to be internationally coordinated agreements on who gets what orbit and how many satellites you can have in that orbit,\u201d says Smithsonian\u2019s McDowell.</p><p>Courtney envisions something like a worldwide space command network. \u201cWe need to be designing solutions that allow the growth to continue,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we need is a global space traffic control solution like we have for air traffic today.\u201d</p><p>Jah of the University of Texas at Austin argues for ultimately bringing orbital space closer to its original state of being, as he puts it, \u201ca viable commons.\u201d When a new player\u2014whether a company or a national space agency\u2014wants to put something into a given orbit, he says, that new orbiting asset should be added to a master spreadsheet somewhere.</p><p>\u201cIf another country wants to be able to be in that orbit, there should be an equitable way to share the carrying capacity of that orbit,\u201d he says.</p><p>Rockets, satellites, and launch systems today still follow the space race\u2013era legacy designs that treat orbital space like an infinite junkyard, he adds. \u201cRight now, every single object that we launch into orbit is the equivalent of a single-use plastic,\u201d Jah says. \u201cWe need to invest in reusable and recyclable satellites.\u201d</p><p>Even if the Kessler problem on the home planet can be solved, says Courtney, the same thing could happen on other planets and moons. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about low Earth orbit, but [there\u2019s also] all the commercial activity and all of the great-power competition for landing things on the moon and Mars,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWe have no space-traffic coordination solutions for <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-01/cis-lunar-space-and-the-security-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">cislunar space</a>, and yet that\u2019s the race that\u2019s just starting now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding outward into the solar system, and we\u2019re just taking these problems with us.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Ask someone in AI for their timeline, and they\u2019ll tell you when they expect the arrival of AGI\u2014artificial general intelligence\u2014which is sometimes defined as AI technology that can match the abilities of humans at most tasks. As AI\u2019s sophistication has scaled\u2014thanks to faster computers, better algorithms, and more data\u2014timelines have compressed. The leaders of major AI labs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind, have recently said they expect AGI within a few years.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>A computer system that thinks like us would enable close collaboration. Both the immediate and long-term impacts of AGI, if achieved, are unclear, but expect to see changes in the economy, scientific discovery, and geopolitics. And if AGI leads to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/can-we-stop-the-singularity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">superintelligence</a>, it may even affect humanity\u2019s placement in the predatory pecking order. So it\u2019s imperative that we track the technology\u2019s progress in preparation for such disruption. Benchmarking AI\u2019s capabilities allows us to shape legal regulations, engineering goals, social norms, and business models\u2014and to understand intelligence more broadly.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/computers-ace-iq-tests-still-make-dumb-mistakes-can-different-tests-help\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarking</a> any intellectual ability is tough, doing so for AGI presents special challenges. That\u2019s in part because people strongly disagree on its definition: Some define AGI by its performance on benchmarks, others by its internal workings, its economic impact, or vibes. So the first step toward measuring the intelligence of AI is agreeing on the general concept.</p><h3></h3><br /><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/arc-prize-agi-test\" target=\"_blank\">Are You Smarter Than an AI?</a></h2><p>Play a version of the game that researchers are using to track AI\u2019s progress toward artificial general intelligence.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Another issue is that AI systems have different strengths and weaknesses from humans, so even if we define AGI as \u201cAI that can match humans at most tasks,\u201d we can debate which tasks really count, and which humans set the standard. Direct comparisons are difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re building alien beings,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/hinton/facts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">won a Nobel Prize</a> for his work on AI.</p><p>Undaunted researchers are busy designing and proposing tests that might lend some insight into our future. But a question remains: Can these tests tell us if we\u2019ve achieved the long-sought goal of AGI?</p><h2>Why It\u2019s So Hard to Test for Intelligence</h2><p>There are infinite kinds of intelligence, even in humans. IQ tests provide a kind of summary statistic by including a range of semirelated tasks involving memory, logic, spatial processing, mathematics, and vocabulary. Sliced differently, performance on each task relies on a mixture of what\u2019s called <em>fluid</em> intelligence\u2014reasoning on the fly\u2014and <em>crystallized</em> intelligence\u2014applying learned knowledge or skills.</p><p>For humans in high-income countries, IQ tests often predict key outcomes, such as academic and career success. But we can\u2019t make the same assumptions about AI, whose abilities aren\u2019t bundled in the same way. An IQ test designed for humans might not say the same thing about a machine as it does about a person.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>There are other kinds of intelligence that aren\u2019t usually evaluated by IQ tests\u2014and are even further out of reach for most AI benchmarks. These include types of social intelligence, such as the ability to make psychological inferences, and types of physical intelligence, such as an understanding of causal relations between objects and forces or the ability to coordinate a body in an environment. Both are crucial for humans navigating complex situations.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"An old black-and-white photograph shows a man in a long coat standing next to a horse.

Or maybe test takers appear stupid only because they are unfamiliar with the testing procedure or have perceptual difficulties.</p><p>It\u2019s also hard because notions of intelligence vary across place and time. \u201cThere is an interesting shift in our society in terms of what we think intelligence is and what aspects of it are valuable,\u201d says <a href=\"https://anna-ivanova.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Ivanova</a>, an assistant professor of psychology at Georgia Tech. For example, before encyclopedias and the Internet, \u201chaving a large access to facts in your head was considered a hallmark of intelligence.\u201d Now we increasingly prize fluid over crystallized intelligence.</p><h2>The History of AI Intelligence Tests</h2><p>Over the years, many people have presented machines with grand challenges that purported to require intelligence on par with our own. In 1958, a trio of prominent AI researchers <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5392645\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>, \u201cChess is the intellectual game <em><em>par excellence.</em></em>\u2026 If one could devise a successful chess machine, one would seem to have penetrated to the core of human intellectual endeavor.\u201d They did acknowledge the theoretical possibility that such a machine \u201cmight have discovered something that was as the wheel to the human leg: a device quite different from humans in its methods, but supremely effective in its way, and perhaps very simple.\u201d But they stood their ground: \u201cThere appears to be nothing of this sort in sight.\u201d In 1997, something of this sort was very much in sight when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\" target=\"_blank\">beat Garry Kasparov</a>, the reigning chess champion, while lacking the general intelligence even to play checkers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man leans over a chess board on a desk, studying the pieces.

For decades, passing what\u2019s now called the Turing test was considered a nearly impossible challenge and a strong indicator of AGI.</p><p>But this year, researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that when people conversed with both another person and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for 5 minutes and then had to guess which one was human, they picked the AI 73 percent of the time. Meanwhile, top language models frequently make mistakes that few people ever would, like miscounting the number of times the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@anthonyokeh/llms-worst-nightmare-the-strawberry-problem-af0b95ff05c2\" target=\"_blank\">letter<em><em> r</em></em> occurs in<em><em> strawberry</em></em></a>. They appear to be more wheel than human leg. So scientists are still searching for measures of humanlike intelligence that can\u2019t be hacked.</p><h2>The ARC Test for AGI</h2><p>There\u2019s one AGI benchmark that, while not perfect, has gained a high profile as a foil for most new frontier models. In 2019, <a href=\"https://fchollet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fran\u00e7ois Chollet</a>, then a software engineer at Google and now a founder of the AI startup <a href=\"https://ndea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ndea</a>, released a paper titled \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547\" target=\"_blank\">On the Measure of Intelligence</a>.\u201d Many people equate intelligence to ability, and general intelligence to a broad set of abilities. Chollet takes a narrower view of intelligence, counting only one specific ability as important\u2014the ability to acquire new abilities easily. Large language models (LLMs) like those powering ChatGPT do well on many benchmarks only after training on trillions of written words. When LLMs encounter a situation very unlike their training data, they frequently flop, unable to adjust. In Chollet\u2019s sense, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-do-you-test-the-iq-of-ai\" target=\"_self\">they lack intelligence</a>.</p><p>To go along with the paper, Chollet created a new AGI benchmark, called the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (<a href=\"https://arcprize.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ARC</a>). It features hundreds of visual puzzles, each with several demonstrations and one test. A demonstration has an input grid and an output grid, both filled with colored squares. The test has just an input grid. The challenge is to learn a rule from the demonstrations and apply it in the test, creating a new output grid.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two examples show small colorful shapes on black grids labeled \\u201cinput\\u201d and, on grids labeled \\u201coutput,\\u201d those same shapes at a larger scale and now interlocking. The test shows another input grid with small shapes, and a blank output grid.     \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"14ef1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-examples-show-small-colorful-shapes-on-black-grids-labeled-u201cinput-u201d-and-on-grids-labeled-u201coutput-u201d-those.png?id=61614421&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus challenges AI systems to infer abstract rules from just a few examples. Given examples of input-output grids, the system must apply the hidden pattern to a new test case\u2014something humans find easy but machines still struggle with. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>ARC focuses on fluid intelligence. \u201cTo solve any problem, you need some knowledge, and then you\u2019re going to recombine that knowledge on the fly,\u201d Chollet told me. To make it a test not of stored knowledge but of how one recombines it, the training puzzles are supposed to supply all the \u201ccore knowledge priors\u201d one needs. These include concepts like object cohesion, symmetry, and counting\u2014the kind of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-computers-learn-common-sense\" target=\"_blank\">common sense</a> a small child has. Given this training and just a few examples, can you figure out which knowledge to apply to a new puzzle? Humans can do most of the puzzles easily, but AI struggled, at least at first. Eventually, OpenAI created a version of its o3 reasoning model that <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough\" target=\"_blank\">outperformed the average human test taker</a>, achieving a score of 88 percent\u2014albeit at an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11831\" target=\"_blank\">estimated computing cost</a> of US $20,000 per puzzle. (OpenAI never released that model, so it\u2019s not on the leaderboard chart.)</p><p>This March, Chollet introduced a harder version, called <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/announcing-arc-agi-2-and-arc-prize-2025\" target=\"_blank\">ARC-AGI-2</a>. It\u2019s overseen by his new nonprofit, the ARC Prize Foundation. \u201cOur mission is to serve as a North Star towards AGI through enduring benchmarks,\u201d the group announced. ARC Prize is offering a million dollars in prize money, the bulk going to teams whose trained AIs can solve 85 percent of 120 new puzzles using only four graphics processors for 12 hours or less. The new puzzles are more complex than those from 2019, sometimes requiring the application of multiple rules, reasoning for multiple steps, or interpreting symbols. The average human score is 60 percent, and as of this writing the <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\">best AI score</a> is about 16 percent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two charts show different AI models\\u2019 performance on the ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 tests, with the score on the x axis and the cost per task on the y axis.\\u00a0\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"958cd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-charts-show-different-ai-models-u2019-performance-on-the-arc-agi-1-and-arc-agi-2-tests-with-the-score-on-the-x-axis-and-the.png?id=61618135&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">AI models have made gradual progress on the first version of the ARC-AGI benchmark, which was introduced in 2019. This year, the ARC Prize launched a new version with harder puzzles, which AI models are struggling with. Models are labeled low, medium, high, or thinking to indicate how much computing power they expend on their answers, with \u201cthinking\u201d models using the most.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>AI experts acknowledge ARC\u2019s value, and also its flaws. <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/\" target=\"_blank\">Jiaxuan You</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says ARC is \u201ca very good theoretical benchmark\u201d that can shed light on how algorithms function, but \u201cit\u2019s not taking into account the real-world complexity of AI applications, such as social reasoning tasks.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://melaniemitchell.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Melanie Mitchell</a>, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute, says it \u201ccaptures some interesting capabilities that humans have,\u201d such as the ability to abstract a new rule from a few examples. But given the narrow task format, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it captures what people mean when they say general intelligence.\u201d</p><p>Despite these caveats, ARC-AGI-2 may be the AI benchmark with the biggest performance gap between advanced AI and regular people, making it a potent indicator of AGI\u2019s headway. What\u2019s more, ARC is a work in progress. Chollet says AI might match human performance on the current test in a year or two, and he\u2019s already working on ARC-AGI-3. Each task will be like a miniature video game, in which the player needs to figure out the relevant concepts, the possible actions, and the goal.</p><h2>What Attributes Should an AGI Benchmark Test?</h2><p>Researchers keep rolling out benchmarks that probe different aspects of general intelligence. Yet each also reveals how incomplete our map of the territory remains.</p><p>One recent paper introduced <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=VsJ1K2HV3k\" target=\"_blank\">General-Bench</a>, a benchmark that uses five input modalities\u2014text, images, video, audio, 3D\u2014to test AI systems on hundreds of tasks that demand recognition, reasoning, creativity, ethical judgment, and other abilities to both comprehend and generate material. Ideally, an AGI would show synergy, leveraging abilities across tasks to outperform the best AI specialists. But at present, no AI can even handle all five modalities.</p><p>Other benchmarks involve virtual worlds. An April paper in <em><em>Nature</em></em> reports on <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08744-2\" target=\"_blank\">Dreamer</a>, a general algorithm from Google DeepMind that learned to perform over 150 tasks, including playing Atari games, controlling virtual robots, and obtaining diamonds in <em><em>Minecraft</em></em>. These tasks require perception, exploration, long-term planning, and interaction, but it\u2019s unclear how well Dreamer would handle real-world messiness. Controlling a video game is easier than controlling a real robot, says <a href=\"https://danijar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danijar Hafner</a>, the paper\u2019s lead author: \u201cThe character never falls on his face.\u201d The tasks also lack rich interaction with humans and an understanding of language in the context of gestures and surroundings. \u201cYou should be able to tell your household robot, \u2018Put the dishes into that cabinet and not over there,\u2019 and you point at [the cabinet] and it understands,\u201d he says. Hafner says his team is working to make the simulations and tasks more realistic.</p><p>Aside from these extant benchmarks, experts have long debated what an ideal demonstration would look like. Back in 1970, the AI pioneer Marvin Minsky <a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/robot/1970-darrach.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em><em>Life</em></em> that in \u201cthree to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being. I mean a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight.\u201d That panel of tasks seems like a decent start, if you could operationalize the game of office politics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby.</p><p>One 2024 paper in <em><em>Engineering</em></em> proposed the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209580992300293X\" target=\"_blank\">Tong test</a> (<em><em>tong</em></em> is Chinese for \u201cgeneral\u201d). Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby, giving researchers the opportunity to observe what the AIs do. The authors argue that benchmarks should test an AI\u2019s ability to explore and set its own goals, its alignment with human values, its causal understanding, and its ability to control a virtual or physical body. What\u2019s more, the benchmark should be capable of generating an infinite number of tasks involving dynamic physical and social interactions.</p><p>Others, like Minsky, have suggested tests that require interacting with the real world to various degrees: making coffee in an unfamiliar kitchen, turning a hundred thousand dollars into a million, or attending college on campus and earning a degree. Unfortunately, some of these tests are impractical and risk causing real-world harm. For example, an AI might earn its million by scamming people.</p><p>I asked Hinton, the Nobel Prize winner, what skills will be the hardest for AI to acquire. \u201cI used to think it was things like figuring out what other people are thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s already doing some of that. It\u2019s already able to do deception.\u201d (In a recent multi-university <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, an LLM outperformed humans at persuading test takers to select wrong answers.) He went on: \u201cSo, right now my answer is plumbing. Plumbing in an old house requires reaching into funny crevices and screwing things the right way. And I think that\u2019s probably safe for another 10 years.\u201d</p><p>Researchers debate whether the ability to perform physical tasks is required to demonstrate AGI. A paper from Google DeepMind on measuring <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=0ofzEysK2D\" target=\"_blank\">levels of AGI</a> says no, arguing that intelligence can show itself in software alone. They frame physical ability as an add-on rather than a requirement for AGI.</p><p>Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute says we should test capabilities involved in doing an entire job. She noted that AI can do many tasks of a human radiologist but can\u2019t replace the human because the job entails a lot of tasks that even the radiologist doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re doing, like figuring out what tasks to do and dealing with unexpected problems. \u201cThere\u2019s such a long tail of things that can happen in the world,\u201d she says. Some robotic vacuum cleaners weren\u2019t trained to recognize dog poop, she notes, and so they smeared it around the carpet. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of stuff like that that you don\u2019t think of when you\u2019re building an intelligent system.\u201d</p><p>Some scientists say we should observe not only performance but what\u2019s happening under the hood. A recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11581\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> coauthored by <a href=\"http://jeffclune.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Clune</a>, a computer scientist at the University of British Columbia, in Canada, reports that deep learning often leads AI systems to create \u201cfractured entangled representations\u201d\u2014basically a bunch of jury-rigged shortcuts wired together. Humans, though, look for broad, elegant regularities in the world. An AI system might appear intelligent based on one test, but if you don\u2019t know the system\u2019s innards, you could be surprised when you deploy it in a new situation and it applies the wrong rule.</p><h2>AGI Is Already Here, and Never Will Be</h2><p>The author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Carroll</a> once wrote of a character who used a map of the nation \u201con the scale of a mile to the mile!\u201d before eventually using the country as its own map. In the case of intelligence testing, the most thorough map of how someone will perform in a situation is to test them in the situation itself. In that vein, a strong test of AGI might be to have a robot live a full human life and, say, raise a child to adulthood.</p><p>\u201cUltimately, the real test of the capabilities of AI is what they do in the real world,\u201d Clune told me. \u201cSo rather than benchmarks, I prefer to look at which scientific discoveries [AIs] make, and which jobs they automate. If people are hiring them to do work instead of a human and sticking with that decision, that\u2019s extremely telling about the capabilities of AI.\u201d But sometimes you want to know how well something will do <em><em>before</em></em> asking it to replace a person.</p><p>We may never agree on what AGI or \u201chumanlike\u201d AI means, or what suffices to prove it. As AI advances, machines will still make mistakes, and people will point to these and say the AIs aren\u2019t really intelligent. Ivanova, the psychologist at Georgia Tech, was on a panel recently, and the moderator asked about AGI timelines. \u201cWe had one person saying that it might never happen,\u201d Ivanova told me, \u201cand one person saying that it already happened.\u201d So the term \u201cAGI\u201d may be convenient shorthand to express an aim\u2014or a fear\u2014but its practical use may be limited. In most cases, it should come with an asterisk, and a benchmark. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cCan We Build a Better IQ Test for AI?\u201d</em></p>"

Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.<br /></p><p>Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July.

Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine\u2019s <span>3</span>,<span>500</span> miles (5,633 kilometers) of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor.

The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/the-first-all-electric-tugboat-in-the-us-is-about-to-launch\" target=\"_blank\">tugboats</a>, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.</p><p>In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world\u2019s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>Everyone\u2019s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we\u2019ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,\u201d said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. ferries</a>. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two men stand outside the cockpit of an electric boat named Heron that sits on the water.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e15a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-men-stand-outside-the-cockpit-of-an-electric-boat-named-heron-that-sits-on-the-water.jpg?id=61664831&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Maine Ocean Farms founders Eric Oransky [left] and Willy Leathers switched to an electric workboat in July 2025.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.bullockweddings.com/index/G0000YGZ6gDoqSck\" target=\"_blank\">Brendan Bullock</a></small></p><p><span>Electrification has only very recently come to the U.S. aquaculture sector.

Strater and Leathers are among the first in their business to trade gas motors for electric propulsion\u2014a switch they say they\u2019re hoping to accelerate.

Leathers\u2019s business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $<span>500</span>,<span>000</span> U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) <a href=\"https://www.aquaculturenorthamerica.com/maine-ocean-farms-adopts-electric-workboats-for-oyster-farming/#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20able%20to%20bring%20this,of%20Energy%2C%20Office%20of%20Energy%20Efficiency%20and\" target=\"_blank\">grant</a> last year that earmarked about $<span>289</span>,<span>000</span> for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.</p><p>The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.</p><p>The <span>DOE</span>\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it\u2019s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d says Strater.</p><p>But federal grants aren\u2019t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises, Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a <span>\u201c</span>marine green\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ceimaine.org/financing/small-business-loans/#marine-green-loans\" target=\"_blank\">loan program</a> that can make the up-front costs of switching to electric propulsion more accessible to small businesses.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,\u201d said Nick Branchina, director of <span>CEI</span>\u2019s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, <span>CEI</span> offers loans starting at $<span>25</span>,<span>000</span> for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.</p><p><span>Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to </span><span>\u201c</span><span>take a reasonable swing\u201d at electric propulsion.</span></p><p>Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.</p><h2>How Do Electric Boats Perform in Cold Weather?</h2><p><span></span><span>This summer, Leathers said he\u2019s had no trouble making the nearly 2-mile (3-kilometer) round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he\u2019s not sure how far the outboards\u2019 two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor\u2019s range. It\u2019s a part of Leathers\u2019s demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.</span></p><p>Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they\u2019re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of <span>2024</span>. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, <a href=\"https://www.shredelectric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shred Electric</a>, a boat\u2019s ability to run through the year\u2019s coldest months is a key selling point.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Planson. <span>\u201c</span>When you\u2019re working with\u2026waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.\u201d</p><p>Strater and Planson said their boat\u2019s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations 7 miles (11 kilometers) away. In the <span>10</span> months since the boat\u2019s launch, Strater has learned that range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat\u2019s pace depending on how far he wants to go.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d he said.</p><p><span></span><span>Soon, Maine\u2019s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level </span><span>2</span><span> charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over 2 hours, or three times as fast as the current system. The startup </span><a href=\"https://www.aqua-superpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua SuperPower</a><span> was awarded a portion of the </span><span>DOE</span><span> funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.</span></p><p>Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said Morris, of the Island Institute. As the state\u2019s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.</p><p>Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a <span>\u201c</span>chicken and egg\u201d problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there\u2019s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.</p><p>This challenge is compounded by both New England\u2019s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region\u2019s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it\u2019s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route <span>1</span>.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>There are a lot of complicated questions,\u201d Morris said. <span>\u201c</span>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to Maine, it\u2019s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.\u201d</p><p>Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm\u2019s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.</p><p><span></span><span>\u201c</span><span>As a whole industry, I think it\u2019s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,\u201d Leathers said. </span><span>\u201c</span><span>And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.\u201d</span> </p>"

In collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE History Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/globalmuseum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Global Museum</a> and the support of generous donors, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/chip-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_self\">Chip Hall of Fame</a> has been adapted into a traveling exhibit that has just begun making its way around U.S. museums, and, hopefully, the world.</p><p>Our Chip Hall of Fame celebrates microchips that have had a significant impact. Six of the chips from the hall were chosen to be part of the \u201cChips That Shook The World\u201d exhibit, along with artifacts embodying how each was used. One of the chosen was the 8-bit <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6502-microprocessor/\" target=\"_self\">6502</a> processor, so naturally we thought a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/commodore-64\" target=\"_self\">Commodore 64</a> home computer, which used a 6502 variant, should be one of the artifacts. Which led to another thought: Why not have the C64 run a program demonstrating an 8-bit CPU in action?</p><p>That\u2019s how I ended up, 35 years after I last programmed a C64, sitting at my office desk creating a brand-new plug-in cartridge.</p><p>The C64 supported <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Cartridge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plug-in cartridges</a> as a way of distributing software, and our demo program needed to be put on one. Each morning, the museum curator can just turn on the exhibit and presto! The demo program instantly begins running. The alternatives would have required the curator to type in commands to load the demo manually.</p><p>But this convenience comes with two big caveats: One, the demo has to fit into just 16 kilobytes, the maximum size of a cartridge. Even by the standards of the 1980s, this is small, as some C64 titles spanned <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Newcomer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of kilobytes</a> by loading data in chunks from disk or tape. Two, the demo would have to be written in <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-6502-assembly-and-low-level-programming-7c11fa6b9cb9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6502 assembly</a> and control the C64 video hardware directly.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"The components required to make a Commodore 64 cartridge.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"95d88\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-components-required-to-make-a-commodore-64-cartridge.png?id=61614662&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cartridges require only a few components: a printed circuit board [bottom right], programmable memory chip [bottom middle], and some resistors, diodes, and a capacitor [top middle]. They are mounted in a 3D-printed shell [top left and right]. To make the video output compatible with modern screens, we used a RetroTink-2X Pro adapter [bottom left].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Fortunately, from attending <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/theyre-alive-vintage-computer-fans-keep-the-great-machines-of-the-past-running\" target=\"_self\">Vintage Computer Federation events</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6ZCubprsSO/\" target=\"_blank\"> over the years</a>, I knew there were a lot of free or inexpensive resources that would make it easier than ever before to do this sort of thing.</p><p>The first step was to figure out just how much I could do in 16 KB. The C64\u2019s graphics hardware was groundbreaking in its day, capable of displaying images of up to 320 by 200 pixels with a palette of 16 colors. It could also display eight sprites at once; each sprite is a moveable single-color 24-by-21 pixel bitmap. The price for this power was complexity. The <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/VIC\" target=\"_blank\">video chip\u2019s control registers</a>, screen bitmaps, text-screen data, default and custom character sets, sprites, and color information all live in different locations scattered across memory, with some data actually living in <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color_RAM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">separate RAM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Character_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ROM</a> chips.</p><p>So I sat down with the detailed <a href=\"https://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">memory maps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Graphics_Modes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video hardware programming guides</a> available for the C64. (This abundance of information is in stark contrast to the 1980s, when documentation was scant, even from Commodore itself). I worked out that I could cram in nine screens of explanatory text, animated graphics, and sprites. Creating these screens, including the custom character sets and sprites they rely on, was greatly simplified thanks to the online C64 graphics editor at <a href=\"https://petscii.krissz.hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">petscii.krissz.hu</a>. The editor can output some results as stand-alone assembly programs, which I adapted as subroutines in my demo code.</p><p>I had just enough space remaining for a lucky find. I wanted to display at least one full-screen bitmapped image, but a prerendered image would have required 8 KB of data, half the cartridge\u2019s capacity. Instead I decided to use a classic hack of programmers since the days of games like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Rogue</em></em></a><em> </em>and<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Elite</em></em></a>: pulling free data out of the structure of mathematics by way of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">procedural generation</a>.</p><p>Here\u2019s where I got lucky: I came across the work of Marcello M., who had published the source for a C64 <a href=\"https://retro64.altervista.org/blog/the-mandelbrot-set-c64-assembly-program-to-draw-it-fast-using-integer-math-part-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assembly program</a> that quickly created a multicolor fractal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mandelbrot set</a> using just 3.3 KB of code. With Marcello\u2019s blessing, I incorporated his code as another subroutine.</p><h2>Modern Tools For Writing C64 Software</h2><p>The coding was done using the free <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ide65xx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IDE 65xx</a> and <a href=\"https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kick Assembler</a> desktop software. I was able to test the code using the popular C64 <a href=\"https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vice emulator</a>, which allowed me to do handy things like examining live memory contents to find runtime bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A diagram showing 64 kilobytes of RAM with a Kernal ROM occupying the top 8 KB, followed by 4 KB of character ROM, and then 8 KB of Basic ROM.

Some of these mappings overlapped: Inserting a 16-KB cartridge automatically disabled the ROM storing the Basic interpreter. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p><span>The next step was to make a physical cartridge. Again, there\u2019s modern help, this time in the form of US $5 printed circuit boards that need just a handful of components soldered in to make a cartridge. These components include a programmable ROM chip that I picked up for </span><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/363498306025\" target=\"_blank\">$3 on eBay</a><span>. I burned my code to the memory chip with my trusty </span><a href=\"http://autoelectric.cn/EN/TL866_main.html\" target=\"_blank\">TL866 programmer</a><span> and mounted it to the PCB, which in turn was mounted into a </span><a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:692797\" target=\"_blank\">3D-printed cartridge case</a><span>.</span></p><p>Then came the moment of truth. It probably won\u2019t come as a surprise to regular readers that I already own an original C64, which I connect to modern flat-screen displays via a <a href=\"https://www.retrotink.com/shop/retrotink-2x-pro\" target=\"_blank\">RetroTink-2X Pro</a> adapter. So I carefully pushed the cartridge into its slot and turned the machine on.</p><p>Naturally, my C64 immediately froze up. I had forgotten to remove a little bit of memory-management code that made the demo work in the Vice emulator by disabling the ROM that stores the C64\u2019s Basic interpreter. On the real hardware, this snippet ended up disabling half the cartridge\u2019s memory. A quick edit and a trip back to the TL866 and I was ready to try again. Success! I was finally literally ready to ship some software, all the way to <a href=\"https://www.uplandexhibits.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Upland Exhibits</a>, the people building our traveling display.</p><p>I hope you get a chance to see my little demo and our \u201cChips That Changed The World\u201d exhibit in person: We\u2019ll post current and upcoming locations on the Chip Hall of Fame page. But in the meantime, whether you used the C64 back in the day, or are just looking for a fun coding challenge, I recommend trying your hand at programming this 8-bit classic, now that so many of the original pain points have been reduced!</p>"

Regular atmospheric pressure is 10<span><sup>5</sup></span> Pa. Ultrahigh vacuum is considered to be anything less than about 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Some applications require as low as 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa. The deepest depths of space still hold the nothingness record, reaching below 10<span><sup>-20</sup></span> Pa.</p><p>The method of choice for measuring pressure in the ultrahigh vacuum regime is the ionization gauge. \u201cThey work by a fairly straightforward mechanism that dates back to vacuum tubes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/stephen-eckel\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Eckel</a>, a member of the cold-atom vacuum-measurement team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"red light shining from a circular window in a metal vacuum chamber. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4bd3f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/red-light-shining-from-a-circular-window-in-a-metal-vacuum-chamber.png?id=61612440&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A portable cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool [top] detects the fluorescence of roughly 1 million lithium atoms [bottom], and infers the vacuum pressure based on how quickly the fluorescence decays. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Photos: Jayme Thornton</small></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"small dot of red light in the middle of a circular window. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09866\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/small-dot-of-red-light-in-the-middle-of-a-circular-window.png?id=61609895&amp;width=980\" /></p><p>Indeed, an ionization gauge has the same basic components as a vacuum tube. The gauge contains a heated filament that emits electrons into the chamber. The electrons are accelerated toward a positively charged grid. En route to the grid, the electrons occasionally collide with atoms and molecules flying around in the vacuum, knocking off their electrons and creating positively charged ions. These ions are then collected by a negatively charged electrode. The current generated by these positive ions is proportional to the number of atoms floating about in the vacuum, giving a pressure reading.</p><p>Ion gauges are relatively cheap (under US $1,000) and commonplace. However, they come with a few difficulties. First, although the current in the ion gauge is proportional to the pressure in the chamber, that proportionality constant depends on a lot of fine details, such as the precise geometry of the filament and the grid. The current cannot be easily calculated from the electrical and physical characteristics of the setup\u2014ion gauges require thorough calibrations. \u201cA full calibration run on the ion gauges is like a full month of somebody\u2019s time,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/daniel-barker\" target=\"_blank\"> Daniel Barker</a>, a physicist at NIST who\u2019s also working on the cold-atom vacuum-measurement project.</p><p>Second, the calibration services provided by NIST (among others) calibrate down to only 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Performance below that pressure is questionable, even for a well-calibrated gauge. What\u2019s more, at lower pressures, the heat from the ion gauge becomes a problem: Hotter surfaces emit atoms in a process called outgassing, which pollutes the vacuum. \u201cIf you\u2019re shooting for a vacuum chamber with really low pressures,\u201d Madison says, \u201cthese ionization gauges actually work against you, and many people turn them off.\u201d</p><p>Third, the reading on the ion gauge depends very strongly on the types of atoms or molecules present in the vacuum. Different types of atoms could produce readings that vary by up to a factor of four. This variance is fine if you know exactly what\u2019s inside your vacuum chamber, or if you don\u2019t need that precise a measurement. But for certain applications, especially in research settings, these concerns are significant.</p><h2>How a cold-atom vacuum standard works</h2><p>The idea of a cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool developed as a surprising side effect of the study of cold atoms. Scientists first started cooling atoms down in an effort to make better atomic clocks back in the 1970s. Since then, cooling atoms and trapping them has become a cottage industry, giving rise to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-atomic-clocks\" target=\"_self\">optical atomic clocks</a>, atomic <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/accelerometer-quantum-bose-einstein\" target=\"_self\">navigation systems</a>, and neutral-atom quantum computers.</p><p>These experiments have to be done in a vacuum, to prevent the surrounding environment from heating the atoms. For decades, the vacuum was thought of as merely a finicky factor to be implemented as well as possible. \u201cVacuum limitations on atom traps have been known since the dawn of atom traps,\u201d Eckel says. Atoms flying around the vacuum chamber would collide with the cooled atoms and knock them out of their trap, leading to loss. The better the vacuum, the slower that process would go.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A glass cylinder with a coil inside it on a gray background. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b512d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-glass-cylinder-with-a-coil-inside-it-on-a-gray-background.png?id=61609862&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The most common vacuum-measurement tool in the high-vacuum range today is the ion gauge, basically a vacuum tube in reverse: A hot filament emits electrons that fly toward a positively charged grid, ionizing background atoms and molecules along the way. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p>UBC\u2019s Kirk Madison and his collaborator <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-booth-57a28b12/?originalSubdomain=ca\" target=\"_blank\">James Booth</a> (then at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, in Burnaby), were among the first to turn that thinking on its <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.80.022712\" target=\"_blank\">head</a> back in the 2000s. Instead of battling the vacuum to preserve the trapped atoms, they thought, why not use the trapped atoms as a <a href=\"https://patents.justia.com/patent/8803072\" target=\"_blank\">sensor</a> to measure how empty the vacuum is?<p>To understand how they did that, consider a typical cold-atom vacuum-measurement device. Its main component is a vacuum chamber filled with a vapor of a particular atomic species. Some experiments use rubidium, while others use lithium. Let\u2019s call it lithium between friends.</p><p>A tiny amount of lithium gas is introduced into the vacuum, and some of it is captured in a magneto-optical trap. The trap consists of a magnetic field with zero intensity at the center of the trap, increasing gradually away from the center. Six laser beams point toward the center from above, below, the left, the right, the front, and the back. The magnetic and laser forces are arranged so that any lithium atom that might otherwise fly away from the center is most likely to absorb a photon from the lasers, getting a momentum kick back into the trap.</p><p>The trap is quite shallow, meaning that hot atoms\u2014above 1 kelvin or so\u2014will not be captured. So the result is a small, confined cloud of really cold atoms, at the center of the trap. Because the atoms absorb laser light occasionally to keep them in the trap, they also reemit light, creating fluorescence. Measuring this fluorescence allows scientists to calculate how many atoms are in the trap.</p><p>To use this setup to measure vacuum, you load the atoms into the magneto-optical trap and measure the fluorescence. Then, you turn off the light and hold the atoms in just the magnetic field. During this time, background atoms in the vacuum will chance upon the trapped atoms, knocking them out. After a little while, you turn the light back on and check how much the fluorescence has decreased. This measures how many atoms got knocked out, and therefore how many collisions occurred.</p><p>The reason you need the trap to be so shallow and the atoms to be so cold is that these collisions are very weak. \u201cA few collisions are quite energetic, but most of the background gas particles fly by and, like, whisper to the trapped atom, and it just gently moves away,\u201d Madison says.</p><p>This method has several advantages over the traditional ion-gauge measurement. The atomic method does not need calibration; the rate at which fluorescence dims depending on the vacuum pressure can be calculated accurately. These calculations are involved, but in a paper published in 2023 the NIST team <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article/5/3/035001/2905161/Accurate-measurement-of-the-loss-rate-of-cold\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated</a> that the latest method of calculation shows excellent agreement with their experiment. Because this technique does not require calibration, it can serve as a primary standard for vacuum pressure, and even potentially be used to calibrate ion gauges.</p><p>The cold-atom measurement is also much less finicky when it comes to the actual contents of the vacuum. Whether the vacuum is contaminated with helium or plutonium, the measured pressure will vary by perhaps only a few percent, while the ion gauge sensitivity and reading for these particles might differ by an order of magnitude, Eckel says.</p><p>Cold atoms could also potentially measure much lower vacuum pressures than ion gauges can. The current lowest pressure they\u2019ve reliably measured is around 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa, and NIST scientists are working on figuring out what the lower boundary might be. \u201cWe honestly don\u2019t know what the lower limit is, and we\u2019re still exploring that question,\u201d Eckel says.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"A chart of vacuum pressures in the universe\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b1f21\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-of-vacuum-pressures-in-the-universe.png?id=61612598&amp;width=980\" /><p class=\"caption\">No vacuum is completely empty. The degree to which vacuum pressure approaches pure nothingness is measured in pascals, with Earth\u2019s atmosphere clocking in at 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and intergalactic space at a measly 10<sup>-20</sup>. In between, the new cold-atom vacuum gauges can measure further along the emptiness scale than the well-established ionization gauges can.</p><p class=\"media-photo-credit\">Sources: S.

It struggles at higher pressure, above 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa, so its applications are confined to the ultrahigh vacuum range. And, although there are no commercial atomic vacuum sensors available yet, they are likely to be much more expensive than ion gauges, at least to start.</p><p>That said, there are many applications where these devices could unlock new possibilities. At large science experiments, including LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and ones at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), well-placed cold-atom vacuum sensors could measure the vacuum pressure and also help determine where a potential leak might be coming from.</p><p>In semiconductor development, a particularly promising application is molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). MBE is used to produce the few, highly pure semiconductor layers used in laser diodes and devices for high-frequency electronics and quantum technologies. The technique functions in ultrahigh vacuum, with pure elements in separate containers heated on one end of the vacuum. The elements travel across the vacuum until they hit the target surface, where they grow one layer at a time.</p><p>Precisely controlling the proportion of the ingredient elements is essential to the success of MBE. Normally, this requires a lot of trial and error, building up thin films and checking whether the proportions are correct, then adjusting as needed. With a cold-atom vacuum sensor, the quantity of each element emitted into the vacuum can be detected on the fly, greatly speeding up the process.</p><p>\u201cIf this technique could be used in molecular-beam epitaxy or other ultrahigh vacuum environments, I think it will really benefit materials development,\u201d says <a href=\"https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/ke-zou/\" target=\"_blank\">Ke Zou</a>, an assistant professor of physics at UBC who studies molecular-beam epitaxy. In these high-tech industries, researchers may find that the ability to measure nothing is everything. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue.</em></p>"

He replaced the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar-on-a-chip\" target=\"_blank\">lidar</a> sensors when they broke\u2014which was all too often, and seemingly at random\u2014and developed complex calibration methods and maintenance routines just to keep them functioning and the cars drivable.</p><p>So, when he reached the end of his rope, he invented a more robust technology\u2014what he calls the \u201cmost powerful micromachine ever made.\u201d</p><p>Aguilar and his team at startup <a href=\"https://www.omnitronsensors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Omnitron Sensors</a> developed new micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology that he claims can produce more force per unit area than any other. By supplying new levels of power to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-lidar-sensor-uses-mirrors-to-achieve-high-efficiency\" target=\"_blank\">micromirrors</a>, the technology is capable of precisely steering lidar\u2019s laser beams, even while weathering hazardous elements and the bumps and bangs of the open road. With chips under test by auto-industry customers, Omnitron is now modifying the technology to reduce the power consumed by AI data centers.</p><p>Lidar, a scanning and detection system that uses lasers to determine how far away objects are, is often adopted by self-driving cars to find obstacles and navigate. Even as the market for lidar is expected to <a href=\"https://www.emergenresearch.com/press-release/global-light-detection-and-ranging-market?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">grow by 13.6 percent annually</a>, lidar use in the automotive industry has remained relatively stagnant in recent years, Aguilar says, in part because the technology\u2019s lifespan is so short. </p><p>Vibration from bumpy roads and severe environmental conditions are the biggest reliability killers for automotive lidar, says <a href=\"https://people.ece.uw.edu/li_mo/\" target=\"_blank\">Mo Li</a>, who studies photonic systems at the University of Washington. The optical alignment within the lidar package atop self-driving cars is delicate\u2014tremors from a poor paving job could physically alter where the mirrors sit in the housing, potentially misaligning the beam and causing the system to fail. Or temperature fluctuations could cause parts to expand or contract with the same unfortunate outcome, he explains.</p><p>Aguilar wondered which part broke most often and found the culprit to be scanners, the parts responsible for angling small mirrors that direct the laser beam out of the system\u2019s housing. He wanted to make scanners that could withstand the tough conditions lidar faces, and silicon flexures stood out as a solution. These structures act like springs and allow for meticulous control of the mirrors within lidar systems without wearing out, as the standard metal springs do, Aguilar claims.</p><h2>Designing a better chip</h2><p>Aguilar hoped the new material would be the answer to the problem that plagued him, but even silicon springs didn\u2019t make lidar systems as robust as they needed to be to withstand the elements they faced.</p><p>To make lidar even stronger, the team at Omnitron aimed to design a more powerful MEMS chip by increasing the amount of force the device can apply to control the mirrors in the lidar array. And they claim to have achieved it\u2014their chip can exert 10 times more force per unit area on an actuator that positions a micromirror or other sensor component than the current industry standard, they say. That extra force allows for extremely valuable control in fine adjustment. </p><p>To reach this achievement, they had to dig deep\u2014literally. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Golden discs on a hashed surface.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"74916\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/golden-discs-on-a-hashed-surface.jpg?id=61680607&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Omnitron\u2019s micromirrors steer lidar beams and could find use in data centers.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Omnitron</small></p><p>In this MEMS device, the mirror and its actuator are etched into a single silicon wafer. On its non-mirror end, the actuator is covered with tiny, closely spaced plates that fit between trenches in the wafer, like the interlocking teeth of two combs. To move the mirror, voltage is applied, and electrostatic forces angle the mirror into a specific position by moving the plates up and down within the trenches <span>as the electric field pulls across the trench sidewalls</span>. </p><p>The force that can be used to move the mirror is limited by the ratio of depth to width of the trenches, called aspect ratio. Put simply, the deeper the trenches are, the more electrostatic force can be applied to an actuator, which  leads to a higher range of motion for the sensor. But fabricating deep, narrow trenches is a difficult endeavor. Overcoming this limiting factor was a must for Aguilar. </p><p>Aguilar says Omnitron was able to improve on the around 20:1 aspect ratio he notes is typical for MEMS (other experts say 30:1 or 40:1 is closer to average these days) , reaching up to 100:1 through experimentation and prototyping in small university foundries across the United States \u201cThat\u2019s really our core breakthrough,\u201d Aguilar says. \u201cIt was through blood, sweat, tears, and frustration that we started this company.\u201d</p><p>The startup has secured over $800 million in letters of intent from automotive partners, Aguilar says, and is two months into an 18 month plan to prove that it can produce its chips at full demand rate. </p><p>Even after verifying production capabilities, the technology will have to face \u201cvery tough\u201d safety testing for thousands of consecutive hours in realistic conditions, like vibrations, thermal cycles, and rain, before it can come to market, Li says.</p><h2>Saving power</h2><p>In the meantime, Omnitron is applying its technology to solve a different problem faced by a different industry. By 2030, AI data centers are expected to require <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai\" target=\"_blank\">around 945 terawatt hours</a> to function\u2014more than the country of Japan consumes today. The problem is \u201cthe way data moves,\u201d Aguilar says. When data is sent from one part of the data center to another, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_self\">optical signals are converted into electrical signals, rerouted, and then turned back to optical signals</a> to be sent on their way. This process, which takes place in systems called network switches, burns huge amounts of power.</p><p>Google\u2019s solution, called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10041\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo</a>, is to keep the data packets in the form of optical signals for the duration of their travels, which yields a 40 percent power savings, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-evolution-of-googles-jupiter-data-center-network\" target=\"_blank\">the company claims</a>. Apollo does so by using an array of mirrors to direct the data. Aguilar is planning to make the process even more efficient using dense arrays of Omnitron\u2019s more powerful mirrors. Doing so could quadruple the amount of data each <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_blank\">network switch</a> could route by increasing the number of channels in each switch from 126 to 441, Aguilar says.</p><p>Omnitron is still early in its data center implementation, so it\u2019s not yet clear to what degree this technology can really improve on Google\u2019s Apollo. However, following a \u201ccritical design review\u201d in mid-September, \u201cone of the world\u2019s top AI hyperscalers has requested our mirrors for their next generation switch,\u201d Aguilar says. \u201cThis is proof that Omnitron solves a problem that even the biggest AI infrastructure companies can\u2019t address in house.\u201d</p><p>And there may be even more applications to come. Omnitron has received feelers from the defense industry, space companies, and groups interested in methane detection, says Aguilar. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool seeing the people knock on our door for this because I was just focusing on lidar,\u201d he says. </p>"

It\u2019s one of several AI-generated battery chemistries making its way to the real world.</p><p><span>Microsoft\u2019s experiment started when the researchers wanted to demonstrate how AI could tackle the needle-in-a-haystack problem of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-ion-battery\" target=\"_blank\">finding useful new materials and chemicals</a>. They decided to seek new candidates for a rechargeable battery\u2019s electrolyte, because a better electrolyte could make batteries safer while simultaneously improving performance, says </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanandrewbaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Baker</a><span>, project leader at Microsoft for </span><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Quantum Elements</a><span>, a program to accelerate chemistry and materials research through Microsoft\u2019s advanced computing and AI platforms.</span></p><p>\u201cOur goal was to take one of these AI models and show the promise of accelerating scientific discovery\u2014sifting through 32.5 million materials candidates and showing that we could do it in a matter of hours, not years,\u201d Baker says. Their model, called the M3GNet framework, accelerated simulations of molecular dynamics to evaluate properties of the materials such as atomic diffusivity.</p><p>First, the Microsoft researchers asked the model to drop new chemical elements into known crystalline structures in nature and determine which resulting molecules would be stable, a step that cut the 32 million starting candidates down to half a million. AI then screened those materials based on the necessary chemical abilities to make a battery work, which chopped the pool to just 800. From there, traditional computing and old-fashioned human expertise identified the novel material that could function within a battery and use 70 percent less lithium than the rechargeable batteries in commercial use today.</p><h2>AI\u2019s Role in Next-Gen Battery Design</h2><p>The Microsoft team isn\u2019t alone. Around the world, researchers are busy trying to develop next-generation designs to replace or improve lithium-ion batteries, which use large quantities of rare, expensive, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-tools-find-essential-battery-materials\" target=\"_blank\">difficult-to-acquire elements</a>. New battery designs could use more abundant materials, reduce the fire danger from lithium-based liquid electrolytes, and pack more energy into a smaller space. The chemistries to do this are waiting out there to be discovered, and increasingly, researchers are harnessing AI and machine learning to do the work of sorting through the mountain of data. </p><p>\u201cWe are teaching AI how to be a materials scientist,\u201d says <a href=\"https://people.njit.edu/profile/ddlab#about\" target=\"_blank\">Dibakar Datta</a>, associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, who published a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250802022915.htm\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> in August that used AI to identify five candidate materials for batteries that would outperform Li-ion. Datta\u2019s team is working on the multivalent battery: one that employs multivalent ions that can carry multiple charge levels as opposed to the single charge carried by a lithium battery. </p><p>This would give the battery a greater energy storage capacity, but it also means working with larger ions from elements higher on the periodic table, like magnesium and calcium. Those larger ions won\u2019t necessarily fit into existing battery designs without cracking or breaking the elements, Datta says. His new study used what he calls a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) that could propose new materials, and a large language model (LLM) that could find materials that would be the most stable in the real world. From a pool of millions of possibilities, the approach <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00264-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666386425002644%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">found five porous materials</a> of the right size that could do the job.</p><p>Guiding an AI model on its hunt through the nearly infinite space of possible materials is the tipping point in this field. The key to using it as a research partner is to find a happy medium between a model that works fast and a model that delivers perfectly accurate results, says <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/austin-sendek\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Austin Sendek</a>, professor at Stanford University who has developed algorithms to help AI discover new battery materials. </p><p>\u201cYou have to traverse both breadth and depth,\u201d says Sendek. Depth, because designing these things takes a lot of deep scientific knowledge about properties, engineering and chemistry, and breadth, because you have to apply that knowledge across an infinite chemical space, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s where the promise of AI comes in.\u201d </p><h2>AI Battery Technology Search at IBM</h2><p>Researchers at IBM have taken an AI-driven approach to identify <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01774-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new electrolyte candidates</a>, which involved identifying chemical formulations with far higher electric conductivity than the lithium salts used in current batteries. A typical electrolyte can contain six to eight ingredients including salts, solvents, and additives, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to consider all the combinations without AI. </p><p>To whittle down the field, the IBM team developed chemical foundation models trained on billions of molecules. \u201cThey capture the basic language of chemistry,\u201d says <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/people/young-hye-na\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Young-Hye Na</a>, Principal Research Staff Member at IBM Research. Her team then trains those models with battery-related data so the AI can predict important properties for battery applications on scales from individual molecules all the way up to a whole device. Na described the work in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01774-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a paper published in August in NPJ Computational Materials</a>.</p><p>Because the work investigates new combinations of existing materials rather than using AI to invent exotic new materials, its potential to help build the battery of tomorrow is that much more promising, Na says. The IBM team is now collaborating with an undisclosed EV manufacturer to design high-performance electrolytes for high-voltage batteries.</p><p>IBM\u2019s use of AI for batteries isn\u2019t limited to the hunt for promising materials. Typically, when AI reveals a promising new material, the next step is for experimentalists to synthesize the stuff, experiment with it in the lab, and one day to test it in a real device. Machine learning (ML) will aid researchers in this testing step, too. </p><p>IBM is testing the real-world viability of new battery setups by <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/revolutionizing-industries-with-ai-powered-digital-twins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">building their digital twins</a>\u2014virtual models that allow the researchers to predict how a particular battery chemistry would degrade over a lifetime of countless power cycles. The model, developed in collaboration with battery startup <a href=\"https://www.sphere-energy.eu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sphere Energy</a>, can predict a battery\u2019s long-term behavior in as few as 50 power cycles modeled on the digital twin, says <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/people/teodoro-laino\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Teodoro Laino</a>, distinguished research staff member at IBM Research.</p><h2>Quantum Computing Batteries</h2><p>The next phase of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-air-battery-quantum-computing\" target=\"_blank\">AI battery research is quantum</a>. As Microsoft and IBM push toward the potential of quantum computers, both see its promise to model complex chemistry with no shortcuts or compromises. Na says that while current AI is a crucial tool for investigating battery chemistry, the next step\u2014modeling whole EV battery packs, for example, and taking into consideration all the variables they encounter in the real world\u2014would require the power of quantum computing. </p><p>As Baker puts it: \u201cWe know classical computers have problems generating accurate answers for complex substances, complex molecules, complex materials. So our goal right now is actually to change the way the data is generated by bringing quantum into the loop so that we have higher accuracy data for training ML models.\u201d</p>"

But ears? That\u2019s what researchers at Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en/hsa.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oldenburg Branch for Hearing, Speech and Audio Technology</a> in Germany are building with the <a href=\"https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en/institute/projects-products/projects/the_hearing_car.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hearing Car</a>. The idea is to outfit vehicles with external microphones and AI to detect, localize, and classify environmental sounds, with the goal of helping cars react to hazards they can\u2019t see. For now, that means approaching emergency vehicles\u2014and eventually pedestrians, a punctured tire, or failing brakes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about giving the car another sense, so it can understand the acoustic world around it,\u201d says <a href=\"https://de.linkedin.com/in/moritz-brandes-861751162\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moritz Brandes</a>, a project manager for the Hearing Car.</p><h2></h2><p>In March 2025, Fraunhofer IDMT researchers drove a prototype Hearing Car 1,500 kilometers from Oldenburg to a proving ground in northern Sweden. Brandes says the trip tested the system in dirt, snow, slush, road salt, and freezing temperatures.</p><h2>How to Build a Car That Listens</h2><p>The team had a few key questions to answer: What if the microphone housings get dirty or frosted over? How does that affect localization and classification? Testing showed performance degraded less than expected once modules were cleaned and dried. The team also confirmed the microphones can survive a car wash.</p><p>Each external microphone module (EMM) contains three microphones in a 15-centimeter-wide package. Mounted at the rear of the car\u2014where wind noise is lowest\u2014they capture sound, digitize it, convert it into spectrograms, and pass it to a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/convolutional-neural-networks\" target=\"_blank\">region-based convolutional neural network </a>(RCNN) trained for audio event detection.</p><p>If the RCNN classifies an audio signal as a siren, the result is cross-checked with the vehicle\u2019s cameras: Is there a blue flashing light in view? Combining \u201csenses\u201d like this boosts the vehicle\u2019s reliability by lowering the odds of false positives. Audio signals are localized through <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/beamforming\" target=\"_self\">beamforming</a>, though Fraunhofer declined to provide specifics on the technique.</p><p>All processing happens onboard to minimize latency. That also \u201celiminates concerns about what would happen in an area with poor Internet connectivity or a lot of interference from [radio-frequency] noise,\u201d Brandes says. The workload, he adds, can be handled by a modern <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/raspberry-pi\" target=\"_self\">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p><p>According to Brandes, early benchmarks for the Hearing Car system include detecting sirens up to 400 meters away in quiet, low-speed conditions. That figure, he says, shrinks to under 100 meters at highway speeds due to wind and road noise. Alerts are triggered in about 2 seconds\u2014enough time for drivers or autonomous systems to react.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"tablet-size display indicates weather conditions ( sunny, rain, or snow), road wetness level (dry, slightly moist, and wet), and whether a siren has been detected.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f645b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/tablet-size-display-indicates-weather-conditions-sunny-rain-or-snow-road-wetness-level-dry-slightly-moist-and-wet-and.jpg?id=61641000&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This display doubles as a control panel and dashboard  letting the driver activate the vehicle\u2019s \u201chearing.\u201d</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Fraunhofer IDMT</small></p><h2>The History of Listening Cars</h2><p><span>The Hearing Car\u2019s roots stretch back more than a decade. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on making cars hear since 2014,\u201d says Brandes. Early experiments were modest: detecting a nail in a tire by its rhythmic tapping on the pavement or opening the trunk via voice command.</span></p><p>A few years later, support from a tier 1 supplier (a company that provides complete systems or major components such as transmissions, braking systems, batteries, or advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs)  directly to automobile manufacturers)<strong> </strong>pushed the work into automotive-grade development, soon joined by a major automaker. With EV adoption rising, automakers began to see why ears mattered as much as eyes.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cA human hears a siren and reacts\u2014even before seeing where the sound is coming from. An autonomous vehicle has to do the same if it\u2019s going to coexist with us safely.\u201d <strong>\u2014Eoin King, University of Galway Sound Lab</strong></p><p>Brandes recalls one telling moment: Sitting on a test track, inside an electric vehicle that was well <a href=\"https://b-quiet.com/blogs/resources/sound-deadening-solutions-for-electric-vehicles#:~:text=Acoustic%20Foam%20Panels,cabin%20optimally%20quiet%20and%20comfortable.\" target=\"_blank\">insulated against road noise</a>, he failed to hear an emergency siren until the vehicle was nearly upon him. \u201cThat was a big \u2018ah-ha!\u2019 moment that showed how important the Hearing Car would become as EV adoption increased,\u201d he says.</p><h2></h2><p><a href=\"https://ie.linkedin.com/in/eoin-king-b4b29627\" target=\"_blank\">Eoin King</a>, a mechanical engineering professor at the <a href=\"https://www.universityofgalway.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Galway</a> in Ireland, sees the leap from physics to AI as transformative.</p><p>\u201cMy team took a very physics-based approach,\u201d he says, recalling his <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003682X20307787\" target=\"_blank\">2020 work in this research area</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.hartford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Hartford</a> in Connecticut. \u201cWe looked at direction of arrival\u2014measuring delays between microphones to triangulate where a sound is. That demonstrated feasibility. But today, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_self\">AI</a> can take this much further. Machine listening is really the game changer.\u201d</p><p>Physics still matters, King adds: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like physics-informed AI. The traditional approaches show what\u2019s possible. Now, machine learning systems can generalize far better across environments.\u201d</p><h2>The Future of Audio in Autonomous Vehicles</h2><h2></h2><p>Despite progress, King, who directs the <a href=\"https://www.thegalwaysoundlab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Galway Sound Lab</a>\u2019s research in acoustics, noise, and vibration, is cautious.</p><p>\u201cIn five years, I see it being niche,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes time for technologies to become standard. <a href=\"https://mycardoeswhat.org/deeper-learning/lane-departure-warning/\" target=\"_blank\">Lane-departure warnings</a> were niche once too\u2014but now they\u2019re everywhere. Hearing technology will get there, but step by step.\u201d <span>Near-term deployment will likely appear in premium vehicles or autonomous fleets, with mass adoption further off.</span></p><p>King doesn\u2019t mince words about why audio perception matters: Autonomous vehicles must coexist with humans. <span>\u201cA human hears a siren and reacts\u2014even before seeing where the sound is coming from.

King points to another area of concern: false alarms.</p><p>\u201cIf you train a car to stop when it hears someone yelling \u2018help,\u2019 what happens when kids do it as a prank?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe have to test these systems thoroughly before putting them on the road. This isn\u2019t consumer electronics, where, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-reliability\" target=\"_self\">if ChatGPT gives you the wrong answer</a>, you can just rephrase the question\u2014people\u2019s lives are at stake.\u201d</p><p>Cost is less of an issue: microphones are cheap and rugged. The real challenge is ensuring algorithms can make sense of noisy city soundscapes filled with horns, garbage trucks, and construction.</p><p>Fraunhofer is now refining algorithms with broader datasets, including sirens from the United States, Germany, and Denmark. Meanwhile, King\u2019s lab is improving sound detection in indoor contexts, which could be repurposed for cars.</p><p>Some scenarios\u2014like a Hearing Car detecting a red-light-runner\u2019s engine revving before it\u2019s visible\u2014may be many years away, but King insists the principle holds: \u201cWith the right data, in theory it\u2019s possible. The challenge is getting that data and training for it.\u201d</p><p>Both Brandes and King agree no single sense is enough. Cameras, radar, lidar\u2014and now microphones\u2014must work together. <span>\u201cAutonomous vehicles that rely only on vision are limited to line of sight,\u201d King says. \u201cAdding acoustics adds another degree of safety.\u201d</span></p>"

The long-term vision is for iRonCub (or a robot like it) to operate as a disaster response platform, Pucci tells us. In an emergency situation like a flood or a fire, iRonCub could quickly get to a location without worrying about obstacles, and then on landing, start walking for energy efficiency while using its hands and arms to move debris and open doors. \u201cWe believe in contributing to something unique in the future,\u201d says Pucci. \u201cWe have to explore new things, and this is wild territory at the scientific level.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, this concept for iRonCub and the practical experimentation attached to it is really cool. But coolness in and of itself is usually not enough of a reason to build a robot, especially a robot that\u2019s a (presumably rather expensive) multi-year project involving a bunch of robotics students, so let\u2019s get into a little more detail about why a flying robot baby is actually something that the world needs.</p><hr /> <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In an emergency situation like a flood or a fire, iRonCub could quickly get to a location without worrying about obstacles, and then on landing, start walking for energy efficiency while using its hands and arms to move debris and open doors.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">IIT</small> </p><p><span>Getting a humanoid robot to do this sort of thing is quite a challenge. Together, the jet turbines mounted to iRonCub\u2019s back and arms can generate over 1000 N of thrust, but because it takes time for the engines to spool up or down, control has to come from the robot itself as it moves its arm-engines to maintain stability. </span></p><p><span>\u201cWhat is not visible from the video,\u201d Pucci tells us, \u201cis that the exhaust gas from the turbines is at 800 \u00b0C and almost supersonic speed. We have to understand how to generate trajectories in order to avoid the fact that the cones of emission gases were impacting the robot.\u201d </span></p><p><span>Even if the exhaust doesn\u2019t end up melting the robot, there are still aerodynamic forces involved that have until this point really not been a consideration for humanoid robots at all\u2014in June, Pucci\u2019s group </span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00447-w\" target=\"_blank\">published a paper in <em>Nature Engineering Communications</em></a><span>, offering a \u201ccomprehensive approach to model and control aerodynamic forces [for humanoid robots] using classical and learning techniques.\u201d</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cThe exhaust gas from the turbines is at 800 \u00b0C and almost supersonic speed.\u201d <strong>\u2014Daniele Pucci, IIT</strong> </span></p><p>Whether or not you\u2019re on board with Pucci\u2019s future vision for iRonCub as a disaster-response platform, derivatives of current research can be immediately applied beyond flying humanoid robots. The algorithms for thrust estimation can be used with other flying platforms that rely on directed thrust, like eVTOL aircraft. Aerodynamic compensation is relevant for humanoid robots even if they\u2019re not airborne, if we expect them to be able to function when it\u2019s windy outside.</p><p>More surprising, Pucci describes a recent collaboration with an industrial company developing a new pneumatic gripper. \u201cAt a certain point, we had to do force estimation for controlling the gripper, and we realized that the dynamics looked really similar to those of the jet turbines, and so we were able to use the same tools for gripper control. That was an \u2018ah-ha\u2019 moment for us: first you do something crazy, but then you build the tools and methods, and then you can actually use those tools in an industrial scenario. That\u2019s how to drive innovation.\u201d</p><h2>What\u2019s Next for iRonCub: Attracting Talent and Future Enhancements</h2><p>There\u2019s one more important reason to be doing this, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s really cool.\u201d In practice, a really cool flagship project like iRonCub not only attracts talent to Pucci\u2019s lab, but also keeps students and researchers passionate and engaged. I saw this firsthand when I visited IIT last year, where I got a similar vibe to watching the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/darpa-robotics-challenge-amazing-moments-lessons-learned-whats-next\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA Robotics Challenge</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/darpa-subterranean-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA SubT</a>\u2014when people know they\u2019re working on something <em><em>really cool</em></em>, there\u2019s this tangible, pervasive, and immersive buzzing excitement that comes through. It\u2019s projects like iRonCub that can get students to love robotics.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the near future, a new jetpack with an added degree of freedom will make yaw control of iRonCub easier, and Pucci would also like to add wings for more efficient long-distance flight. But the logistics of testing the robot are getting more complicated\u2014there\u2019s only so far that the team can go with their current test stand (which is on the roof of their building), and future progress will likely require coordinating with the Genoa airport. </p><p>It\u2019s not going to be easy, but as Pucci makes clear, \u201cThis is not a joke. It\u2019s something that we believe in. And that feeling of doing something exceptional, or possibly historical, something that\u2019s going to be remembered\u2014that\u2019s something that\u2019s kept us motivated. And we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p>"
