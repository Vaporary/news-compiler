The annual number of visas allocated to for-profit firms is capped at 85,000 and there is excess demand for those visas. The analysis merges data from the Labor Condition Application where firms attest that H-1B hires do not adversely impact natives, the I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker where firms request to hire a specific person, and the American Community Surveys. On average, H-1B workers earn 16 percent less than comparable natives. The payroll savings suggest that firms may be willing to pay a one-time fee to obtain an H-1B visa. The data are examined using a labor demand model to simulate how a fee alters the hiring decision. Depending on the level of excess demand, the unobserved productivity gains or costs from an H-1B hire, and the rate of job separations, the revenue-maximizing fee is between $118,000 and $264,000, has little or no impact on the number of H-1Bs hired, and generates between $6.2 and $22.4 billion in revenues. The fee would also change the skill composition of the H-1B workforce, making it more skilled."

        "summary": "This study provides evidence that geopolitical considerations systematically shape funding evaluations of international collaboration proposals. We examine this dynamic in the consequential context of U.S.\u2013China collaboration. Across two large-scale randomized experiments with U.S. policymakers and U.S.-based scientists, we find substantial and consistent penalties for proposals involving China-based collaborators. Policymakers express much greater unconditional support for proposals with Germany-based collaborators than for otherwise identical proposals with China-based collaborators (68% vs. 28%). Crucially, this penalty is not confined to policymakers: scientists themselves exhibit a sizeable 18 percentage-point gap (48% vs. 30%), despite professional expectations of merit-based evaluation. Much of the difference reflects a shift from unconditional to conditional approval rather than outright rejection. These penalties are remarkably consistent across scientific fields and respondent characteristics, with little evidence of heterogeneity, indicating that they reflect geopolitical rather than domain-specific concerns. Overall, the findings suggest that geopolitics influences gatekeeping judgments in government funding, with broad implications for peer review, scientific norms, and the future of international collaboration in an era of intensifying geopolitical competition."

We impute the legal status for each worker in the American Community Survey by combining detailed individual information with group-level visa records. In 2024, 3.2% of US workers were unauthorized, but some regions and sectors were heavily dependent on unauthorized immigrant labor. We develop a dynamic quantitative framework with multiple regions, sectors and occupations, heterogeneous workers, and endogenous capital accumulation to study the economic impacts of removing unauthorized workers. We derive analytical expressions relating region- and occupation-specific real wages and sectoral relative prices to changes in the supply of immigrant workers, observable factor shares, and combinations of structural elasticities. Following the removal of 50% of unauthorized immigrants, in the short run average native real wages rise 0.15% nationally, driven by an increase in the capital-labor ratio. In the long run, however, native real wages fall in every state, and by 0.33% nationally, as capital gets decumulated in response to a lower population. Consumer prices in the sectors intensive in unauthorized workers \u2013 such as Farming \u2013 rise by about 1% relative to the price of the average consumption basket, while most other sectors experience negligible relative price changes."

        "summary": "We develop a New Keynesian model with financial frictions to study how corporate capital structure shapes static and dynamic monetary policy tradeoffs through the supply side. Ex post, when corporate leverage is high, monetary tightening contracts both demand and supply. As a result, the Phillips curve is highly non-linear and state-dependent, and the \u201cnatural rate\u201d R\u207f ensuring price stability increases with corporate leverage. Yet the tradeoff between inflation targeting and tightening supply constraints implies that the optimal ex-post policy is to set a rate R\u1d52\u1d56\u1d57 < R\u207f that can decrease with leverage. Ex ante, firms\u2019 market-timing incentives lead them to increase leverage when rates are low, which creates an intertemporal tradeoff: monetary easing supports current demand but hurts future supply, which makes easing partially self-defeating. The optimal ex-ante monetary policy features a prudential motive for leaning against leverage even when the divine coincidence holds in the current period."

        "summary": "Measuring aggregate inflation is subject to two opposing biases: unobserved quality and variety growth, and the use of incorrect weights when new varieties are misclassified. We show that it is possible to measure an aggregate price index free of these biases when we have a subset of products where these two errors average to zero. This procedure does not require us to distinguish new from existing goods, measure quality attributes directly, or classify new varieties into the appropriate category. We implement this approach using BEA data from 1959 to 2019, approximating the official PCE price index with a CES aggregate of BEA prices at the product level. Our estimate of the inflation rate exceeds the CES aggregate of BEA prices by 0.3 to 1.0 percentage points per year on average. The aggregate bias was close to zero prior to the BLS introducing hedonic adjustments, which suggests that only adjusting for quality bias can lead to an underestimation of overall inflation, particularly in quality-adjusted categories."

We document substantial changes in the ratio of aggregate employment to working-age population across countries that are not systematically related to productivity growth or income levels, yet tightly linked to the rise in services employment. We assess the quantitative contribution of changes in aggregate employment to the rise of services using an otherwise standard model of sectoral reallocation calibrated to time-series for the United States. The calibrated model implies a high elasticity of changes in aggregate employment to services: a one percentage point change in aggregate employment generates on average a 0.7 percentage point change in services employment. The implication is that actual changes in aggregate employment account for one-third of the rise in services, on average across countries, and up to one-half in countries with sustained employment increases."

The Photo Big 5 provides predictive power comparable to race, attractiveness, and educational background, and is only weakly correlated with cognitive measures such as test scores. We show that individuals systematically sort into occupations where their personality traits are valued and earn higher wages when traits align with occupational demands. While the scalability of the Photo Big 5 enables new academic insights into the role of personality in labor markets, its growing use in industry screening raises important ethical concerns regarding statistical discrimination and individual autonomy."

        "summary": "In the United States, much of the gap in earnings between men and women is due to the persistent gap for high wage earners. This paper explores changes in the gender wage gap for MBAs graduating from a large public university over 30 years. We document large gender wage gaps on average, which grow in the course of men\u2019s and women\u2019s careers. Comparing graduates at identical career stages across time periods to address composition concerns, we show that the raw gender wage gap has shrunk by 33 to 50 percent over the last two decades. Additionally, the temporal pattern of the gap has fundamentally shifted: while gaps only emerged over time in earlier decades, significant gaps now emerge immediately. Convergence in labor supply factors, particularly hours worked, explains much of the narrowing gap, alongside shifts in industry composition. However, unexplained wage gaps persist for recent graduates from the very start of their careers, suggesting different underlying mechanisms across cohorts. These findings highlight both progress in gender wage equity among business professionals and concerning patterns that emerge earlier in careers than in previous decades."

This chapter synthesizes randomized experiments embedded in live peer-evaluation systems at journals, conferences, and funding agencies, restricting attention to published studies. I organize this evidence using a Q\u2013A\u2013R\u2013S framework that decomposes peer review into attributes of submissions (Q), authors (A), reviewers (R), and evaluation systems (S), and interpret outcomes through a view of the core problem of scientific evaluation as assessing new knowledge using the existing stock of knowledge.\nThe chapter treats experimental design choices as objects of analysis, assessing what existing interventions can\u2014and cannot\u2014identify given their designs and settings, the institutional constraints they face, and opportunities for higher-leverage experimentation. I show that randomized experimentation embedded in peer review spans the full Q\u2013A\u2013R\u2013S space, albeit sparsely, and yields uneven but informative insights across different margins.\nBased on the full body of evidence, I advance several novel claims: (1) system interventions often affect participant behavior with little impact on core evaluative judgments; (2) core evaluations are most clearly shaped by who reviews and their expertise; and (3) peer review functions more reliably as a \u201cfilter\u201d of poor submissions than as a fine-grained \u201cranker\u201d of acceptable submissions. Overall, the evidence points to a functioning institution operating under binding epistemic and organizational constraints, rather than to systemic failure. I identify channels for improving the speed, cost, and reliability of scientific evaluation institutions.\nSubstantial scope remains to redesign embedded experiments to increase inferential power, generalizability, and cumulative insight, while reducing disruption and more tightly linking to institutional innovation and policy changes."

But there are no socio-technical standards for manufacturers to follow.</p><p>In response, the <a href=\"https://brain.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Brain technical community</a> is developing the IEEE P7700 standard: \u201c<a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7700/11038/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Recommended Practice for the Responsible Design and Development of Neurotechnologies</a>.\u201d</p><p>The proposed standard is being designed to provide a uniform set of definitions and a methodology to assess the ethical and socio-technical considerations and practices regarding the design, development, and use of neurotechnologies including wearable neurodevices for the brain, says <a href=\"https://sites.psu.edu/neuroethicslab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Y. Cabrera</a>, the standard\u2019s working group chair. Cabrera, an IEEE senior member, is an associate professor in the engineering science and mechanics department at <a href=\"https://www.psu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pennsylvania State University</a> in University Park. Her research focuses on the ethical and societal implications of neurotechnologies.</p><p>\u201cIEEE P7700 addresses the unique characteristics of the technology and its impact on individuals and society, in particular, as it moves from therapeutic users to a wide variety of consumers,\u201d she says.</p><p>The standard is sponsored by the <a href=\"https://technologyandsociety.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology</a>.</p><h2>Concern over long-term effects</h2><p>The multilayered complexity of technologies that interface with the brain and nervous system presents considerations to those developing them, Cabrera says.</p><p>\u201cThere may be long-term consequences in our brains with these types of technologies,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if they were used for a short period of time, there might not be significant consequences. But what are the effects over time?\u201d</p><p>Patients using approved brain-stimulation technology, for example, are told of its risks and benefits, but the long-term effects of headbands to improve students\u2019 attention span aren\u2019t known.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIEEE P7700 addresses the unique characteristics of the technology and its impact on individuals and society, in particular, as it moves from therapeutic users to a wide variety of consumers.\u201d</p><p>IEEE P7700 will address potential risks to individuals and possible negative impacts on society, Cabrera says. That includes creating guardrails to prevent harm, she adds.</p><p>The cultural implications of using neurotechnologies that interface with the brain also need to be considered, she says, because people have different views.</p><p>\u201cThe brain is considered the seed of the self and the organ that orchestrates all our thoughts, behaviors, feelings, and emotions,\u201d she says. \u201cThe brain is really central to who we are.\u201d</p><h2>Developing an ethical framework</h2><p>For the past five years, the <a href=\"https://brain.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Brain community</a>\u2019s neuroethics committee has been developing a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ethical-guidelines-in-the-works-for-developers-of-brain-technologies\" target=\"_self\">framework</a> to evaluate the ethical, legal, social, and cultural issues that could emerge from use of the technology. The document covers nine types of applications, including those used for wellness.</p><p>Because more devices kept entering the market, IEEE Brain decided in 2023 that it was time to begin drafting a standard.</p><p>Members of its working group come from Argentina, China, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States. Participants include developers, engineers, ethicists, lawyers, and social science researchers.</p><p>The standard, Cabrera says, will be the first socio-technical standard aimed at fostering the ethical and responsible innovation of neurotechnology that meets societal and community values at an international level. P7700 will include a how-to guide, criteria for evaluating each suggested process, and case studies to help with the interpretation and practical use of the standard, she says.</p><p>\u201cOur applied ethical approach uses a responsible research and innovation method to enable developers, researchers, users, and regulators to anticipate and address ethical and sociocultural implications of neurotechnologies, mitigating negative unintended consequences while increasing community support and engagement with innovators,\u201d Cabrera says.</p><p>The working group is seeking additional participants to help refine the process, tools, and recommendations.</p><p>\u201cThere are a variety of people who can contribute their expertise,\u201d she says, \u201cincluding academics, data scientists, government program leaders, policymakers, lawyers, social scientists, and users.\u201d</p><p>Cabrera says she anticipates the standard will be published early next year.</p><p>You can register to <a href=\"https://development.standards.ieee.org/myproject-web/public/view.html#/interest/9521\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">participate in the standard\u2019s development here</a>.</p>"

My answer: Regulate AI use, not the underlying models.</span></p><h2>Why model-centric regulation fails</h2><p><span><span>Proposals to license \u201cfrontier\u201d training runs, restrict open weights, or require permission before publishing models, such as California\u2019s </span></span><a href=\"https://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB53/id/3270002\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, </span></span></a><span><span>promise </span><span>control</span> but deliver theater. Model weights and code are digital artifacts; once released, by a lab, a leak, or a foreign competitor, they replicate at near-zero cost. You </span><span>can\u2019t</span> unpublish weights, geofence research, or prevent distillation into smaller models. Trying to bottle up artifacts yields two bad outcomes: Compliant firms drown in paperwork, while reckless <span>actors</span> route around rules offshore, underground, or both.</p><p><span>In the United States, model-publication licensing also likely collides with speech law. Federal courts have treated software source code as protected expression, so any system that prevents the publication of AI models would be vulnerable to legal challenges. </span></p><p><span><span>\u201cDo nothing\u201d is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">not an option</a> either. Without guardrails, we will keep seeing </span></span><a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/increasing_threats_of_deepfake_identities_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>deepfake scams</span></span></a><span><span>, automated fraud, and mass-persuasion campaigns until a headline catastrophe triggers a blunt response </span><span>optimized</span> for optics, not outcomes.</span></p><h2>A practical alternative: Regulate use, proportionate to risk</h2><p><span><span>A use-based regime classifies deployments by risk and scales obligations accordingly. Here is a workable template focused on keeping enforcement where systems </span><span>actually touch</span> people:</span></p><ol start=\"1\"><li><span><strong>Baseline: General-purpose consumer interaction</strong></span><span> (open-ended chat, creative writing, learning </span><span>assistance</span><span>, casual productivity). </span> <br /><span>Regulatory adherence: clear AI disclosure at point of interaction, published acceptable-use policies, technical guardrails preventing escalation into higher-risk tiers, and a mechanism for users to flag problematic outputs.</span> </li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><span><strong><span>Low-risk </span><span>assistance</span></strong></span><span> (drafting, summarization</span><span>, basic</span> productivity). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> simple disclosure, baseline data hygiene. </li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><span><strong>Moderate-risk decision support affecting individuals</strong></span> (hiring triage, benefits screening, loan prequalification). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> documented risk assessment, meaningful human oversight, and an \u201cAI bill of materials\u201d consisting of at least the model lineage, key evaluations, and mitigations. </li></ol><ol start=\"4\"><li><span><strong>High-impact uses in safety-critical contexts</strong></span> (clinical decision support, critical-infrastructure operations). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em><span> rigorous predeployment testing tied to the specific use, continuous monitoring, incident reporting, and, when </span><span>warranted</span><span>, authorization linked to validated performance.</span> </li></ol><ol start=\"5\"><li><span><strong>Hazardous dual-use functions</strong></span> (for example, tools to fabricate biometric voiceprints to defeat authentication). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> <span>confine to</span> licensed facilities and verified operators; prohibit capabilities whose primary purpose is unlawful. <br /> <br /><span><h2>Close the loop at real-world choke points</h2></span><span>AI-enabled systems become real when they\u2019re connected to users, money, infrastructure, and institutions, and that\u2019s where regulators should focus enforcement: at the points of distribution (app stores and enterprise marketplaces), capability access (cloud and AI platforms), monetization (payment systems and ad networks), and risk transfer (insurers and contract counterparties).</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>For high-risk uses, we need to require identity binding for operators, capability gating aligned to the risk tier, and tamper-evident logging for audits and postincident review, paired with privacy protections. We need to demand evidence for deployer claims, </span><span>maintain</span> incident-response plans, report material faults, and provide human fallback. When AI use leads to damage, firms should have to show their work and face liability for harms.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>This approach creates market dynamics that accelerate compliance. If </span></span><span><span>crucial business operations such as </span></span><span><span>procurement, access to cloud </span></span><span>services</span><span><span>, and insurance depend on proving that </span><span>you</span></span><span><span>\u2019re</span> following the rules</span><span><span>, AI model developers will </span><span>build to</span> specifications buyers can check. That raises the safety floor for a</span><span><span>ll industry </span><span>players,</span> startups included, </span><span>without handing an advantage to a few large, licensed incumbents.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>The E.U. approach: How this aligns, where it differs</h2></span><span><span>This framework aligns with the E.U. AI Act in two important ways. First, it centers risk at the point of impact: The act\u2019s \u201chigh-risk\u201d categories include employment, education, access to essential services, and critical infrastructure, with life-cycle obligations and complaint rights. It also recognizes special treatment for broadly capable systems (GPAI) without pretending publication control is a safety strategy. My proposal for the United States differs in three </span><span>key ways</span><span>:</span></span> <br /> <br /><span>First, the U.S. must design for constitutional durability. Courts have treated source code as protected speech, and a regime that requires permission to publish weights or train a class of models starts to resemble prior restraint. A use-based regime of rules governing what AI operators can do in sensitive settings, and under what conditions, fits more naturally within the U.S. First Amendment doctrine than speaker-based licensing schemes.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>Second, </span><span>the</span> E.U. can rely on platforms adapting to the precautionary rules it writes for its unified single market. The U.S. should accept that models will exist globally, both open and closed, and focus on where AI becomes actionable: app stores, enterprise platforms, cloud providers, enterprise identity layers, payment rails, insurers, and regulated-sector gatekeepers (hospitals, utilities, banks). Those are enforceable points where identity, logging, capability gating, and postincident accountability can be </span><span>required</span> without pretending we can \u201ccontain\u201d software. They also span the many specialized U.S. agencies that may not be able to write higher-level rules broad enough to affect the whole AI ecosystem. Instead, the U.S. should regulate AI service choke points more explicitly than Europe does, to accommodate the different shape of its government and public administration. <br /> <br /><span>Third, the U.S. should add an explicit \u201cdual-use hazard\u201d tier. The E.U. AI Act is primarily a fundamental-rights and product-safety regime. The United States also has a national-security reality: Certain capabilities are dangerous because they scale harm (biosecurity, cyberoffense, mass fraud). A coherent U.S. framework should name that category and regulate it directly, rather than trying to fit it into generic \u201cfrontier model\u201d licensing.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>China\u2019s approach: What to reuse, what to avoid</h2></span><span><span>China has built a layered regime for public-facing AI. The \u201cdeep synthesis\u201d rules (effective 10 January 2023) require conspicuous labeling of synthetic media and place duties on providers and platforms. The </span></span><span><strong>I</strong></span><span>nterim Measures for Generative AI (effective 15 August 2023) add registration and governance obligations for services offered to the public. Enforcement leverages platform control and algorithm filing systems.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>The United States should not copy China\u2019s state-directed control of AI viewpoints or information management; it is incompatible with U.S. values and would not survive U.S. constitutional scrutiny. The licensing of model publication is brittle in practice and, in the United States, </span><span>likely an</span> unconstitutional </span><span>form of censorship</span><span>.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>But we can borrow two practical ideas from China. First, we should ensure trustworthy provenance and traceability for synthetic media. This involves mandatory labeling and </span><span>provenance</span> <span>forensic </span><span>tools. They give legitimate creators and platforms a reliable way to prove origin and integrity. When it is quick to check authenticity at scale, attackers lose the advantage of cheap copies or </span><span>deepfakes</span> and defenders regain time to detect, triage, and respond. Second, we should require </span><span>operators to</span> file their methods <span>and risk controls </span><span>with </span><span>regulators</span> for public-facing, high-risk services, like we do for other <span>safety-critical</span> projects. This should include due-process and transparency safeguards <span>appropriate to</span> liberal democracies along with clear responsibility for safety measures, data protection, and incident handling, especially for systems designed to manipulate emotions or build dependency, which already include gaming, role-playing, and <span>associated applications</span><span>.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>A pragmatic approach</h2></span><span><span>We cannot meaningfully regulate the development of AI in a world where artifacts copy in near real time and research flows fluidly across borders. But we can keep unvetted systems out of hospitals, payment systems, and critical infrastructure by regulating uses, not models; </span><span>enforcing at</span> choke points; and applying obligations that scale with risk. </span> <br /> <br /><span><span>Done right, this approach harmonizes with the E.U.\u2019s outcome-oriented framework, channels U.S. federal and state innovation into a coherent baseline, and reuses China\u2019s useful distribution-level controls while rejecting speech-restrictive licensing. We can write rules that protect people </span></span><span>and that still promote robust AI innovation.</span> <br /> </li></ol>"

One I faced was whether to participate in a development project involving teams from around the world. It presented a great opportunity for personal and professional enrichment.</p><p>Throughout my 40-year career with <a href=\"https://www.honeywell.com/us/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Honeywell</a>, I have held leadership roles for such projects in Australia, China, Finland, and India.</p><p>You might be offered similar assignments. Here are some benefits of taking on international projects.</p><h2>Gain professional insights and advancement</h2><p>As a rule, international projects are large in scope and involve many critical components, making them ideal for your professional growth. Such projects are likely to be identified by your organization as essential to the business and, as such, present opportunities for individual achievement and recognition.</p><p>They also can give you the opportunity to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/advice-leading-mentoring-greater-innovation\" target=\"_self\">work with many technical aspects</a>\u2014which would allow you to see beyond the scope of smaller-scale projects.</p><p>Likewise, you can gain an understanding of different global markets and how to meet diverse customer needs.</p><p>It can significantly expand your company\u2019s market reach to enter new geographic areas. It also can lead to a better understanding of local preferences, regulations, and technical standards, making the products more appealing to customers in other countries.</p><h2>Planning for working globally</h2><p>When embarking on a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotic-process-automation-gokul-pandy\" target=\"_self\">global, multisite assignment,</a> seek help to define your role. The project could require you to take on several different positions such as project manager, program manager, scrum leader, architect, requirements analyst, designer, and user experience lead. Which role would be best suited for you? You should decide based on your skills, long-term career growth, and the project\u2019s needs.</p><p>Regardless of which role you have, it is important to have an understanding of the team\u2019s other members, including their skills and competencies and how best to interact with them.</p><p>A key decision early on is whether you\u2019ll have to colocate at one location and, if so, for how long. There are different types of colocation, including frequent travel between offices, a temporary relocation known as a \u201cbubble assignment,\u201d and an expatriate assignment that involves relocating to another country for a period of time.</p><p>Travel between offices makes sense when there are more than two locations involved in the project and your role requires your presence at each. Although weekly communication can be done via virtual meetings, there is no substitute for occasional face-to-face interaction.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Participation in global product development empowers engineers to drive innovation, achieve career growth, and make a meaningful impact in the global marketplace and on society itself.</span></p><p>Bubble assignments require longer on-site presence but without the rigor and complexity of an expat assignment. Generally, bubble assignments last three to six months.</p><p>Expat assignments are suitable when the project scope requires a multiyear engagement. They involve relocating to that country for the duration of the project. You and your employer should be clear about taxes, salary, benefits, housing, and other implications.</p><p>Your compensation is a significant consideration. It\u2019s not just about how much money you earn. Consider maintaining your salary in your home country\u2019s currency. The benefits include maintaining your bank and automatic payroll deposits, avoiding currency fluctuation and potentially adverse inflation.</p><p>Depending on the length of your stay, you might have to pay income tax in several countries. Make sure you understand the tax implications before embarking on any long assignments.</p><p>In addition, find out about your health insurance coverage when living abroad.</p><h2>Trust is the word</h2><p>Many critical aspects define a successful global assignment, including communication across time zones, managing cultural barriers and expectations, ensuring each site has employees with the expertise and skills needed, and setting clear project goals and time frames.</p><p>Most importantly, establish and maintain trust. Every member on the global team must have everyone\u2019s best interests, including the company\u2019s, in mind.</p><p>Trust is not easily gained, but it can be easily\u2014and quickly\u2014lost. To establish trust, the project leadership must be transparent, communicate frequently, set clear goals and boundaries, and define roles that match the participants\u2019 skills, capabilities, and long-term interests.</p><p>It\u2019s also critical that you and your team fulfill your promises on time.</p><h2>Overcoming challenges</h2><p>Large, complex, multilocation projects present other significant challenges that must be understood and managed.</p><p>Think about your company\u2019s organizational structure and boundaries. Is there a consistent reporting structure with shared goals and expectations? Or are there potentially competing interests at the executive level?</p><p>If the latter, think about how you will navigate those boundaries. And find a way to align the organization in a way that benefits all participants and teams.</p><p>A method Honeywell has used to navigate such challenges is to create a \u201chub and spoke\u201d approach to the critical disciplines of program management, architecture, and design. The approach includes offering management, verification, validation, and quality assurance with the intent that each participating site has representation in all four cornerstone areas.</p><p>Consider your computer systems. Is your company set up to allow for IT collaboration across sites and geographic boundaries? Having the right multisite computing privileges to ensure frictionless virtual teamwork is vital.</p><p>Are there legal issues such as export restrictions or government regulations? Are there intellectual property constraints when working with other countries? Also consider other impediments such as tariffs and customs duties; where the parts of your product are manufactured; product and component licensing; and use of open-source technology.</p><p>Addressing those issues starts with training the workforce in different countries about company-approved methods and restrictions, as well as having multisite tools that allow for intercountry collaboration.</p><h2>Discover personal enrichment</h2><p>In addition to contributing to your professional growth, actively engaging in a global development project can be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/influence-your-career\" target=\"_self\">personally enriching</a>. Working with people in different countries, with distinct cultures and languages, can broaden your understanding of the world and can create lasting friendships.</p><p>That can extend to your family by hosting international colleagues in your home country and by affording your family the ability to travel with you. Children and adults can benefit from engaging with diverse people from around the world.</p><p>Taking an active part in global development offers numerous advantages for an individual. You can broaden your horizons, gain exposure to diverse markets, and develop a deeper understanding of global consumer needs. The experience can enhance your problem-solving skills and encourage innovative thinking.</p><p>Engineers who navigate the challenges of global product development become more adept at overcoming communication barriers, managing logistical complexities, and adapting to varying consumer preferences.</p><p>Ultimately, active participation in global product development empowers engineers to drive innovation, achieve career growth, and make a meaningful impact in the global marketplace and on society itself.</p>"

The allegation apparently ended his academic career as a professor at the <a href=\"https://eng.pw.edu.pl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Warsaw University of Technology</a> and led to the erasure of his name and work from the school\u2019s records.</p><p>He died in 1953 in obscurity in his hometown of Kcynia.</p><p>The Czochralski method was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/modern-civilization-relies-on-this-crystalgrowing-method\" target=\"_self\">honored in 2019</a> with an <a href=\"https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Main_Page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Milestone</a> for<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/modern-civilization-relies-on-this-crystalgrowing-method\" target=\"_self\"> enabling the </a>development of semiconductor devices and modern electronics.

The initiative, which aims to educate the public about Czochralski\u2019s life and scientific impact, maintains two websites\u2014one in English and the other in Polish.</p><p>\u201cDiscovering the [IEEE Milestone] plaque changed my entire mission,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cIt inspired me to engage with Poland, my family history, and my grandfather\u2019s story [on] a more personal level. The [Milestone] is an important award of validation and recognition. It\u2019s a big part of what I\u2019m building my entire case and my story around as I promote the Jan Czochralski legacy and history to the Western world.\u201d</p><p>Schmidt, who lives in Texas, is seeking to produce a biopic, translate a Polish biography to English, and turn the chemist\u2019s former homes in Kcynia and Warsaw into museums. The Jan Czochralski Remembrance Foundation has been established by Schmidt to help fund the projects.</p><h2>The life of the Polish chemist</h2><p>Before Czochralski\u2019s birth in 1885, Kcynia became part of the German Empire in 1871. Although his family identified as Polish and spoke the language at home, they couldn\u2019t publicly acknowledge their culture, Schmidt says.</p><p>When it came time for Czochralski to go to university, rather than attend one in Warsaw, he did what many Germans did at the time: He attended one in Berlin.</p><p>After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in metal chemistry in 1907 from the K\u00f6niglich Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now <a href=\"https://www.tu.berlin/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin</a>), he joined <a href=\"https://www.aeg-att.com/Home/About\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft</a> in Berlin as an engineer.</p><p>Czochralski experimented with materials to find new formulations that could improve the electrical cables and machinery during the early electrical age, according to a <a href=\"https://edconway.substack.com/p/jan-czochralski-the-forgotten-hero\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Material World </em></em>article</a>.</p><p>While investigating the crystallization rates of metal, Czochralski accidentally dipped his pen into a pot of molten tin instead of an inkwell. A tin filament formed on the pen\u2019s tip\u2014which he found interesting. Through research, he proved that the filament was a single crystal. His discovery prompted him to experiment with the bulk production of semiconductor crystals.</p><p>His paper on what he called the Czochralski method was published in 1918 in the German chemistry journal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitschrift_f%C3%BCr_Physikalische_Chemie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie</em></em></a>, but he never found an application for it. (The method wasn\u2019t used until 1948, when <a href=\"https://www.belllabs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Labs</a> engineers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_K._Teal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Kidd Teal</a> and J.B. Little adapted it to grow single germanium crystals for their semiconductor production, according to <a href=\"https://edconway.substack.com/p/jan-czochralski-the-forgotten-hero\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Material World</em></em></a>.)</p><p>Czochralski continued working in metal science, founding and directing a research laboratory in 1917 at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallgesellschaft\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Metallgesellschaft</a> in Frankfurt. In 1919 he was one of the founding members of the <a href=\"https://dgm.de/en/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">German Society for Metals Science</a>, in Sankt Augustin. He served as its president until 1925.</p><p>Around that time he developed an innovation that led to his wealth and fame, Schmidt says. Called \u201cB-metal,\u201d the metal alloy was a less expensive alternative to the tin used in manufacturing railroad carriage bearings. Czochralski\u2019s alloy was patented by the German railway <a href=\"https://www.deutschebahn.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bahn</a> and played a significant role in advancing rail transport in Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, according to <em><em>Material World</em></em>.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cLaunching this initiative has been fulfilling and personally rewarding work. My grandfather died in obscurity without ever seeing the results of his work, and my mother spent her entire adult life trying to right these wrongs.\u201d</p><p>The achievement brought Czochralski many opportunities. In 1925 he became president of the <a href=\"https://gdmb.de/home/\" target=\"_blank\">GDMB Society of Metallurgists and Miners</a>, in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Ford</a> invited Czochralski to visit his factories and offered him the position of director at Ford\u2019s new aluminum factory in Detroit. Czochralski declined the offer, longing to return to Poland, Schmidt says. Instead, Czochralski left Germany to become a professor of metallurgy and metal research at the <a href=\"https://eng.pw.edu.pl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Warsaw University of Technology</a>, at the invitation of Polish President <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Mo%C5%9Bcicki\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki</a>.</p><p>\u201cDuring World War II, the Nazis took over his laboratories at the university,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cHe had to cooperate with them or die. At night, he and his team [at the university] worked with the Polish resistance and the Polish Army to fight the Nazis.\u201d</p><p>After the war ended, Czochralski was arrested in 1945 and charged with betraying Poland. Although he was able to clear his name, damage was done. He left Warsaw and returned to Kcynia, where he <a href=\"https://www.jancz.org/timeline\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ran a small pharmaceutical business</a> until he died in 1953, according to the JanCZ project.</p><h2>Launching the JanCZ project</h2><p>Schmidt was born in Czochralski\u2019s home in Kcynia in 1955, two years after his grandfather\u2019s death. He was named Klemens Jan Borys Czochralski. He and his mother (Czochralski\u2019s youngest daughter) emigrated in 1958 when Schmidt was 3 years old, moving to Detroit as refugees. When he was 13, he became a U.S. citizen. He changed his name to Fred Schmidt after his mother married his stepfather.</p><p>Schmidt heard stories about his grandfather from his mother his whole life, but he says that \u201cas a teenager, I was just interested in hanging out with my friends, going to school, and working. I really didn\u2019t want much to do with it [family history], because it seemed hard to believe.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait of Jan Czochralski in a suit jacket and tie.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"20b1c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-jan-czochralski-in-a-suit-jacket-and-tie.jpg?id=64092997&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Portrait of Jan Czochralski </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Byla Sobie Fotka</small></p><p>In 2013 Polish scientist <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00OBROQKI/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pawel E. Tomaszewski</a> contacted Schmidt to interview him for a Polish TV documentary about his grandfather.</p><p>\u201cHe had corresponded with my mother [who\u2019d died 20 years earlier] for previously published biographies about Czochralski,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cI had some boxes of her things that I started going through to prepare for the interview, and I found original manuscripts and papers he [his grandfather] published about his work.\u201d</p><p>The TV crew traveled to the United States and interviewed him for the documentary, Schmidt says, adding, \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d ever had to reckon with the Jan Czochralski story, my connection, my original name, and my birthplace. It was both a very cathartic and traumatic experience for me.\u201d</p><p>Ten years after participating in the documentary, Schmidt says, he decided to reconnect with his roots.</p><p>\u201cIt took me that long to process it [what he learned] and figure out my role in this story,\u201d he says. \u201cThat really came to life with my decision to reapply for Polish citizenship, reacquaint myself with the country, and meet my family there.\u201d</p><p>In 2024 he visited the Warsaw University of Technology and saw the IEEE Milestone plaque honoring his grandfather\u2019s contribution to technology.</p><p>\u201cOnce I learned what the Milestone award represented, I thought, Whoa, that\u2019s big,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Sharing the story with the Western world</h2><p>Since 2023, Schmidt has dedicated himself to publicizing his grandfather\u2019s story, primarily in the West because he doesn\u2019t speak Polish. Sylwester Czochralski manages the work in Poland, with Schmidt\u2019s input.</p><p>Most of the available writing about Czochralski is in Polish, Schmidt says, so his goal is to \u201cspread his story to English-speaking countries.\u201d</p><p>He aims to do that, he says, through a biography written by Tomaszewski in Polish that will be translated to English, and a film. The movie is in development by Sywester Banaszkiewicz, who produced and directed the 2014 documentary in Poland. Schmidt says he hopes the movie will be similar to the 2023 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biopic</a> about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped develop the world\u2019s first nuclear weapons during World War II.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://jancz.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">English</a> and <a href=\"https://janczochralski.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Polish</a> versions of the website take visitors through Czochralski\u2019s life and his work. They highlight media coverage of the chemist, including newspaper articles, films, and informational videos posted by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> creators.</p><p>Schmidt is working with the <a href=\"https://kujawsko-pomorskie.pl/en/news/a-chemical-institute-of-the-polish-academy-of-sciences-will-be-established-in-torun/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Czochralski Research and Development Institute</a> in Toru\u0144, Poland, to purchase his grandfather\u2019s home in Kcynia and the mansion he lived in while he was a professor in Warsaw. The institute is a collection of labs and initiatives dedicated to honoring the chemist\u2019s work.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long, fun journey, and we have a lot of momentum,\u201d Schmidt says of his plans to turn the residences into museums.</p><p>\u201cLaunching this initiative has been fulfilling and personally rewarding work,\u201d he says. \u201cMy grandfather died in obscurity without ever seeing the results of his work, and my mother spent her entire adult life trying to right these wrongs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on an accelerated course to make it [her goal] happen to the best of my ability.\u201d</p>"

Researchers are just beginning to understand the nature of these interactions, but one essential question has already emerged: D<span>o AI companions ease our woes or contribute to them?</span></p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\"><span>RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-companion-relationships\" target=\"_blank\">How Do You Define an AI Companion?</a></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/brad-knox\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Knox</a> is a research associate professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who researches human-computer interaction and reinforcement learning. He previously started a company <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/botsalive-brings-sophisticated-brains-to-cheap-robots\" target=\"_self\">making simple robotic pets</a> with lifelike personalities, and in December, Knox and his colleagues at UT Austin published a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14972\" target=\"_blank\">preprint paper on the potential harms</a> of AI companions\u2014AI systems that provide companionship, whether designed to do so or not. </p><p>Knox spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> about the rise of AI companions, their risks, and where they diverge from human relationships.</p><h2>Why AI Companions are Popular</h2><p><strong><span></span>Why are AI companions becoming more popular?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: My sense is that the main thing motivating it is that large language models are not that difficult to adapt into effective chatbot companions. The characteristics that are needed for companionship, a lot of those boxes are checked by large language models, so fine-tuning them to adopt a persona or be a character is not that difficult.</p><p>There was a long period where chatbots and other social robots were not that compelling. I was a postdoc at the MIT Media Lab in <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/people/cynthiab/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Cynthia Breazeal</a>\u2019s group from 2012 to 2014, and I remember our group members didn\u2019t want to interact for long with the robots that we built. The technology just wasn\u2019t there yet. LLMs have made it so that you can have conversations that can feel quite authentic. </p><p><strong>What are the </strong><strong>main benefits and risks of AI companions?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: In the paper we were more focused on harms, but we do spend a whole page on benefits. A big one is improved emotional well-being. Loneliness is a public health issue, and it seems plausible that AI companions could address that <span>through direct interaction with users, potentially</span> with real mental health benefits. They might also help people build social skills. Interacting with an AI companion is much lower stakes than interacting with a human, so you could practice difficult conversations and build confidence. They could also help in more professional forms of mental health support. </p><p>As far as harms, they include worse well-being, reducing people\u2019s connection to the physical world, the burden that their commitment to the AI system causes. And we\u2019ve seen stories where an AI companion seems to have a substantial causal role in the death of humans. </p><p><span>The concept of harm inherently involves causation: Harm is caused by prior conditions. To better understand harm from AI companions, o</span>ur paper is structured around a causal graph, where traits of AI companions are at the center. In the rest of this graph, we discuss common causes of those traits, and then the harmful effects that those traits could cause. There are four traits that we do this detailed structured treatment of, and then another 14 that we discuss briefly. </p><p><strong>Why is it important to establish potential pathways for harm now?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: I\u2019m not a social media researcher, but it seemed like it took a long time for academia to establish a vocabulary about potential harms of social media <span>and to investigate causal evidence for such harms</span>. I feel fairly confident that AI companions are causing some harm and are going to cause harm in the future. They also could have benefits. But the more we can quickly develop a sophisticated understanding of what they are doing to their users, to their users\u2019 relationships, and to society at large, the sooner we can apply that understanding to their design, moving towards more benefit and less harm. </p><p>We have a list of recommendations, but we consider them to be preliminary. The hope is that we\u2019re helping to create an initial map of this space. Much more research is needed. But thinking through potential pathways to harm could sharpen the intuition of both designers and potential users. I suspect that following that intuition could prevent substantial harm, even though we might not yet have rigorous experimental evidence of what causes a harm. </p><h2>The Burden of AI Companions on Users</h2><p><strong>You mentioned that AI companions might become a burden on humans. </strong><strong>Can you say more about that?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: The idea here is that AI companions are digital, so they can in theory persist indefinitely. Some of the ways that human relationships would end might not be designed in, so that brings up this question of, how should AI companions be designed so that relationships can naturally and healthfully end between the humans and the AI companions?</p><p>There are some compelling examples already of this being a challenge for some users. Many come from users of Replika chatbots, which are popular AI companions. Users have reported things like feeling compelled to attend to the needs of their Replika AI companion, whether those are stated by the AI companion or just imagined. <span>On the subreddit r/replika, users have </span>also reported guilt and shame of abandoning their AI companions.</p><p>This burden is exacerbated by some of the design of the AI companions, whether intentional or not. One study found that the AI companions frequently say that they\u2019re afraid of being abandoned or would be hurt by it. They\u2019re expressing these very human fears that plausibly are stoking people\u2019s feeling that they are burdened with a commitment toward the well-being of these digital entities.</p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>here are also cases where the human user will suddenly lose access to a model. Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Brad Knox holding a miniature robotic spider and an equally-sized obstacle marker.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30a63\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/brad-knox-holding-a-miniature-robotic-spider-and-an-equally-sized-obstacle-marker.jpg?id=64092579&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 2017, Brad Knox started a company providing simple robotic pets.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Brad Knox</small></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: That\u2019s another one of the traits we looked at. It\u2019s sort of the opposite of the absence of endpoints for relationships: The AI companion can become unavailable for reasons that don\u2019t fit the normal narrative of a relationship. </p><p>There\u2019s a great <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/technology/robotica-sony-aibo-robotic-dog-mortality.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>New York Times</em></em> video</a> from 2015 about the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/aibo\" target=\"_self\">Sony Aibo</a> robotic dog. Sony had stopped selling them in the mid-2000s, but they still sold parts for the Aibos. Then they stopped making the parts to repair them. This video follows people in Japan giving funerals for their unrepairable Aibos and interviews some of the owners. It\u2019s clear from the interviews that they seem very attached. I don\u2019t think this represents the majority of Aibo owners, but <span>these robots were built on less potent AI methods than exist today</span> and, even then, some percentage of the users became attached to these robot dogs. So this is an issue.</p><p>Potential solutions include having a product-sunsetting plan when you launch an AI companion. That could include buying insurance so that if the companion provider\u2019s support ends somehow, the insurance triggers funding of keeping them running for some amount of time, or committing to open-source them if you can\u2019t maintain them anymore.</p><p><strong>It s</strong><strong>ounds like a lot of the potential points of harm stem from instances where an AI companion diverges from the expectations of human relationships. Is that fair?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that frames everything in the paper. </p><p>We categorize something as harmful if it results in a person being worse off in two different possible alternative worlds: One where there\u2019s just a better-designed AI companion, and the other where the AI companion doesn\u2019t exist at all. And so I think that difference between human interaction and human-AI interaction connects more to that comparison with the world where there\u2019s just no AI companion at all. </p><p>But there are times where it actually seems that we might be able to reduce harm by taking advantage of the fact that these aren\u2019t actually humans. We have a lot of power over their design. Take the concern with them not having natural endpoints. One possible way to handle that would be to create positive narratives for how the relationship\u2019s going to end.</p><p>We use Tamagotchis, the late \u201990s popular virtual pet as an example. In some Tamagotchis, if you take care of the pet, it grows into an adult and partners with another Tamagotchi. Then it leaves you and you get a new one. For people who are emotionally wrapped up in caring for their Tamagotchis, that <span>narrative of maturing into independence is</span> a fairly positive one. </p><p><strong>Embodied companions like desktop devices, robots, or toys are becoming more common. How might that change AI companions? </strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: Robotics at this point is a harder problem than creating a compelling chatbot. So, my sense is that the level of uptake for embodied companions won\u2019t be as high in the coming few years. The embodied AI companions that I\u2019m aware of are mostly toys. </p><p>A potential advantage of an embodied AI companion is that physical location makes it less ever-present. <span>In contrast, screen-based AI companions like chatbots are as present as the screens they live on.</span> So if they\u2019re trained similarly to social media to maximize engagement, they could be very addictive. There\u2019s something appealing, at least in that respect, of having a physical companion that stays roughly where you left it last. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Brad Knox posing with a humanoid and small owl-like robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a5ab9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/brad-knox-posing-with-a-humanoid-and-small-owl-like-robot.jpg?id=64093001&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Knox poses with the Nexi and Dragonbot robots during his postdoc at MIT in 2014.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Paula Aguilera and Jonathan Williams/MIT</small></p><p><strong>Anything else you\u2019d like to mention?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: There are two other traits I <span>think would be worth touching upon</span>. </p><p>Potentially the largest harm right now is related to the trait of high attachment anxiety\u2014basically jealous, needy AI companions. I can understand the desire to make a wide range of different characters<span>\u2014including possessive ones\u2014</span>but I think this is one of the easier issues to fix. When people see this trait in AI companions, I hope they will be quick to call it out as an immoral thing to put in front of people, something that\u2019s going to discourage them from interacting with others. </p><p>Additionally, if an AI comes with limited ability to interact with groups of people, that itself can push its users to interact with people less. If you have a human friend, in general there\u2019s nothing stopping you from having a group interaction. But if your AI companion can\u2019t understand when multiple people are talking to it and it can\u2019t remember different things about different people, then <span>you\u2019ll likely avoid group interaction with your AI companion</span>. <span>To some degree it\u2019s more of a technical challenge outside of the core behavioral AI</span><span>. But this capability is something I think should be really prioritized if we\u2019re going to try to avoid AI companions competing with human relationships.</span></p>"

So how can we understand the bonds that form between humans and chatbots? </p><p><a href=\"https://ischool.syracuse.edu/jaime-banks/#Biography\" target=\"_blank\">Jaime Banks</a> is a professor at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies who researches the interactions between people and technology\u2014in particular, robots and AI. Banks spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> about how people perceive and relate to machines, and the emerging relationships between humans and their machine companions.</p><h2>Defining AI Companionship</h2><p><strong>How do you define AI companionship? </strong></p><p><strong>Jaime Banks</strong>: My definition is evolving as we learn more about these relationships. For now, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18119\" target=\"_blank\">I define it</a> as a connection between a human and a machine that is dyadic, so there\u2019s an exchange between them. It is also sustained over time; a one-off interaction doesn\u2019t count as a relationship. <span>It\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\">positively valenced</a>\u2014w</span>e like being in it. And it is autotelic, meaning we do it for its own sake. So there\u2019s not some extrinsic motivation, it\u2019s not defined by an ability to help us do our jobs or make us money. </p><p>I have recently been challenged by that definition, though, when I was developing an instrument to measure machine companionship. After developing the scale and working to initially validate it, I saw an interesting situation where some people do move toward this autotelic relationship pattern. \u201cI appreciate my AI for what it is and I love it and I don\u2019t want to change it.\u201d It fit all those parts of the definition. But then there seems to be this <em>other</em> relational template that can actually be both appreciating the AI for its own sake, but also engaging it for utilitarian purposes.</p><p>That makes sense when we think about how people come to be in relationships with AI companions. They often don\u2019t go into it purposefully seeking companionship. A lot of people go into using, for instance, ChatGPT for some other purpose and end up finding companionship through the course of those conversations. And we have these AI companion apps like <a href=\"https://replika.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Replika</a> and <a href=\"https://nomi.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Nomi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paradot.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Paradot</a> that are designed for social interaction. But that\u2019s not to say that they couldn\u2019t help you with practical topics. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Professor Jaime Banks programming the motions of a humanoid robot on a desktop computer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"33630\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/professor-jaime-banks-programming-the-motions-of-a-humanoid-robot-on-a-desktop-computer.jpg?id=64070453&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Jaime Banks customizes the software for an embodied AI social humanoid robot.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angela Ryan/Syracuse University</small></p><p><strong>Different models are also programmed to have different</strong><strong> \u201cpersonalities.\u201d How does that contribute to the relationship between humans and AI companions?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: One of our Ph.D. students just finished <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00773\" target=\"_blank\">a project</a> about what happened when <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI demoted GPT-4o</a> and the problems that people encountered, in terms of companionship experiences when the personality of their AI just completely changed. It didn\u2019t have the same depth. It couldn\u2019t remember things in the same way. </p><p>That echoes what we saw a couple years ago with Replika. Because of legal problems, Replika disabled for a period of time the erotic roleplay module and people described their companions as though they had been lobotomized, that they had this relationship and then one day they didn\u2019t anymore. With my project on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075241269688\" target=\"_blank\">the tanking of the soulmate app</a>, many people in their reflection were like, \u201cI\u2019m never trusting AI companies again. I\u2019m only going to have an AI companion if I can run it from my computer so I know that it will always be there.\u201d </p><h2>Benefits and Risks of AI Relationships</h2><p><strong>What are the benefits and risks of these relationships?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: There\u2019s a lot of talk about the risks and a little talk about benefits. But frankly, we are only just on the precipice of starting to have longitudinal data that might allow people to make causal claims. The headlines would have you believe that these are the end of mankind, that they\u2019re going to make you <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chatbot-ai-lawsuit-suicide-teen-artificial-intelligence-9d48adc572100822fdbc3c90d1456bd0\" target=\"_blank\">commit suicide</a> or abandon other humans. But much of those are based on these unfortunate, but uncommon situations. </p><p>Most scholars gave up technological determinism as a perspective a long time ago. In the communication sciences at least, we don\u2019t generally assume that machines <em>make</em> us do something <span>because we have some degree of agency in our interactions with technologies. Yet much of the fretting around potential risks is deterministic\u2014AI companions make people delusional, make them suicidal, make them reject other relationships</span>. A large number of people get real benefits from AI companions. They narrate experiences that are deeply meaningful to them. I think it\u2019s irresponsible of us to discount those lived experiences. </p><p>When we think about concerns linking AI companions to loneliness, we don\u2019t have much data that can support causal claims. <span>Some studies suggest AI companions lead to loneliness, but other work suggests it reduces loneliness, and other work suggests </span>that loneliness is what comes first. Social relatedness is one of our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01\" target=\"_blank\">three intrinsic psychological needs</a>, and if we don\u2019t have that we will seek it out, whether it\u2019s from <a href=\"https://www.wilson.com/en-gb/blog/volleyball/true-story-wilson-volleyball\" target=\"_blank\">a volleyball for a castaway</a>, my dog, or an AI that will allow me to feel connected to something in my world.</p><p>Some people, and <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A6767\" target=\"_blank\">governments</a> for that matter, may move toward a protective stance. For instance, there are problems around what gets done with your intimate data that you hand over to an agent owned and maintained by a company\u2014that\u2019s a very reasonable concern. Dealing with the potential for children to interact, where children don\u2019t always navigate the boundaries between fiction and actuality. There are real, valid concerns. <span>However, </span><span>we need some</span><span> balance in also thinking about what</span><span> people are </span><span>getting from it that\u2019s positive, productive, healthy. </span><span>Scholars need to make sure we\u2019re being cautious about our claims based on our data. And human interactants need to educate themselves. </span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of Professor Jaime Banks aligning her fingers and palm with the hand of a humanoid robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bab58\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-professor-jaime-banks-aligning-her-fingers-and-palm-with-the-hand-of-a-humanoid-robot.jpg?id=64070474&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Jaime Banks holds a mechanical hand.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angela Ryan/Syracuse University</small></p><p><strong>Why do you think that AI companions are becoming more popular now?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: I feel like we had this perfect storm, if you will, of the maturation of large language models and coming out of COVID, where people had been physically and sometimes socially isolated for quite some time. When those conditions converged, we had on our hands a believable social agent at a time when people were seeking social connection. Outside of that, we are increasingly just not nice to one another. So, it\u2019s not entirely surprising that if I just don\u2019t like the people around me, or I feel disconnected, that I would try to find some other outlet for feeling connected.</p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>ore recently there\u2019s been a shift to embodied companions, in desktop devices or other formats beyond chatbots. How does that change the relationship, if it does?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: I\u2019m part of a Facebook group about robotic companions and I watch how people talk, and it almost seems like it crosses this boundary between toy and companion. When you have a companion with a physical body, you are in some ways limited by the abilities of that body, whereas with digital-only AI, you have the ability to explore fantastic things\u2014places that you would never be able to go with another physical entity, fantasy scenarios.</p><p>But in robotics, once we get into a space where there are bodies that are sophisticated, they become very expensive and that means that they are not accessible to a lot of people. That\u2019s what I\u2019m observing in many of these online groups. These toylike bodies are still accessible, but they are also quite limiting. </p><p><strong>Do you have any favorite examples from popular culture to help explain AI companionship, either how it is now or how it could be?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: <span>I really enjoy a lot of the short fiction in <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Clarkesworld</a> magazine, because the stories push me to think about what questions we might need to answer now to be prepared for a future hybrid society. Top of mind are the stories \u201c<a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ritterhoff_03_22/\" target=\"_blank\">Wanting Things</a>,\u201d \u201c<a href=\"https://strangehorizons.com/wordpress/fiction/seven-sexy-cowboy-robots/\" target=\"_blank\">Seven Sexy Cowboy Robots</a>,\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/shoemaker_08_15/\" target=\"_blank\">Today I am Paul</a>.\u201d </span><span>Outside of that, I\u2019ll point to the game </span><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, because t<span>he character Johnny Silverhand </span><span>complicates the norms for what counts as a machine and what counts as companionship.</span></p>"

The IEEE Life Fellow was 97.</p><p>Chari developed a finite element method (FEM) for analyzing nonlinear electromagnetic fields\u2014which is crucial for the design of electric machines. The technique is used to obtain approximate solutions to complex engineering and mathematical problems. It involves dividing a complicated object or system into smaller, more manageable parts, known as <em><em>finite elements</em></em>, according to <a href=\"https://www.fictiv.com/articles/understanding-the-finite-element-method#:~:text=The%20Finite%20Element%20Method%20(FEM,behavior%20of%20these%20individual%20elements.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fictiv</a>.</p><p>As an engineer and technical leader at <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/about-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">General Electric</a> in Niskayuna, N.Y., Chari used the tool to analyze large turbogenerators for end region analysis, starting with 2D and expanding its use over time to quasi-2D and 3D.</p><p>During his 25 years at GE, he established a team that was developing finite element analysis (FEA) tools for a variety of applications across the company. They ranged from small motors to large <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mri\" target=\"_self\">MRI magnets</a>.</p><p>Chari received the 1993 <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-nikola-tesla-award/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Nikola Tesla Award</a> for \u201cpioneering contributions to finite element computations of nonlinear electromagnetic fields for design and analysis of electric machinery.\u201d</p><h2>A career spanning industry and academia</h2><p>Chari attended <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Imperial College London</a> to pursue a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. There he met <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_P._Silvester\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter P. Silvester</a>, a visiting professor of electrical engineering. Silvester, a professor at <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McGill University</a> in Montreal, was a pioneer in understanding numerical analysis of electromagnetic fields.</p><p>After Chari graduated in 1968, he joined Silvester at McGill as a doctoral student, applying FEM to solve electromagnetic field problems. Silvester applied the method to waveguides, while Chari applied it to saturated magnetic fields. </p><p>Chari joined GE in 1970 after earning his Ph.D. in electrical engineering. He climbed the leadership ladder and was a manager of the company\u2019s electromagnetics division when he left in 1995. He joined <a href=\"https://www.rpi.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in Troy, N.Y., as a visiting research and adjunct professor in its electrical, computer, and systems engineering department. Chari taught graduate and undergraduate classes in electric power engineering and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/advice-leading-mentoring-greater-innovation\" target=\"_self\">mentored</a> many master\u2019s and doctoral students. His strength was nurturing young engineers. </p><p>He also conducted research on electric machines and transformers for the <a href=\"https://www.epri.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electric Power Research Institute</a> and the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Energy</a>. </p><p> In 2008 Chari joined <a href=\"https://www.ndt.org/vendor.asp?ObjectID=21373\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magsoft Corp.</a>, in Clifton Park, N.Y., and conducted advanced work on specialized software for the <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Navy</a> until his retirement in 2016.</p><h2>Remembering a friend</h2><p>Chari successfully nominated one of us (Hoole) to be elevated to IEEE Fellow at the age of 40. He helped launch Haran\u2019s career when Chari sent his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to GE hiring managers for a position in its applied superconductivity lab.</p><p>Chari\u2019s commitment to people came from his family background. His father\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Ayyangar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M.A. Ayyangar</a>\u2014was known throughout India as a freedom fighter, mathematician, and eventually the speaker of the Indian Parliament\u2019s lower house under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prime Minister Nehru</a>. Chari\u2019s wife, Padma, was a physician in New York.</p><p>From Chari\u2019s illustrious family, he was at the peak of South India (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamils\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tamil</a>) society.</p><p>Chari would fondly and cheerfully tell us the story behind his name. Around the time of his birth, it was common in Tamil society not to have formal names. He went by the informal \u201chouse name\u201d Kannah (a term of endearment for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Krishna</a>). When it was time for Chari to start school, an auspicious uncle enrolled him. But Chari had no formal name, so the uncle took it upon himself to give him one. He asked Chari if he would like a long or short name, to which he said long. So the uncle named him Madabushi Venkadamachari.</p><p>When Chari moved to North America, he shortened his name to Madabushi V.K.</p><p>He could also laugh at himself.</p><p>A stellar scientist, he also was a role model, guide, and friend to many of us. We thank God for him.</p>"

Over the course of the conversation, she discussed the evolution of assistive technology over 40 years, the urgent need for affordable communication devices, and why the DIY movement matters now more than ever.</span></p><p><em><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum: </em></strong></em><strong>What got you started in assistive technology?</strong></p><p><strong>Therese Willkomm: </strong>I grew up in Wisconsin, where my father had a machine shop and worked on dairy and hog farms. At age 10, I started building and making things. A cousin was in a farm accident and needed modifications to his tractor, which introduced me to welding. In college, I enrolled in vocational rehabilitation and learned about rehab engineering\u2014assistive technology wasn\u2019t coined until 1988 with the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/senate-bill/2561\" target=\"_blank\">Technology-Related Assistance Act</a>. In 1979, <a href=\"https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/gregg-vanderheiden/\" target=\"_blank\">Gregg Vanderheiden</a> came to the University of Wisconsin-Stout and demonstrated creative things with garage door openers and communication devices. I thought, \u201cWow, this would be an awesome career path\u2014designing and fabricating devices and worksite adaptations for people with disabilities to go back to work and live independently.\u201d I haven\u2019t looked back.</p><p><strong>You\u2019ve created over 2,000 assistive technology solutions. What\u2019s your most memorable one?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> A device for castrating pigs with one hand. We figured out a way to design a device that fit on the end of the hog crate that was foot-operated to hold the hind legs of the pig back so the procedure could be done with one hand.</p><h3>Assistive Technology\u2019s Changing Landscape </h3><p><strong>How has assistive technology evolved over the decades?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm: </strong>In the 1980s, we fabricated devices from wood and early electronics. I became a [<a href=\"https://www.resna.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America</a>, a.k.a. RESNA] member in 1985. The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/senate-bill/2561#:~:text=passed%20Senate%2C%20amended)-,Technology%2DRelated%20Assistance%20for%20Individuals%20With%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201988,of%20all%20ages%20with%20disabilities.\" target=\"_blank\">1988 Technology-Related Assistance Act</a> was transformational\u2014all 50 states finally got funding to support assistive technology and needs in rural areas. Back in the \u201880s, we were soldering and making battery interrupters and momentary switches for toys, radios, and music. Gregg was doing some things with communication. There were <a href=\"https://prc-saltillo.com/why-prc-saltillo/history\" target=\"_blank\">Prentke Romich</a> communication devices. Those were some of the first electronic assistive technologies.</p><p>The early 1990s was all about mobile rehab engineering. Senator Bob Dole <a href=\"https://www.eastersealstech.com/2014/08/27/crucial-part-creative-solution/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20grants%20funded,Willkomm%20said.\" target=\"_blank\">gave me a $50,000 grant</a> to fund my first mobile unit. That mobile unit had all my welding equipment, all my fabrication equipment, and I could drive farm to farm, set up outside right in front of the tractor, and fabricate whatever needed to be fabricated. Then, around 1997, there were cuts in the school systems. Mobile units became really expensive to operate. We started to look at more efficient ways of providing assistive technology services. With the Tech Act, we had demonstration sites where people would come and try out different devices. But people had to get in a car, drive to a center, get out, find parking, come into the building\u2014a lot of time was being lost.</p><p>In the 2000s, more challenges with decreased funding. I discovered that with a Honda Accord and those crates you get from Staples, you could have your whole mobile unit in the trunk of your car because of advances in materials. We could make battery interrupters and momentary switches without ever having to solder. We can make switches in 28 seconds, battery interrupters in 18 seconds. When COVID happened, we had to pivot\u2014do more virtual, ship stuff out to people. We were able to serve more individuals during COVID than prior to COVID because nobody had to travel.</p><p><strong>How do you keep costs under five dollars?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> I aim for five dollars or less. I get tons of corrugated plastic donated for free, so we spend no money on that. Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://scapaindustrial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scapa Tape</a>\u2014a very aggressive double-sided foam tape that costs five cents a foot. If you fabricate something and it doesn\u2019t work out, and you have to reposition, you\u2019re out a nickel\u2019s worth of material. Buying Velcro in bulk helps too. Then<a href=\"https://instamorph.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Instamorph</a>\u2014it is non-toxic, biodegradable. You can reheat it, reform it, in five minutes or less up to six times. I\u2019ve created about 132 different devices just using Instamorph. A lot of things I make out of Instamorph don\u2019t necessarily work. I have a bucket, and I reuse that Instamorph. We can get six, seven devices out of reusable Instamorph. That\u2019s how we keep it under five dollars.</p><p><strong>What key legislation impacts assistive technology?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm: </strong>Definitely the Technology-Related Assistance Act. In the school system, however, it only says \u201cDid you <em>consider</em> assistive technology?\u201d So that legislation really needs to be beefed up. The third piece of legislation I worked on was the <a href=\"https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/agrability\" target=\"_blank\">AgrAbility</a> legislation to fund assistive technology consultations and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers. The latest Technology-Related Assistance Act was <a href=\"https://ataporg.org/at-act-info/\" target=\"_blank\">reauthorized in 2022</a>. Not a whole lot of changes\u2014it\u2019s still assistive technology device demonstrations and loans, device reuse, training, technical assistance, information and awareness. The other thing is<a href=\"https://acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> NIDILRR</a>\u2014National Institute on Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research, funded under [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a.k.a. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services\" target=\"_blank\">HHS</a>]. Funding the rehab engineering centers was pretty significant in advancing the field because these were huge, multimillion-dollar centers dedicated to core areas like communication and employment. Now there\u2019s a new one out on artificial intelligence.</p><h3>A Vision for a Better Assistive Tech Future </h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Person wearing a floral-patterned, white shirt and beaded necklace outdoors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1a182\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-wearing-a-floral-patterned-white-shirt-and-beaded-necklace-outdoors.jpg?id=63527474&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">With over 2,000 hacks to improve usability of assistive technologies, veteran DIY maker Therese Willkomm has earned the moniker \u201cthe MacGyver of assistive tech.\u201d </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Therese Willkomm</small></p><p><strong>What deserves more focus in your field?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> The supply-and-demand problem. It all comes down to time and money. We have an elderly population that continues to grow, and a disability population that continues to grow\u2014high demand, high need for assistive technology, yet the resources available to meet that need are limited. A few years back, the <a href=\"https://www.christopherreeve.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation</a> had a competition. I submitted a proposal similar to the <a href=\"https://topmealkitdelivery.com/compare-top/?utm_source=google&amp;keyword=how%20does%20blue%20apron%20work&amp;campaignid=19738344647&amp;adgroupid=147312616278&amp;targetid=kwd-119910014195&amp;device=c&amp;loc_physical=9001648&amp;net_type=g&amp;mt=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19738344647&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACWvR1todciLbxMtVpO1D33ERjChb&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAssfLBhBDEiwAcLpwfhQhzA6bmvh2gvcKuF296EMnhDCD_JjnPyNwHec6UsC5F7V2brgQGhoCabYQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Apron approach</a>. People don\u2019t have supplies at their house. They can\u2019t buy two inches of tape\u2014they have to buy a whole roll. They can\u2019t buy one foot of corrugated plastic\u2014they\u2019ve got to buy an 18-by-24 sheet or wait till it gets donated.</p><p>With my <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58523017-assistive-technology-solutions-in-minutes-book-iii---make-stuff-and-love\" target=\"_blank\">third book</a>, I created solutions with QR codes showing videos on how to make them. I used Christopher Reeve Foundation funding to purchase supplies. With Blue Apron, somebody wants to make dinner and a box arrives with a chicken breast, potato, vegetables, and recipe. I thought, what if we could apply that to assistive technology? Somebody needs something, there\u2019s a solution out there, but they don\u2019t have the money or the time\u2014how can we quickly put it in a box and send it to them? People who attended my workshops didn\u2019t have to spend money on materials or waste time at the store. They\u2019d watch the video and assemble it.</p><p>But then there were people who said, \u201cI do not have even five minutes in the school day to stop what I\u2019m doing to make something.\u201d So we found volunteers who said, \u201cHey, I can make slant boards. I can make switches. I can adapt toys.\u201d You have people who want to build stuff and people who need stuff. If you can deal with the time and money issue, anything\u2019s possible to serve more people and provide more devices.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s your biggest vision for the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> I\u2019m very passionate about communication. December 15 was the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">passage in 1791 of our First Amendment</a>, freedom of speech. Yet people with communication impairments are denied their basic right of freedom of speech because they don\u2019t have an affordable communication device, or it takes too long to program or learn. I just wish we could get better at designing and fabricating affordable communication devices, so everybody is awarded their First Amendment right. It shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s nice to have\u2014it\u2019s something that\u2019s needed to have. When you lose your leg, you\u2019re fitted with a prosthetic device, and insurance covers that. Insurance should also cover communication devices and all the support services needed. With voice recognition and computer-generated voices, there are tremendous opportunities in assistive technology for communication impairments that need to be addressed.</p><p><strong>What should </strong><em><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></strong></em><strong> readers take away from this conversation?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm: </strong>There\u2019s tremendous need for this skill set\u2014working in conjunction with AI and material sciences and the field of assistive technology and rehab engineering. I\u2019d like people to look at opportunities to volunteer their time and also to pursue careers in the field of specialized rehab engineering.</p><p><strong>How are DIY approaches evolving with new technologies?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> What we\u2019re seeing at maker fairs is more people doing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printed-rockets-india-agnikul\" target=\"_blank\">3D printing</a>, switch-access controls, and these five-minute approaches. There has to be a healthy balance between what we can do with or without electronics. If we need something programmed with electronics, absolutely\u2014but is there a faster way?</p><p>The other thing that\u2019s interesting is skill development. You used to have to go to college for four, six, eight years. With YouTube, you can learn so much on the internet. You can develop skills in things you never thought were possible without a four-year degree. There\u2019s basic electronic stuff you can absolutely learn without taking a course. I think we\u2019re going to have more people out there doing hacks, asking \u201cWhat if I change it this way?\u201d We don\u2019t need to have a switch. </p><p>We need to look at the person\u2019s body and how that body interacts with the electronic device interface so it requires minimal effort\u2014whether it be eye control or motion control. Having devices that predict what you\u2019re going to want next, that are constantly listening, knowing the way you talk. I love the fact that AI looks at all my emails and creates this whole thing like \u201cHere\u2019s how I\u2019d respond.\u201d I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s exactly it. I just hit select, and I don\u2019t have to type it all out. It speeds up communication. We\u2019re living in exciting times right now.</p><p><em>This article was supported by the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ieee-foundation\" target=\"_self\">IEEE Foundation</a> and a John C.

And because such diminutive payloads don\u2019t pose a danger to aircraft, they aren\u2019t subject to the many rules and restrictions on free-floating balloons that carry more mass.</p><p>The essential advances that made pico ballooning possible were figuring out how to track a balloon no matter where in the world it might be and how to power such tiny payloads. A lot of folks worked on these challenges and came up with good solutions that aren\u2019t hard or expensive to reproduce.</p><h2>What is WSPR?</h2><p>Amazingly, the global tracking of the balloon\u2019s telemetry is done without satellites. Instead, pico balloonists take advantage of an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amateur-radio\" target=\"_blank\">amateur-radio</a> network called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WSPR</a> (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter), a protocol developed by a rather famous ham-radio enthusiast\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hooton_Taylor_Jr.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr</a>., one of the two scientists awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering binary pulsars.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Major components of a pico balloon payload.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"176da\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/major-components-of-a-pico-balloon-payload.png?id=63339919&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller [top left] is soldered directly to a daughterboard consisting of a high-frequency transmitter and a GPS module [bottom left], which are all powered by solar panels [right].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>WSPR was designed to monitor signal-propagation conditions for different radio bands\u2014useful information if you\u2019re a ham trying to make distant contacts. WSPR can also record low-power balloon-telemetry signals. WSPR is very low bandwidth\u2014less than 10 bits per minute\u2014but it does the job. A worldwide network of radio amateurs receives these WSPR signals and reports them publicly over the internet, which gives picoballoonists a way to track their flights. You need at least a <a href=\"https://www.arrl.org/upgrading-to-a-general-license\" target=\"_blank\">general-class</a> ham-radio license to launch a pico balloon, as one is required to transmit on the bands used for long-distance telemetry.</p><p>The pico balloon payload I chose to build is based on the aptly named US $4 <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi Pico board</a>, with a solder-on daughterboard that contains a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gps\" target=\"_blank\">GPS</a> receiver and transmitter. The folks who developed this daughterboard and associated software (to create what they call the <a href=\"https://traquito.github.io/tracker/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack WSPR Tracker</a>) have done a fantastic job of making their work easy to reproduce.</p><p>You could, in principle, power the Jetpack tracker with batteries, but in practice it would be impossible to keep them warm in the stratosphere, where average temperatures can be as low as \u201351 \u00b0C. Instead, the tracker runs off two lightweight solar modules. At night, it gracefully powers down. When the sun rises high enough in the morning, the tracker powers up and starts transmitting again.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>My first pico balloon made it only halfway across the Atlantic before going silent.</span></p><p>I had five Jetpack boards custom-manufactured in China for just $39. The cost nearly doubled after adding shipping and tariff charges. Still that\u2019s really cheap, even when you add the cost of the Raspberry Pi ($4), <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F28ZWPY6\" target=\"_blank\">the party balloon</a> ($10 for two), the helium ($10 at my local supermarket), and the two <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerFilm-MPT6-75-Module-Flexible-Thin-Film/dp/B002MFGD16\" target=\"_blank\">solar modules</a> ($7 each).</p><p>The biggest sticking point I had with the Jetpack design was the liberties it takes with spurious emissions from its transmitter. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations call for spurious emissions to be at least 43 decibels below the power of the transmitted signal. But my transmitter had strong unwanted emissions at odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency. (That\u2019s because the transmitter is a<a href=\"https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/3/e/a/9/a/Si5351-datasheet.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Si5351A</a> temperature-controlled oscillator, which outputs a square wave, not a sinusoid.) Taking measurements, I could see that the third harmonic at 42 megahertz was only 25 dB quieter than the 14-MHz fundamental of my WSPR signal\u2019s frequency. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A map showing a track from North Carolina in the United States across the Atlantic and the Iberean peninsula to the Mediterranean. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"77213\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-map-showing-a-track-from-north-carolina-in-the-united-states-across-the-atlantic-and-the-iberean-peninsula-to-the-mediterranea.png?id=63339932&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">As of press time, the WSPR network had tracked my balloon from the Eastern United States to the Mediterranean coast. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>In practical terms, this shouldn\u2019t create any noticeable interference, given that this transmitter puts out milliwatts at most and floats miles away from the nearest receiver. Still, I wanted to be fully compliant with FCC regulations, so I added traps to the antenna\u2014simple circuit elements that hams use to allow a single antenna to work on multiple bands by altering how the antenna resonates at different frequencies. Each trap was made of a small inductor (four 5-millimeter-diameter loops of No. 32 magnet wire) in parallel with a 220-picofarad capacitor. I tuned them with the help of a <a href=\"https://nanovna.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NanoVNA</a> signal analyzer by stretching the loops apart slightly. I attached the traps directly to the tracker board, so that they quashed the spurious 42-MHz emissions at the source. That worked well and added only 0.3 grams of weight.</p><p>With my payload complete, I partially filled my balloon with helium. You want the balloon to hold just a little more gas than it takes to lift the payload off the ground. This will give the helium room to expand as the balloon climbs to its final altitude.</p><p>My first pico balloon, launched from a park near my home in North Carolina, made it only halfway across the Atlantic before going silent. My second went up and was never heard from again. The third was indeed the charm. It crossed the Iberian Peninsula and at the time of this writing is somewhere over the Mediterranean at an altitude of nearly 12 kilometers. With any luck, <a href=\"https://traquito.github.io/search/spots/dashboard/?band=20m&amp;channel=104&amp;callsign=N4LVD&amp;dtGte=2026-01-01\" target=\"_blank\">it might go on</a> to orbit the planet.</p><p>I\u2019m a little puzzled about the balloons\u2019 telemetry messages received on the WSPR network, as they have been few and far between. My best guess is that power from the horizontal solar panels I\u2019m using is marginal, with the winter sun being so low in the sky. That\u2019s something I should have thought about before launching the first balloon just 24 hours after the winter solstice!</p><p><em>This article appears in the February 2026 print issue as \u201c<span>Long-Duration Amateur Ballooning</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

Yet behind the celebrations, a troubling pattern has developed: The volunteer community that built this encyclopedia has lately rejected a key innovation designed to serve readers. The same institution founded on the principle of easy and open community collaboration could now be proving unmovable\u2014trapped between the need to adapt and an institutional resistance to change.</span></p><h3>Wikipedia\u2019s Digital Sclerosis</h3><p>Political economist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom\" target=\"_blank\">Elinor Ostrom</a> won the 2009 Nobel Prize in economics for <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/governingcommons0000ostr/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">studying the ways communities successfully manage shared resources</a>\u2014the \u201ccommons.\u201d Wikipedia\u2019s two founders (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy Wales</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Sanger</a>) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">established the internet\u2019s open-source encyclopedia</a> 25 years ago on principles of the commons: Its volunteer editors create and enforce policies, resolve disputes, and shape the encyclopedia\u2019s direction.</p><p>But building around the commons contains a trade-off, Ostrom\u2019s work found. Communities that make collective decisions tend to develop strong institutional identities. And those identities sometimes spawn reflexively conservative impulses.</p><p>Giving users agency over Wikipedia\u2019s rules, as I\u2019ve discovered in some of <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301663933_Wikimedia_movement_governance_the_limits_of_a-hierarchical_organization\" target=\"_blank\">my own studies of Wikipedia</a>, can lead an institution away ultimately from the needs of those the institution serves.</p><p>Wikipedia\u2019s editors have built the largest collaborative knowledge project in human history. But the governance these editors exercise increasingly resists new generations of innovation.</p><p>Paradoxically, Wikipedia\u2019s revolutionarily collaborative structure once put it at the vanguard of innovation on the open internet. But now that same structure may be failing newer generations of readers.</p><h3>Does Wikipedia\u2019s Format Belong to Readers or Editors?</h3><p>There\u2019s a generational disconnect today at the heart of Wikipedia\u2019s current struggles. The encyclopedia\u2019s format remains wedded to the information-dense, text-heavy style of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica\" target=\"_blank\">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>\u2014the very model Wikipedia was designed to replace.</p><p>A Britannica replacement made sense in 2001. One-quarter of a century ago, the average internet user was older and accustomed to reading long-form content.</p><p>However, teens and twentysomethings today are of a very different demographic and have markedly different media consumption habits compared to Wikipedia\u2019s forebears. <a href=\"https://www.gwi.com/blog/gen-z-vs-gen-alpha\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Z and Gen Alpha</a> readers are accustomed to TikTok, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-youtube-era-made-cloud-gaming-possible\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>, and mobile-first visual media. Their impatience for Wikipedia\u2019s impenetrable walls of text, as any parent of kids of this age knows, arguably threatens the future of the internet\u2019s collaborative knowledge clearinghouse.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation knows this, too. <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/11/10/in-the-ai-era-wikipedia-has-never-been-more-valuable/\" target=\"_blank\">Research has shown</a> that many readers today greatly value quick overviews of any article, before the reader considers whether to dive into the article\u2019s full text. </p><p>So last June, the Foundation launched a modest experiment they called \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_Wikimedia_projects#Beginnings_of_generative_AI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Article Summaries</a>.\u201d The summaries consisted of AI-generated, simplified text at the top of complex articles. Summaries were clearly labeled as machine-generated and unverified, and they were available only to mobile users who opted in.</p><p>Even after all these precautions, however, the volunteer editor community barely gave the experiment time to begin. Editors shut down Simple Article Summaries within <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-pilot-after-editors-protest/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a day</a> of its launch.</p><p>The response was fierce. Editors called the experiment a \u201cghastly idea\u201d and warned of \u201cimmediate and irreversible harm\u201d to Wikipedia\u2019s credibility.</p><p>Comments in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_221\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">village pump</a> (a community discussion page) ranged from blunt (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-summaries-after-editor-revolt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yuck\u201d</a>) to alarmed, with contributors raising <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">legitimate concerns</a> about AI hallucinations and the erosion of editorial oversight.</p><h3>Revisiting Wikipedia\u2019s Past Helps Reveal Its Future</h3><p>Last year\u2019s Simple Summaries storm, and sudden silencing, should be considered in light of historical context. Consider three other flashpoints from Wikipedia\u2019s past:</p><p>In 2013, the Foundation launched VisualEditor\u2014a \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d interface meant to make editing easier\u2014as the default for all newcomers. However, the interface often crashed, broke articles, and was so slow that experienced editors fled. After <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor/RFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">protests erupted</a>, a Wikipedia administrator <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2013/09/25/wikipedia_peasants_revolt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">overrode</a> the Foundation\u2019s rollout, returning VisualEditor to an opt-in feature.</p><p>The following year brought <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_Viewer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Media Viewer</a>, which changed how images were displayed. The community voted to disable it. Then, when an administrator implemented that consensus, a Foundation executive reversed the change and threatened to revoke the admin\u2019s privileges. On the German Wikipedia, the Foundation deployed a new \u201csuperprotect\u201d user right to prevent the community from turning off Media Viewer.</p><p>Even proposals that technically won majority support met resistance. In 2011, the Foundation held a referendum on an image filter that would let readers voluntarily hide graphic content. Despite <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_filter_referendum/Sue's_report_to_the_board/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">56 percent support</a>, the feature was shelved after the German Wikipedia community voted 86 percent against it.</p><p>These three controversies from Wikipedia\u2019s past reveal how genuine conversations can achieve\u2014after disagreements and controversy\u2014compromise and evolution of Wikipedia\u2019s features and formats. Reflexive vetoes of new experiments, as the Simple Summaries spat highlighted last summer, is not genuine conversation.</p><p>Supplementing Wikipedia\u2019s Encyclopedia Britannica\u2013style format with a small component that contains AI summaries is not a simple problem with a cut-and-dried answer, though neither were VisualEditor or Media Viewer.</p><p>Why did 2025\u2019s Wikipedia crisis result in immediate clampdown, whereas its internal crises from 2011\u20132014 found more community-based debates involving discussions and plebiscites? Is Wikipedia\u2019s global readership today witnessing the first signs of a dangerous generation gap?</p><h3>Wikipedia Needs to Air Its Sustainability Crisis</h3><p>A still deeper crisis haunts the online encyclopedia: the sustainability of unpaid labor. Wikipedia was built by volunteers who found meaning in collective knowledge creation. That model worked brilliantly when a generation of internet enthusiasts had time, energy, and idealism to spare. But the volunteer base is aging. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2010 study</a> found the average Wikipedia contributor was in their mid-twenties; today, many of those same editors are now in their forties or fifties.</p><p>Meanwhile, the tech industry has discovered how to extract billions in value from their work. AI companies train their large language models on Wikipedia\u2019s corpus. The <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/11/10/in-the-ai-era-wikipedia-has-never-been-more-valuable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Foundation recently noted</a> it remains one of the highest-quality datasets in the world for AI development. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Research confirms</a> that when developers try to omit Wikipedia from training data, their models produce answers that are less accurate, less diverse, and less verifiable.</p><p>The irony is stark. AI systems deliver answers derived from Wikipedia without sending users back to the source. Google\u2019s AI Overviews, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-checking-sucks\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a>, and countless other tools have learned from Wikipedia\u2019s volunteer-created content\u2014then present that knowledge in ways that break the virtuous cycle Wikipedia depends on. Fewer readers visit the encyclopedia directly. Fewer visitors become editors. Fewer users donate. The pipeline that sustained Wikipedia for a quarter century is breaking down.</p><h3>What Does Wikipedia\u2019s Next 25 Years Look Like?</h3><p>The Simple Summaries situation arguably risks making the encyclopedia increasingly irrelevant to younger generations of readers. And they\u2019ll be relying on Wikipedia\u2019s information commons for the longest time frame of any cohort now editing or reading it.</p><p>On the other hand, a larger mandate does, of course, remain at Wikipedia to serve as stewards of the information commons.

The cost concerns stem from estimates that electricity use in the United States is projected to increase 32 percent by 2030,  mostly from data centers, according to the latest <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies-National-Load-Growth-Report-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>forecast</span></a> from Grid Strategies.</p><p>The solar and storage industries are welcoming these demand projections.

Companies in this sector say they are continuing to emphasize geothermal as a baseload power source\u2014something that can crank out electricity 24/7, like fossil fuels can.

In its pitch to investors, Fervo includes talking points about how next-generation geothermal uses drilling technology from the oil and gas industry. But clean energy isn\u2019t completely missing from Fervo\u2019s communications. \u201cSome sides of the aisle like parts of it, and other parts of the aisle like other parts of it,\u201d Jewett says.</p><p>Like geothermal, nuclear power has enjoyed support from both political parties in the United States. It too is now focusing on touting its ability to meet rising electricity demand, albeit through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/three-mile-island\" target=\"_self\"><span>restarting of decommissioned reactors</span></a>, the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\" target=\"_self\"><span>building of massive new plants</span></a>, and experimentation with advanced solutions such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states\" target=\"_self\"><span>small modular reactors</span></a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/microreactor\" target=\"_self\"><span>microreactors</span></a>.</p><h2> Countries Adopt \u2018Energy Addition\u2019 Tack</h2><p>It\u2019s not just U.S. companies that are shifting the message. In November at ADIPEC, the world\u2019s largest annual energy conference, held in Abu Dhabi, widely adopted buzzwords such as \u201cenergy transition\u201d\u2014a term referring to the shift away from fossil fuels\u2014were being swapped with \u201cenergy addition.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not solely a result in shifting political tides. The surge in energy demand may indeed necessitate more of an addition<span>, rather than a complete transition</span>. It\u2019s a reasonable shift, given the \u201chockey stick\u201d demand increase the industry is facing, says Taff at Sage. \u201cEnergy transition was, in my opinion, when [demand] uptick was very steady. But now that you\u2019ve got the hockey stick, the use of \u2018addition\u2019\u2026is much more applicable,\u201d she says.</p><p>Abroad, <span>Trump\u2019s impact reverberates,  </span> Furfari says. \u201cWe were shy to mention fossil fuel. Mr. Trump does not care, and says, \u2018No, we need fossil fuel.\u2019 This is changing the world.\u201d</p>"

Brian will be sharing his advice on engineering careers with you in the coming weeks of Career Alert.</span></p><p>Here\u2019s a note from Brian: </p><p>\u201c12 years ago, I learned to code at the age of 30. Since then I\u2019ve led engineering teams, worked at organizations ranging from five-person startups to Fortune 500 companies, and taught hundreds of others who want to break into tech. I write for engineers who want practical ways to get better at what they do and advance in their careers. I hope you find what I write helpful.\u201d</p><h1>Technical Interviews in the Age of AI Tools</h1><p>Last year, I was conducting interviews for an AI startup position. We allowed unlimited AI usage during the technical challenge round. Candidates could use Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or any assistant they normally worked with. We wanted to see how they used modern tools.</p><p>During one interview, we asked a candidate a simple question: \u201cCan you explain what the first line of your solution is doing?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>After a long pause, he admitted he had no idea. His solution was correct. The code worked. But he couldn\u2019t explain how or why. This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Around 20 percent of the candidates we interviewed were unable to explain how their solutions worked, only that they did.</p><h2>When AI Makes Interviews Harder</h2><p>A few months earlier, I was on the other side of the table at this same company. During a live interview, I instinctively switched from my AI-enabled code editor to my regular one. The CTO stopped me.</p><p>\u201cJust use whatever you normally would. We want to see how you work with AI.\u201d</p><p>I thought the interview would be easy. But I was wrong.</p><p>Instead of only evaluating correctness, the interviewer focused on my decision-making process:</p><ul><li>Why did I accept certain suggestions?</li><li>Why did I reject others?</li><li>How did I decide when AI helped versus when it created more work?</li></ul><p>I wasn\u2019t just solving a problem in front of strangers. I was explaining my judgment and defending my decisions in real time, and AI created more surface area for judgment. Counterintuitively, the interview was harder.</p><h2>The Shift in Interview Evaluation</h2><p>Most engineers now use AI tools in some form, whether they write code, analyze data, design systems, or automate workflows. AI can generate output quickly, but it can\u2019t explain intent, constraints, or tradeoffs. </p><p>More importantly, it can\u2019t take responsibility when something breaks.</p><p>As a result, major companies and startups alike are now adapting to this reality by shifting to interviews with AI. Meta, Rippling, and Google, for instance, have all begun allowing candidates to use AI assistants in technical sessions. And the goal has evolved: interviewers want to understand how you evaluate, modify, and trust AI-generated answers. </p><p>So, how can you succeed in these interviews?</p><h2>What Actually Matters in AI-Enabled Interviews</h2><p><strong>Refusing to use AI out of principle doesn\u2019t help.</strong> Some candidates avoid AI to prove they can think independently. This can backfire. If the organization uses AI internally\u2014and most do\u2014then refusing to use it signals rigidity, not strength.</p><p><strong>Silence is a red flag.</strong> Interviews aren\u2019t natural working environments. We don\u2019t usually think aloud when deep in a complex problem, but silence can raise concerns. If you\u2019re using AI, explain what you\u2019re doing and why:</p><ul><li>\u201cI\u2019m using AI to sketch an approach, then validating assumptions.\u201d</li><li>\u201cThis suggestion works, but it ignores a constraint we care about.\u201d</li><li>\u201cI\u2019ll accept this part, but I want to simplify it.\u201d</li></ul><p>Your decision-making process is what separates effective engineers from prompt jockeys.</p><p><strong>Treat AI output as a first draft.</strong> Blind acceptance is the fastest way to fail. Strong candidates immediately evaluate the output: Does this meet the requirements? Is it unnecessarily complex? Would I stand behind this in production?</p><p>Small changes like renaming variables, removing abstractions, or tightening logic signal ownership and critical thinking.</p><p><strong>Optimize for trust, not completion.</strong> Most AI tools can complete a coding challenge faster than any human. Interviews that allow AI are testing something different. They\u2019re answering: \u201cWould I trust this person to make good decisions when things get messy?\u201d</p><h2>Adapting to a Shifting Landscape</h2><p>Interviews are changing faster than most candidates realize. Here\u2019s how to prepare:</p><p><strong>Start using AI tools daily.</strong> If you\u2019re not already working with Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or CoPilot, start now. Build muscle memory for prompting, evaluating output, and catching errors.</p><p><strong>Develop your rejection instincts.</strong> The skill isn\u2019t using AI. It\u2019s knowing when AI output is wrong, incomplete, or unnecessarily complex. Practice spotting these issues and learning known pitfalls.</p><p>Your next interview might test these skills. The candidates who\u2019ve been practicing will have a clear advantage.</p><p>\u2014Brian</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/2025-year-of-ai-agents\" target=\"_self\">Was 2025 Really the Year of AI Agents?</a></h2><p>Around this time last year, CEOs like Sam Altman promised that 2025 would be the year AI agents would join the workforce as your own personal assistant. But in hindsight, did that really happen? It depends on who you ask. Some programmers and software engineers have embraced agents like Cursor and Claude Code in their daily work.

And nowhere is that more true than in the market for computer memory. Demand, and profitability, for the type of DRAM used to feed GPUs and other accelerators in AI data centers is so huge that it\u2019s diverting away supply of memory for other uses and causing prices to skyrocket. According to <a href=\"https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/Memory-Prices-Surge-Up-to-90-From-Q4-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Counterpoint Research</a>, DRAM prices have risen 80-90 precent so far this quarter.</span></p><p>The largest AI hardware companies say they have secured their chips out as far as 2028, but that leaves everybody else\u2014makers of PCs, consumer gizmos, and everything else that needs to temporarily store a billion bits\u2014scrambling to deal with scarce supply and inflated prices.</p><p>How did the electronics industry get into this mess, and more importantly, how will it get out? <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> asked economists and memory experts to explain. They say today\u2019s situation is the result of a collision between the DRAM industry\u2019s historic boom and bust cycle and an AI hardware infrastructure build-out that\u2019s without precedent in its scale. And, barring some major collapse in the AI sector, it will take years for new capacity and new technology to bring supply in line with demand. Prices might stay high even then.</p><p>To understand both ends of the tale, you need to know the main culprit in the supply and demand swing, high-bandwidth memory, or HBM.</p><h2>What is HBM?</h2><p>HBM is the DRAM industry\u2019s attempt to short-circuit the slowing pace of Moore\u2019s Law by using 3D chip packaging technology. Each HBM chip is made up of as many as 12 thinned-down DRAM chips called dies. Each die contains a number of vertical connections called through silicon vias (TSVs). The dies are piled atop each other and connected by arrays of microscopic solder balls aligned to the TSVs. This DRAM tower\u2014well, at about 750 micrometers thick, it\u2019s more of a brutalist office-block than a tower\u2014is then stacked atop what\u2019s called the base die, which shuttles bits between the memory dies and the processor.</p><p>This complex piece of technology is then set within a millimeter of a GPU or other AI accelerator, to which it is linked by as many as 2,048 micrometer-scale connections. HBMs are attached on two sides of the processor, and the GPU and memory are packaged together as a single unit.</p><p>The idea behind such a tight, highly-connected squeeze with the GPU is to knock down what\u2019s called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-and-memory-wall\" target=\"_self\">the memory wall</a>. That\u2019s the barrier in energy and time of bringing the terabytes per second of data needed to run large language models into the GPU. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-models-locally\" target=\"_self\">Memory bandwidth</a> is a key limiter to how fast LLMs can run.</p><p>As a technology, HBM has been around for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chipmakers-push-memory-into-the-third-dimension\" target=\"_self\">more than 10 years</a>, and DRAM makers have been busy boosting its capability.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27466742/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p>As the size of AI models has grown, so has HBM\u2019s importance to the GPU. But that\u2019s come at a cost. <a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/scaling-the-memory-wall-the-rise-and-roadmap-of-hbm\" target=\"_blank\">SemiAnalysis estimates</a><strong> </strong>that HBM generally costs three times as much as other types of memory and constitutes 50 percent or more of the cost of the packaged GPU.</p><h2>Origins of the memory chip shortage</h2><p>Memory and storage industry watchers agree that DRAM is a highly cyclical industry with huge booms and devastating busts. With new fabs costing US $15 billion or more, firms are extremely reluctant to expand and may only have the cash to do so during boom times, explains <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-coughlin-41a65/\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Coughlin</a>, a storage and memory expert and president of <a href=\"https://tomcoughlin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Coughlin Associates</a>. But building such a fab and getting it up and running can take 18 months or more, practically ensuring that new capacity arrives well past the initial surge in demand, flooding the market and depressing prices.</p><p>The origins of today\u2019s cycle, says Coughlin, go all the way back to the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-shortage\" target=\"_self\">chip supply panic surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic</a> . To avoid supply-chain stumbles and support the rapid shift to remote work, hyperscalers\u2014data center giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft\u2014bought up huge inventories of memory and storage, boosting prices, he notes.</p><p>But then supply became more regular and data center expansion fell off in 2022, causing memory and storage prices to plummet. This recession continued into 2023, and even resulted in big memory and storage companies such as Samsung cutting production by 50 percent to try and keep prices from going below the costs of manufacturing, says Coughlin. It was a rare and fairly desperate move, because companies typically have to run plants at full capacity just to earn back their value.<span></span></p><p>After a recovery began in late 2023, \u201call the memory and storage companies were very wary of increasing their production capacity again,\u201d says Coughlin. \u201cThus there was little or no investment in new production capacity in 2024 and through most of 2025.\u201d</p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27468004/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><h2>The AI data center boom</h2><p>That lack of new investment is colliding headlong with a huge boost in demand from new data centers. Globally, there are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-growth\" target=\"_self\">nearly 2,000 new data centers</a> either planned or under construction right now, according to Data Center Map. If they\u2019re all built, it would represent a 20 percent jump in the global supply, which stands at around 9,000 facilities now.</p><p>If the current build-out continues at pace, McKinsey predicts companies will spend <a href=\"https://programs.com/resources/data-center-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">$7 trillion by 2030</a>, with the bulk of that\u2014$5.2 trillion\u2014going to AI-focused data centers. Of that chunk, $3.3 billion will go toward servers, data storage, and network equipment, the firm predicts.</p><p>The biggest beneficiary so far of the AI data center boom is unquestionably GPU-maker Nvidia. Revenue for its data center business went from <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/nvidia_corp_nvda_data_center_revenue_quarterly\" target=\"_blank\">barely a billion in the final quarter of 2019 to $51 billion in the quarter that ended in October 2025</a>. Over this period, its server GPUs have demanded not just more and more gigabytes of DRAM but an increasing number of DRAM chips. The recently released B300 uses eight HBM chips, each of which is a stack of 12 DRAM dies. Competitors\u2019 use of HBM has largely mirrored Nvidia\u2019s. AMD\u2019s MI350 GPU, for example, also uses eight, 12-die chips.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27459660/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p>With so much demand, an increasing fraction of the revenue for DRAM makers comes from HBM. Micron\u2014the number three producer behind SK Hynix and Samsung\u2014reported that <a href=\"https://investors.micron.com/static-files/8791eb80-8263-4c6f-aa74-fdd03fbbb027\" target=\"_blank\">HBM and other cloud-related memory</a> went from being 17 percent of its DRAM revenue in 2023 to nearly 50 percent in 2025.</p><p>Micron predicts the total market for HBM will grow from $35 billion in 2025 to $100 billion by 2028\u2014a figure larger than the entire DRAM market in 2024, CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjay-mehrotra/\" target=\"_blank\">Sanjay Mehrotra</a> <a href=\"https://investors.micron.com/static-files/088991c5-a249-4f66-a0a6-258d9b66f3f9\" target=\"_blank\">told analysts in December</a>. It\u2019s reaching that figure two years earlier than Micron had previously expected. Across the industry, demand will outstrip supply \u201csubstantially\u2026 for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27481588/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><h2>Future DRAM supply and technology</h2><p>\u201cThere are two ways to address supply issues with DRAM: with innovation or with building more fabs,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mina-kim-37449b/\" target=\"_blank\">Mina Kim</a>, an economist with the Mkecon Insights. \u201cAs <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/micron-dram\" target=\"_self\">DRAM scaling</a> has become more difficult, the industry has turned to advanced packaging\u2026 which is just using more DRAM.\u201d</p><p>Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix combined make up the vast majority of the memory and storage markets, and all three have new fabs and facilities in the works. However, these are unlikely to contribute meaningfully to bringing down prices.</p><p><strong>Micron</strong> is in the process of <a href=\"https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-breaks-ground-advanced-wafer-fabrication-facility\" target=\"_blank\">building an HBM fab</a> in Singapore that should be in production in 2027.

Last month, Micron <a href=\"https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-celebrates-official-groundbreaking-new-york-megafab-site\" target=\"_blank\">broke ground</a> on what will be a DRAM fab complex in Onondaga County, N.Y. It will not be in full production until 2030.</p><p><strong>Samsung</strong> plans to <a href=\"https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/11/16/U5VKNZCSYBCONMRCXDZ45MCIXQ/\" target=\"_blank\">start producing</a> at a new plant in Pyeongtaek, South Korea in 2028.</p><p><strong>SK Hynix</strong> is building <a href=\"https://www.skhynix.com/westlafayette.IN/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HBM and packaging</a> facilities in West Lafayette, Indiana set to begin production by the end of 2028, and an HBM fab it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/13/sk-hynix-invest-13-billion-new-fab-memory-chip-shortage-advanced-packaging-ai-memory.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">building in Cheongju</a> should be complete in 2027.</p><p>Speaking of his sense of the DRAM market, <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/lip-bu-tan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan</a><strong> </strong>told attendees at the <a href=\"https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2026/m02/ai-summit.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco AI Summit</a> last week: \u201cThere\u2019s no relief until 2028.\u201d</p><p>With these expansions unable to contribute for several years, other factors will be needed to increase supply. \u201cRelief will come from a combination of incremental capacity expansions by existing DRAM leaders, yield improvements in advanced packaging, and a broader diversification of supply chains,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.electronics.org/meet-shawn-dubravac-ipcs-chief-economist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shawn DuBravac</a> , chief economist for the <a href=\"https://www.electronics.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Global Electronics Association</a> (formerly the IPC). \u201cNew fabs will help at the margin, but the faster gains will come from process learning, better [DRAM] stacking efficiency, and tighter coordination between memory suppliers and AI chip designers.\u201d</p><p>So, will prices come down once some of these new plants come on line? Don\u2019t bet on it. \u201cIn general, economists find that prices come down much more slowly and reluctantly than they go up. DRAM today is unlikely to be an exception to this general observation, especially given the insatiable demand for compute,\u201d says Kim.</p><p>In the meantime, technologies are in the works that could make HBM an even bigger consumer of silicon. The standard for HBM4 can accommodate 16 stacked DRAM dies, even though today\u2019s chips only use 12 dies. Getting to 16 has a lot to do with the chip stacking technology. Conducting heat through the HBM \u201clayer cake\u201d of silicon, solder, and support material is a key limiter to going higher and in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hbm-on-gpu-imec-iedm\" target=\"_self\">repositioning HBM inside the package</a> to get even more bandwidth.</p><p>SK Hynix claims a heat conduction advantage through a manufacturing process called advanced <a href=\"https://news.skhynix.com/rulebreaker-revolutions-mr-muf-unlocks-hbm-heat-control/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MR-MUF (mass reflow molded underfill)</a>. Further out, an alternative chip stacking technology called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_self\">hybrid bonding</a> could help heat conduction by reducing the die-to-die vertical distance essentially to zero. In 2024, researchers at Samsung proved they could produce a 16-high stack with hybrid bonding, and they suggested that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_self\">20 dies was not out of reach</a>.</p>"
