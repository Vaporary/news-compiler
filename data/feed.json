        "summary": "T\u00fcrkiye's response to post-pandemic inflation is a cautionary tale of how political pressure for low interest rates can create macroeconomic instabilities. While central banks worldwide raised interest rates to combat inflation in 2021-2023, Turkish authorities pursued the opposite strategy: cutting real rates to deeply negative levels while implementing financial engineering tools, FX interventions, and financial repression to stabilize markets. The centerpiece was a novel FX-protected deposit scheme (KKM) that guaranteed depositors against currency depreciation, shifting exchange rate risk to the government balance sheet. We provide a detailed account of this policy experiment and develop a theoretical model focusing on how KKM functions and creates vulnerabilities. Our model reveals that pressure to keep interest rates below inflation-targeting levels can lead to an interconnected destabilizing sequence. Low rates generate inflation, current account deficits, and exchange rate depreciation. KKM provides partial stabilization by effectively raising rates for savers while maintaining low rates for borrowers. However, this creates growing contingent fiscal burdens and vulnerability to self-fulfilling currency and sovereign debt crises. This explains additional policies adopted including capital flow management, financial repression, and return to orthodox monetary policy. As central banks worldwide face renewed pressure to set lower policy rates, T\u00fcrkiye's experience illustrates the consequences."

We use a 2019 state-contingent survey of 11,000 Danish women linked to administrative data to compare pre-birth beliefs to realized outcomes. Mothers accurately anticipate their eventual return to work but underestimate the duration of the career interruption. This miscalibration stems from two belief errors\u2014about partner leave and own labor supply\u2014which interact and persist even among second-time mothers, with implications for labor supply, planning, and policy design."

In a quantitative model calibrated to the US economy featuring both cross-state migration and risk-free savings, we find that the constrained-efficient allocation features lower population but higher average consumption in less productive states than the status quo, achieving efficiency and spatial redistribution simultaneously through dynamic incentives. In response to local negative productivity shocks, the constrained-efficient allocation features more front-loaded consumption than the status quo, with systematic heterogeneity linked to the location\u2019s pre-shock fundamentals."

Based on a database of over 150 million resumes, this metric exploits the variation in how long it takes workers to attain job titles. A person\u2019s seniority is defined as the number of years it takes the median individual\u2014within the same industry and firm size category\u2014to achieve that person\u2019s job title. Seniority aligns with standard markers of success\u2014it is positively correlated with both wages and educational attainment. To demonstrate its value as a measure of career progression, we show that individuals with higher seniority levels in the public sector are more likely to transition to higher-paying positions in the private sector. When non-monetary factors influence career choice, evaluating labor market outcomes using non-wage measures, such as seniority, offers significant advantages."

Using individual-level administrative data from the universe of civil domestic violence cases in Puerto Rico during the period 2014-2020, we leverage the staggered opening of SDVCs across judicial regions to examine the consequences for victims\u2019 judicial protection and offender recidivism. Access to SDVCs leads to a considerable 8 percentage points increase in the probability that judges issue a protection order and a 1.7 percentage point (15 percent) decrease in victim and offender reappearance rates within one year of the start of the case. Effects are more pronounced for cases in which parties have children in common and in which access to SDVCs is more limited. Linking the case data to administrative and survey data on judges, we show that the priorities of judges assigned to SDVCs play a prominent role in explaining these outcomes."

Self-image concerns lead individuals to process information and make choices in non-standard ways that help affirm and protect certain valued identities. We first present the main cognitive mechanisms involved within a simple unifying framework. We then survey the extensive laboratory, online, and field experimental literature on the nature and behavioral implications of self-image concerns. We discuss in particular how they give rise to information and decision avoidance, motivated memory and beliefs, excuse-driven behavior, preferences for truth-telling, hypothetical bias, moral cleansing and moral licensing, collective identities, political preferences, and other forms of self-signaling or self-deception. We subsequently discuss common empirical strategies used to identify self-image concerns, as well as the threats to their validity and how to alleviate them. We conclude by outlining open questions and directions for future research on the belief-based approach to identity."

Using millions of job applications on an online job platform and the staggered extension of maternity leave across Chinese provinces, we find that an average increase (22%) in the length of paid maternity leave led to a 3.7 percentage point decrease in positive callbacks to female applicants relative to their male counterparts. In response, female job seekers submitted 4.4 more job applications, shifted toward jobs with 5.4% lower wages, and experienced 0.9 weeks longer job search duration than male applicants. We also find that government subsidies that partially cover firms' wage costs of extended maternity leave help alleviate its adverse impact on gender disparities in hiring."

The long-term vision is for iRonCub (or a robot like it) to operate as a disaster response platform, Pucci tells us. In an emergency situation like a flood or a fire, iRonCub could quickly get to a location without worrying about obstacles, and then on landing, start walking for energy efficiency while using its arms and hands to move debris and open doors. \u201cWe believe in contributing to something unique in the future,\u201d says Pucci. \u201cWe have to explore new things, and this is wild territory at the scientific level.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, this concept for iRonCub and the practical experimentation attached to it is really cool. But coolness in of itself is usually not enough of a reason to build a robot, especially a robot that\u2019s a (presumably rather expensive) multi-year project involving a bunch of robotics students, so let\u2019s get into a little more detail about why a flying robot baby is actually something that the world needs.</p><hr /> <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In an emergency situation like a flood or a fire, iRonCub could quickly get to a location without worrying about obstacles, and then on landing, start walking for energy efficiency while using its arms and hands to move debris and open doors.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">IIT</small> </p><p><span>Getting a humanoid robot to do this sort of thing is quite a challenge. Together, the jet turbines mounted to iRonCub\u2019s back and arms can generate over 1000 N of thrust, but because it takes time for the engines to spool up or down, control has to come from the robot itself as it moves its arm-engines to maintain stability. </span></p><p><span>\u201cWhat is not visible from the video,\u201d Pucci tells us, \u201cis that the exhaust gas from the turbines is at 800 degrees Celsius and almost supersonic speed. We have to understand how to generate trajectories in order to avoid the fact that the cones of emission gasses were impacting the robot.\u201d </span></p><p><span>Even if the exhaust doesn\u2019t end up melting the robot, there are still aerodynamic forces involved that have until this point really not been a consideration for humanoid robots at all\u2014in June, Pucci\u2019s group </span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00447-w\" target=\"_blank\">published a paper in <em>Nature Engineering Communications</em></a><span>, offering a \u201ccomprehensive approach to model and control aerodynamic forces [for humanoid robots] using classical and learning techniques.\u201d</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cThe exhaust gas from the turbines is at 800 degrees Celsius and almost supersonic speed.\u201d <strong>\u2014Daniele Pucci, IIT</strong> </span></p><p>Whether or not you\u2019re on board with Pucci\u2019s future vision for iRonCub as a disaster response platform, derivatives of current research can be immediately applied beyond flying humanoid robots. The algorithms for thrust estimation can be used with other flying platforms that rely on directed thrust, like eVTOL aircraft. Aerodynamic compensation is relevant for humanoid robots even if they\u2019re not airborne, if we expect them to be able to function when it\u2019s windy outside.</p><p>More surprising, Pucci describes a recent collaboration with an industrial company developing a new pneumatic gripper. \u201cAt a certain point, we had to do force estimation for controlling the gripper, and we realized that the dynamics looked really similar to those of the jet turbines, and so we were able to use the same tools for gripper control. That was an \u2018ah-ha\u2019 moment for us: first you do something crazy, but then you build the tools and methods, and then you can actually use those tools in an industrial scenario. That\u2019s how to drive innovation.\u201d</p><h2>What\u2019s Next for iRonCub: Attracting Talent and Future Enhancements</h2><p>There\u2019s one more important reason to be doing this, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s really cool.\u201d In practice, a really cool flagship project like iRonCub not only attracts talent to Pucci\u2019s lab, but also keeps students and researchers passionate and engaged. I saw this firsthand when I visited IIT last year, where I got a similar vibe to watching the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/darpa-robotics-challenge-amazing-moments-lessons-learned-whats-next\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA Robotics Challenge</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/darpa-subterranean-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA SubT</a>\u2014when people know they\u2019re working on something <em><em>really cool</em></em>, there\u2019s this tangible, pervasive, and immersive buzzing excitement that comes through. It\u2019s projects like iRonCub that can get students to really love robotics.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the near future, a new jetpack with an added degree of freedom will make yaw control of iRonCub easier, and Pucci would also like to add wings for more efficient long distance flight. But the logistics of testing the robot are getting more complicated\u2014there\u2019s only so far that the team can go with their current test stand (which is on the roof of their building), and future progress will likely require coordinating with the Genoa airport. </p><p>It\u2019s not going to be easy, but as Pucci makes clear, \u201cthis is not a joke. It\u2019s something that we believe in. And that feeling of doing something exceptional, or possibly historical, something that\u2019s going to be remembered\u2014that\u2019s something that\u2019s kept us motivated. And we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p>"

Ask someone in AI for their timeline, and they\u2019ll tell you when they expect the arrival of AGI\u2014artificial general intelligence\u2014which is sometimes defined as AI technology that can match the abilities of humans at most tasks. As AI\u2019s sophistication has scaled\u2014thanks to faster computers, better algorithms, and more data\u2014timelines have compressed. The leaders of major AI labs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind, have recently said they expect AGI within a few years.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>A computer system that thinks like us would enable close collaboration. Both the immediate and long-term impacts of AGI, if achieved, are unclear, but expect to see changes in the economy, scientific discovery, and geopolitics. And if AGI leads to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/can-we-stop-the-singularity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">superintelligence</a>, it may even affect humanity\u2019s placement in the predatory pecking order. So it\u2019s imperative that we track the technology\u2019s progress in preparation for such disruption. Benchmarking AI\u2019s capabilities allows us to shape legal regulations, engineering goals, social norms, and business models\u2014and to understand intelligence more broadly.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/computers-ace-iq-tests-still-make-dumb-mistakes-can-different-tests-help\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarking</a> any intellectual ability is tough, doing so for AGI presents special challenges. That\u2019s in part because people strongly disagree on its definition: Some define AGI by its performance on benchmarks, others by its internal workings, its economic impact, or vibes. So the first step toward measuring the intelligence of AI is agreeing on the general concept.</p><h3></h3><br /><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/arc-prize-agi-test\" target=\"_blank\">Are You Smarter Than an AI?</a></h2><p>Play a version of the game that researchers are using to track AI\u2019s progress toward artificial general intelligence.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Another issue is that AI systems have different strengths and weaknesses from humans, so even if we define AGI as \u201cAI that can match humans at most tasks,\u201d we can debate which tasks really count, and which humans set the standard. Direct comparisons are difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re building alien beings,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/hinton/facts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">won a Nobel Prize</a> for his work on AI.</p><p>Undaunted researchers are busy designing and proposing tests that might lend some insight into our future. But a question remains: Can these tests tell us if we\u2019ve achieved the long-sought goal of AGI?</p><h2>Why It\u2019s So Hard to Test for Intelligence</h2><p>There are infinite kinds of intelligence, even in humans. IQ tests provide a kind of summary statistic by including a range of semirelated tasks involving memory, logic, spatial processing, mathematics, and vocabulary. Sliced differently, performance on each task relies on a mixture of what\u2019s called <em>fluid</em> intelligence\u2014reasoning on the fly\u2014and <em>crystallized</em> intelligence\u2014applying learned knowledge or skills.</p><p>For humans in high-income countries, IQ tests often predict key outcomes, such as academic and career success. But we can\u2019t make the same assumptions about AI, whose abilities aren\u2019t bundled in the same way. An IQ test designed for humans might not say the same thing about a machine as it does about a person.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>There are other kinds of intelligence that aren\u2019t usually evaluated by IQ tests\u2014and are even further out of reach for most AI benchmarks. These include types of social intelligence, such as the ability to make psychological inferences, and types of physical intelligence, such as an understanding of causal relations between objects and forces or the ability to coordinate a body in an environment. Both are crucial for humans navigating complex situations.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"An old black-and-white photograph shows a man in a long coat standing next to a horse.

You must beware of both false positives and false negatives. Maybe the test taker appears smart only by taking shortcuts, like <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Clever-Hans\" target=\"_blank\">Clever Hans</a>, the famous horse that appeared to be capable of math but actually responded to nonverbal cues. Or maybe test takers appear stupid only because they are unfamiliar with the testing procedure or have perceptual difficulties.</p><p>It\u2019s also hard because notions of intelligence vary across place and time. \u201cThere is an interesting shift in our society in terms of what we think intelligence is and what aspects of it are valuable,\u201d says <a href=\"https://anna-ivanova.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Ivanova</a>, an assistant professor of psychology at Georgia Tech. For example, before encyclopedias and the Internet, \u201chaving a large access to facts in your head was considered a hallmark of intelligence.\u201d Now we increasingly prize fluid over crystallized intelligence.</p><h2>The History of AI Intelligence Tests</h2><p>Over the years, many people have presented machines with grand challenges that purported to require intelligence on par with our own. In 1958, a trio of prominent AI researchers <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5392645\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>, \u201cChess is the intellectual game <em><em>par excellence.</em></em>\u2026 If one could devise a successful chess machine, one would seem to have penetrated to the core of human intellectual endeavor.\u201d They did acknowledge the theoretical possibility that such a machine \u201cmight have discovered something that was as the wheel to the human leg: a device quite different from humans in its methods, but supremely effective in its way, and perhaps very simple.\u201d But they stood their ground: \u201cThere appears to be nothing of this sort in sight.\u201d In 1997, something of this sort was very much in sight when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\" target=\"_blank\">beat Garry Kasparov</a>, the reigning chess champion, while lacking the general intelligence even to play checkers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man leans over a chess board on a desk, studying the pieces.

For decades, passing what\u2019s now called the Turing test was considered a nearly impossible challenge and a strong indicator of AGI.</p><p>But this year, researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that when people conversed with both another person and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for 5 minutes and then had to guess which one was human, they picked the AI 73 percent of the time. Meanwhile, top language models frequently make mistakes that few people ever would, like miscounting the number of times the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@anthonyokeh/llms-worst-nightmare-the-strawberry-problem-af0b95ff05c2\" target=\"_blank\">letter<em><em> r</em></em> occurs in<em><em> strawberry</em></em></a>. They appear to be more wheel than human leg. So scientists are still searching for measures of humanlike intelligence that can\u2019t be hacked.</p><h2>The ARC Test for AGI</h2><p>There\u2019s one AGI benchmark that, while not perfect, has gained a high profile as a foil for most new frontier models. In 2019, <a href=\"https://fchollet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fran\u00e7ois Chollet</a>, then a software engineer at Google and now a founder of the AI startup <a href=\"https://ndea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ndea</a>, released a paper titled \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547\" target=\"_blank\">On the Measure of Intelligence</a>.\u201d Many people equate intelligence to ability, and general intelligence to a broad set of abilities. Chollet takes a narrower view of intelligence, counting only one specific ability as important\u2014the ability to acquire new abilities easily. Large language models (LLMs) like those powering ChatGPT do well on many benchmarks only after training on trillions of written words. When LLMs encounter a situation very unlike their training data, they frequently flop, unable to adjust. In Chollet\u2019s sense, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-do-you-test-the-iq-of-ai\" target=\"_self\">they lack intelligence</a>.</p><p>To go along with the paper, Chollet created a new AGI benchmark, called the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (<a href=\"https://arcprize.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ARC</a>). It features hundreds of visual puzzles, each with several demonstrations and one test. A demonstration has an input grid and an output grid, both filled with colored squares. The test has just an input grid. The challenge is to learn a rule from the demonstrations and apply it in the test, creating a new output grid.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two examples show small colorful shapes on black grids labeled \\u201cinput\\u201d and, on grids labeled \\u201coutput,\\u201d those same shapes at a larger scale and now interlocking.

Given examples of input-output grids, the system must apply the hidden pattern to a new test case\u2014something humans find easy but machines still struggle with. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>ARC focuses on fluid intelligence. \u201cTo solve any problem, you need some knowledge, and then you\u2019re going to recombine that knowledge on the fly,\u201d Chollet told me. To make it a test not of stored knowledge but of how one recombines it, the training puzzles are supposed to supply all the \u201ccore knowledge priors\u201d one needs. These include concepts like object cohesion, symmetry, and counting\u2014the kind of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-computers-learn-common-sense\" target=\"_blank\">common sense</a> a small child has. Given this training and just a few examples, can you figure out which knowledge to apply to a new puzzle? Humans can do most of the puzzles easily, but AI struggled, at least at first. Eventually, OpenAI created a version of its o3 reasoning model that <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough\" target=\"_blank\">outperformed the average human test taker</a>, achieving a score of 88 percent\u2014albeit at an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11831\" target=\"_blank\">estimated computing cost</a> of US $20,000 per puzzle. (OpenAI never released that model, so it\u2019s not on the leaderboard chart.)</p><p>This March, Chollet introduced a harder version, called <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/announcing-arc-agi-2-and-arc-prize-2025\" target=\"_blank\">ARC-AGI-2</a>. It\u2019s overseen by his new nonprofit, the ARC Prize Foundation. \u201cOur mission is to serve as a North Star towards AGI through enduring benchmarks,\u201d the group announced. ARC Prize is offering a million dollars in prize money, the bulk going to teams whose trained AIs can solve 85 percent of 120 new puzzles using only four graphics processors for 12 hours or less. The new puzzles are more complex than those from 2019, sometimes requiring the application of multiple rules, reasoning for multiple steps, or interpreting symbols. The average human score is 60 percent, and as of this writing the <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\">best AI score</a> is about 16 percent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two charts show different AI models\\u2019 performance on the ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 tests, with the score on the x axis and the cost per task on the y axis.\\u00a0\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"958cd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-charts-show-different-ai-models-u2019-performance-on-the-arc-agi-1-and-arc-agi-2-tests-with-the-score-on-the-x-axis-and-the.png?id=61618135&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">AI models have made gradual progress on the first version of the ARC-AGI benchmark, which was introduced in 2019. This year, the ARC Prize launched a new version with harder puzzles, which AI models are struggling with. Models are labeled low, medium, high, or thinking to indicate how much computing power they expend on their answers, with \u201cthinking\u201d models using the most.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>AI experts acknowledge ARC\u2019s value, and also its flaws. <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/\" target=\"_blank\">Jiaxuan You</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says ARC is \u201ca very good theoretical benchmark\u201d that can shed light on how algorithms function, but \u201cit\u2019s not taking into account the real-world complexity of AI applications, such as social reasoning tasks.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://melaniemitchell.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Melanie Mitchell</a>, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute, says it \u201ccaptures some interesting capabilities that humans have,\u201d such as the ability to abstract a new rule from a few examples. But given the narrow task format, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it captures what people mean when they say general intelligence.\u201d</p><p>Despite these caveats, ARC-AGI-2 may be the AI benchmark with the biggest performance gap between advanced AI and regular people, making it a potent indicator of AGI\u2019s headway. What\u2019s more, ARC is a work in progress. Chollet says AI might match human performance on the current test in a year or two, and he\u2019s already working on ARC-AGI-3. Each task will be like a miniature video game, in which the player needs to figure out the relevant concepts, the possible actions, and the goal.</p><h2>What Attributes Should an AGI Benchmark Test?</h2><p>Researchers keep rolling out benchmarks that probe different aspects of general intelligence. Yet each also reveals how incomplete our map of the territory remains.</p><p>One recent paper introduced <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=VsJ1K2HV3k\" target=\"_blank\">General-Bench</a>, a benchmark that uses five input modalities\u2014text, images, video, audio, 3D\u2014to test AI systems on hundreds of tasks that demand recognition, reasoning, creativity, ethical judgment, and other abilities to both comprehend and generate material. Ideally, an AGI would show synergy, leveraging abilities across tasks to outperform the best AI specialists. But at present, no AI can even handle all five modalities.</p><p>Other benchmarks involve virtual worlds. An April paper in <em><em>Nature</em></em> reports on <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08744-2\" target=\"_blank\">Dreamer</a>, a general algorithm from Google DeepMind that learned to perform over 150 tasks, including playing Atari games, controlling virtual robots, and obtaining diamonds in <em><em>Minecraft</em></em>. These tasks require perception, exploration, long-term planning, and interaction, but it\u2019s unclear how well Dreamer would handle real-world messiness. Controlling a video game is easier than controlling a real robot, says <a href=\"https://danijar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danijar Hafner</a>, the paper\u2019s lead author: \u201cThe character never falls on his face.\u201d The tasks also lack rich interaction with humans and an understanding of language in the context of gestures and surroundings. \u201cYou should be able to tell your household robot, \u2018Put the dishes into that cabinet and not over there,\u2019 and you point at [the cabinet] and it understands,\u201d he says. Hafner says his team is working to make the simulations and tasks more realistic.</p><p>Aside from these extant benchmarks, experts have long debated what an ideal demonstration would look like. Back in 1970, the AI pioneer Marvin Minsky <a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/robot/1970-darrach.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em><em>Life</em></em> that in \u201cthree to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being. I mean a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight.\u201d That panel of tasks seems like a decent start, if you could operationalize the game of office politics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby.</p><p>One 2024 paper in <em><em>Engineering</em></em> proposed the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209580992300293X\" target=\"_blank\">Tong test</a> (<em><em>tong</em></em> is Chinese for \u201cgeneral\u201d). Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby, giving researchers the opportunity to observe what the AIs do. The authors argue that benchmarks should test an AI\u2019s ability to explore and set its own goals, its alignment with human values, its causal understanding, and its ability to control a virtual or physical body. What\u2019s more, the benchmark should be capable of generating an infinite number of tasks involving dynamic physical and social interactions.</p><p>Others, like Minsky, have suggested tests that require interacting with the real world to various degrees: making coffee in an unfamiliar kitchen, turning a hundred thousand dollars into a million, or attending college on campus and earning a degree. Unfortunately, some of these tests are impractical and risk causing real-world harm. For example, an AI might earn its million by scamming people.</p><p>I asked Hinton, the Nobel Prize winner, what skills will be the hardest for AI to acquire. \u201cI used to think it was things like figuring out what other people are thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s already doing some of that. It\u2019s already able to do deception.\u201d (In a recent multi-university <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, an LLM outperformed humans at persuading test takers to select wrong answers.) He went on: \u201cSo, right now my answer is plumbing. Plumbing in an old house requires reaching into funny crevices and screwing things the right way. And I think that\u2019s probably safe for another 10 years.\u201d</p><p>Researchers debate whether the ability to perform physical tasks is required to demonstrate AGI. A paper from Google DeepMind on measuring <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=0ofzEysK2D\" target=\"_blank\">levels of AGI</a> says no, arguing that intelligence can show itself in software alone. They frame physical ability as an add-on rather than a requirement for AGI.</p><p>Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute says we should test capabilities involved in doing an entire job. She noted that AI can do many tasks of a human radiologist but can\u2019t replace the human because the job entails a lot of tasks that even the radiologist doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re doing, like figuring out what tasks to do and dealing with unexpected problems. \u201cThere\u2019s such a long tail of things that can happen in the world,\u201d she says. Some robotic vacuum cleaners weren\u2019t trained to recognize dog poop, she notes, and so they smeared it around the carpet. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of stuff like that that you don\u2019t think of when you\u2019re building an intelligent system.\u201d</p><p>Some scientists say we should observe not only performance but what\u2019s happening under the hood. A recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11581\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> coauthored by <a href=\"http://jeffclune.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Clune</a>, a computer scientist at the University of British Columbia, in Canada, reports that deep learning often leads AI systems to create \u201cfractured entangled representations\u201d\u2014basically a bunch of jury-rigged shortcuts wired together. Humans, though, look for broad, elegant regularities in the world. An AI system might appear intelligent based on one test, but if you don\u2019t know the system\u2019s innards, you could be surprised when you deploy it in a new situation and it applies the wrong rule.</p><h2>AGI Is Already Here, and Never Will Be</h2><p>The author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Carroll</a> once wrote of a character who used a map of the nation \u201con the scale of a mile to the mile!\u201d before eventually using the country as its own map. In the case of intelligence testing, the most thorough map of how someone will perform in a situation is to test them in the situation itself. In that vein, a strong test of AGI might be to have a robot live a full human life and, say, raise a child to adulthood.</p><p>\u201cUltimately, the real test of the capabilities of AI is what they do in the real world,\u201d Clune told me. \u201cSo rather than benchmarks, I prefer to look at which scientific discoveries [AIs] make, and which jobs they automate. If people are hiring them to do work instead of a human and sticking with that decision, that\u2019s extremely telling about the capabilities of AI.\u201d But sometimes you want to know how well something will do <em><em>before</em></em> asking it to replace a person.</p><p>We may never agree on what AGI or \u201chumanlike\u201d AI means, or what suffices to prove it. As AI advances, machines will still make mistakes, and people will point to these and say the AIs aren\u2019t really intelligent. Ivanova, the psychologist at Georgia Tech, was on a panel recently, and the moderator asked about AGI timelines. \u201cWe had one person saying that it might never happen,\u201d Ivanova told me, \u201cand one person saying that it already happened.\u201d So the term \u201cAGI\u201d may be convenient shorthand to express an aim\u2014or a fear\u2014but its practical use may be limited. In most cases, it should come with an asterisk, and a benchmark. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cCan We Build a Better IQ Test for AI?\u201d</em></p>"

Her father, a furniture store owner, and her mother, an artisan, instilled in her a love for learning and allowed her the freedom to dream big.</p><p>In 2012 she enrolled at <a href=\"https://www.unibh.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centro Universit\u00e1rio de Belo Horizonte</a> (UniBH) to study civil engineering. Delci chose what she calls a \u201csandwich bachelor\u2019s program\u201d\u2014an arrangement in which students begin their studies at their chosen local university, complete part of their coursework at a university abroad, and then return to their home institution to finish the degree.</p><p>In 2014 she was awarded a full scholarship by Brazil\u2019s federal <a href=\"https://estudonoexterior.com/science-without-borders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Without Borders</a> grant program. It covered tuition, housing, health insurance, learning materials, and airfare.</p><p>\u201cI believed that international academic experience would broaden my perspective and greatly enhance my education,\u201d Delci says. <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">But, she adds, she had to learn a new language to continue her studies.</a> First she took intensive English courses at <a href=\"https://ejf.hu/en/welcome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">E\u00f6tv\u00f6s J\u00f3zsef College</a>, in Baja, Hungary. She then completed two semesters of civil engineering courses, taught in English, at the <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>. From May to July 2015, she interned at <a href=\"https://www.vizmuvek.hu/en/home/aboutourcompany/company-information\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest Waterworks</a>, a city utility. She worked in the three main departments of the company: engineering, project management, and water treatment.</p><p>Delci returned to UniBH in the second semester of 2015 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2017. That same year, she earned a technical diploma in civil construction process operations from the <a href=\"https://www.fiemg.com.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federa\u00e7\u00e3o das Ind\u00fastrias do Estado de Minas Gerais</a>, a regional industry association based in Belo Horizonte.

In 2012, during her first stint at UniBH, she was an intern at <a href=\"https://www.delphiautoparts.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delphi</a> Automotive Systems do Brasil, in Itabirito, Minas Gerais. The role gave her hands-on experience in infrastructure maintenance of the industrial plant, including preparing purchase requisitions and work orders, as well as monitoring modifications in the plant layout, she says.</p><p>She joined Salum Constru\u00e7\u00f5es in 2020 as a trainee engineer<strong>. </strong>She worked on the remediation of waste rock piles at the <a href=\"https://vale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vale</a> <a href=\"https://www.gem.wiki/Vale_Vargem_Grande_Complex_Mine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vargem Grande complex</a> in Minas Gerais, part of Brazil\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://ief.mg.gov.br/w/floor-of-riches-the-iron-quadrangle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Quadrangle</a>.\u201d The site is one of many owned by Vale, the world\u2019s leading producer of iron ore.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to keep working on sustainable solutions, mentoring young engineers, and influencing policy to make the industry more environmentally responsible.\u201d</p><p>The initiative was part of Vale\u2019s broader efforts to minimize reliance on tailings dams\u2014earthen structures built to contain waste byproducts of ore processing\u2014 particularly after Brazil\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/09/world/americas/brazil-dam-collapse.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Brumadinho dam disaster</a> in 2019.

Among the methods she and her team tried was dry stacking, whereby fine, pulverized rock is filtered from tailings and deposited in piles rather than left in the form of sludge.</p><p>\u201cFurther studies and environmental licensing are still needed for large-scale implementation\u201d of dry stacking, she says.</p><p>Today, she\u2019s a civil engineer at Salum. As part of its corporate engineering team, she oversees several large-scale projects.</p><p>She uses cutting-edge technology including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://catenda.com/glossary/4d-bim-building-information-modeling-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4D building information modeling</a>. BIM, a digital construction planning method, uses <a href=\"https://www.gp-radar.com/3d-laser-scanning/bim-modeling\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3D modeling</a> to link each building component\u2014including earthworks, drainage systems and pavement layers\u2014with the construction schedule, with time being the fourth dimension. Such modeling makes the entire project more predictable by allowing teams to anticipate and mitigate risks before they impact the schedule. Her work also focuses on construction principles borrowed from<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/its-not-easy-being-lean\" target=\"_self\"> lean manufacturing</a> that emphasize reducing waste.</p><p>Her approach and knowledge have drawn the attention of her Salum peers and the construction industry at large, she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about digital engineering and how it can help reduce costs, save time, and improve safety,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about getting the work done. It\u2019s about doing it smarter and more sustainably.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s also helping to reshape a traditionally male-dominated field.</p><p>\u201cHeavy civil construction didn\u2019t intimidate me; it motivated me,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to show that engineering talent has no gender. There\u2019s space for women to lead here, and we\u2019re claiming it.\u201d</p><p>Her <a href=\"https://sevenpublicacoes.com.br/RCS/article/view/6635\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> has been published in <a href=\"https://sevenpublicacoes.com.br/RCS/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Revista Cientifica</em></em> <em><em>Sistem\u00e1tica</em></em></a>, the<a href=\"https://ojs.brazilianjournals.com.br/ojs/index.php/BRJD/index\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Brazilian Journal of Development</em></em></a>, and other journals. She has received recognition for leading initiatives that use digital technology to improve large-scale construction. A key indicator of this recognition is the widespread citation of her research by experts. For instance, her articles \u2018Digital Monitoring of Heavy Equipment...\u2019 and \u2018The Effectiveness of Last Planner System...\u2019 have been cited 66 and 56 times, respectively, according to Google Scholar. In academia, this level of citation is an exceptionally high honor, demonstrating that her work is a foundational and influential contribution to the advancement of knowledge in her field.</p><h2>The IEEE advantage</h2><p>Delci heard about IEEE through colleagues who praised its global network of members and technical resources.

Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.<br /></p><p>Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July. Leathers uses his <span>28</span>-foot (8.5-meter) boat for cultivating oysters at <a href=\"https://maineoceanfarms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maine Ocean Farms</a>, where roughly <span>3</span> million of the animals grow in dozens of floating cages.</p><p>Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine\u2019s <span>3</span>,<span>500</span> miles (5,633 kilometers) of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor. For Leathers, whose <span>10</span>-acre (4-hectare) sea farm is a significant presence in the cove where he operates, the swap is about being a good neighbor to the shoreside community.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>It\u2019s an innovation born from necessity for us,\u201d said Strater about his electric boat, which he docks each night at the <a href=\"https://www.seameadow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sea Meadow Marine Foundation</a>, the nonprofit boatyard and aquaculture innovation hub he runs with several other small business owners. \u201c[The boat] really works well for what we do with it, and we\u2019re letting farmers use it to see how it could work for them.\u201d</p><h2>The Rise of Electric Boats</h2><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-boats\" target=\"_blank\">Battery-powered vessels</a> are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/the-first-all-electric-tugboat-in-the-us-is-about-to-launch\" target=\"_blank\">tugboats</a>, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.</p><p>In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world\u2019s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>Everyone\u2019s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we\u2019ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,\u201d said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. ferries</a>. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two men stand outside the cockpit of an electric boat named Heron that sits on the water.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e15a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-men-stand-outside-the-cockpit-of-an-electric-boat-named-heron-that-sits-on-the-water.jpg?id=61664831&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Maine Ocean Farms founders Eric Oransky [left] and Willy Leathers switched to an electric workboat in July 2025.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.bullockweddings.com/index/G0000YGZ6gDoqSck\" target=\"_blank\">Brendan Bullock</a></small></p><p><span>Electrification has only very recently come to the U.S. aquaculture sector. In Maine, the small but fast-growing segment includes nearly </span><a href=\"https://maineaqua.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>200</span> farms</a><span> for shellfish, fin fish, and edible seaweed. Strater and Leathers are among the first in their business to trade gas motors for electric propulsion\u2014a switch they say they\u2019re hoping to accelerate. Oil-guzzling motors are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar seafood sector.</span></p><p>Still, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-container-ships-are-stuck-on-the-horizon\" target=\"_blank\">electrifying commercial watercraft can be a difficult course to navigate</a>, given the higher up-front costs of electric motors and the lack of charging infrastructure\u2014and grid infrastructure in general\u2014in rural waterfront communities.</p><p>Early adopters like Strater and Leathers said they hope the experiences gained from their demonstrations can help pave the way for decarbonizing Maine\u2019s blue economy. With the help of the <a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Island Institute</a>, a Maine-based nonprofit that works on marine-related energy transitions, Leathers is collecting performance data from his vessel to share more broadly with the industry.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>People say it looks cool and shiny and looks like it operates great,\u201d Lia Morris, the Island Institute\u2019s senior community development officer, said of electric boats. <span>\u201c</span>But we really want to be able to prove out the [business] case.\u201d <span>Electric boats can cost between </span><span>20 percent</span><span> and </span><span>30 percent</span><span> more than a gas- or diesel-powered vessel of a comparable size. However, owners can save on maintenance and fuel over the long term, Strater\u2019s business partner Nick Planson said.</span><br /></p><p><span>\u201c</span>The high-level math that we\u2019ve come up with\u201d is a financial break-even point of <span>\u201c</span>about four to five years, and then over a <span>10</span>-year time span, you\u2019re definitely coming out way ahead based on the vastly reduced maintenance cost, replacement cost of failed equipment, and fuel costs,\u201d said Planson.</p><h2>Battery-Powered Workboats Lack Charging Infrastructure</h2><p>But the initial price tag presents a significant hurdle. Strater and Planson\u2019s sleekly designed, no-frills watercraft cost US $<span>100</span>,<span>000</span> to build and outfit with a single electric outboard motor. Leathers\u2019s boat, called Heron, cost about four times as much. It has two electric outboards and a ramp for unloading and hauling more than <span>10</span>,<span>000</span> oysters at a time from the sea farm to distributors waiting on the dock. Its hull is also equipped with a small cabin and toilet.</p><p>Both operations relied on grant funding to defray the expense of going electric.</p><p>For their part, Strater and Planson used about $<span>50</span>,<span>000</span> from a larger U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/1031783-an-electric-workboat-for-the-aquaculture-industry.html\" target=\"_blank\">small business grant</a> they got in <span>2024</span> to establish a use case for electric workboats in the aquaculture industry. Leathers\u2019s business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $<span>500</span>,<span>000</span> U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) <a href=\"https://www.aquaculturenorthamerica.com/maine-ocean-farms-adopts-electric-workboats-for-oyster-farming/#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20able%20to%20bring%20this,of%20Energy%2C%20Office%20of%20Energy%20Efficiency%20and\" target=\"_blank\">grant</a> last year that earmarked about $<span>289</span>,<span>000</span> for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.</p><p>The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.</p><p>The <span>DOE</span>\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it\u2019s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d says Strater.</p><p>But federal grants aren\u2019t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises, Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a <span>\u201c</span>marine green\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ceimaine.org/financing/small-business-loans/#marine-green-loans\" target=\"_blank\">loan program</a> that can make the up-front costs of switching to electric propulsion more accessible to small businesses.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,\u201d said Nick Branchina, director of <span>CEI</span>\u2019s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, <span>CEI</span> offers loans starting at $<span>25</span>,<span>000</span> for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.</p><p><span>Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to </span><span>\u201c</span><span>take a reasonable swing\u201d at electric propulsion.</span></p><p>Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.</p><h2>How Do Electric Boats Perform in Cold Weather?</h2><p><span></span><span>This summer, Leathers said he\u2019s had no trouble making the nearly 2-mile (3-kilometer) round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he\u2019s not sure how far the outboards\u2019 two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor\u2019s range. It\u2019s a part of Leathers\u2019s demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.</span></p><p>Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they\u2019re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of <span>2024</span>. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, <a href=\"https://www.shredelectric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shred Electric</a>, a boat\u2019s ability to run through the year\u2019s coldest months is a key selling point.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Planson. <span>\u201c</span>When you\u2019re working with\u2026waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.\u201d</p><p>Strater and Planson said their boat\u2019s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations 7 miles (11 kilometers) away. In the <span>10</span> months since the boat\u2019s launch, Strater has learned that range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat\u2019s pace depending on how far he wants to go.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d he said.</p><p><span></span><span>Soon, Maine\u2019s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level </span><span>2</span><span> charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over 2 hours, or three times as fast as the current system. The startup </span><a href=\"https://www.aqua-superpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua SuperPower</a><span> was awarded a portion of the </span><span>DOE</span><span> funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.</span></p><p>Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said Morris, of the Island Institute. As the state\u2019s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.</p><p>Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a <span>\u201c</span>chicken and egg\u201d problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there\u2019s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.</p><p>This challenge is compounded by both New England\u2019s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region\u2019s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it\u2019s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route <span>1</span>.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>There are a lot of complicated questions,\u201d Morris said. <span>\u201c</span>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to Maine, it\u2019s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.\u201d</p><p>Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm\u2019s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.</p><p><span></span><span>\u201c</span><span>As a whole industry, I think it\u2019s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,\u201d Leathers said. </span><span>\u201c</span><span>And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.\u201d</span> </p>"

In collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE History Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/globalmuseum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Global Museum</a> and the support of generous donors, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/chip-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_self\">Chip Hall of Fame</a> has been adapted into a traveling exhibit that has just begun making its way around U.S. museums, and, hopefully, the world.</p><p>Our Chip Hall of Fame celebrates microchips that have had a significant impact. Six of the chips from the hall were chosen to be part of the \u201cChips That Shook The World\u201d exhibit, along with artifacts embodying how each was used. One of the chosen was the 8-bit <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6502-microprocessor/\" target=\"_self\">6502</a> processor, so naturally we thought a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/commodore-64\" target=\"_self\">Commodore 64</a> home computer, which used a 6502 variant, should be one of the artifacts. Which led to another thought: Why not have the C64 run a program demonstrating an 8-bit CPU in action?</p><p>That\u2019s how I ended up, 35 years after I last programmed a C64, sitting at my office desk creating a brand-new plug-in cartridge.</p><p>The C64 supported <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Cartridge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plug-in cartridges</a> as a way of distributing software, and our demo program needed to be put on one. Each morning, the museum curator can just turn on the exhibit and presto! The demo program instantly begins running. The alternatives would have required the curator to type in commands to load the demo manually.</p><p>But this convenience comes with two big caveats: One, the demo has to fit into just 16 kilobytes, the maximum size of a cartridge. Even by the standards of the 1980s, this is small, as some C64 titles spanned <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Newcomer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of kilobytes</a> by loading data in chunks from disk or tape. Two, the demo would have to be written in <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-6502-assembly-and-low-level-programming-7c11fa6b9cb9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6502 assembly</a> and control the C64 video hardware directly.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"The components required to make a Commodore 64 cartridge.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"95d88\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-components-required-to-make-a-commodore-64-cartridge.png?id=61614662&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cartridges require only a few components: a printed circuit board [bottom right], programmable memory chip [bottom middle], and some resistors, diodes, and a capacitor [top middle].

To make the video output compatible with modern screens, we used a RetroTink-2X Pro adapter [bottom left].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Fortunately, from attending <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/theyre-alive-vintage-computer-fans-keep-the-great-machines-of-the-past-running\" target=\"_self\">Vintage Computer Federation events</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6ZCubprsSO/\" target=\"_blank\"> over the years</a>, I knew there were a lot of free or inexpensive resources that would make it easier than ever before to do this sort of thing.</p><p>The first step was to figure out just how much I could do in 16 KB. The C64\u2019s graphics hardware was groundbreaking in its day, capable of displaying images of up to 320 by 200 pixels with a palette of 16 colors. It could also display eight sprites at once; each sprite is a moveable single-color 24-by-21 pixel bitmap. The price for this power was complexity. The <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/VIC\" target=\"_blank\">video chip\u2019s control registers</a>, screen bitmaps, text-screen data, default and custom character sets, sprites, and color information all live in different locations scattered across memory, with some data actually living in <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color_RAM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">separate RAM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Character_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ROM</a> chips.</p><p>So I sat down with the detailed <a href=\"https://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">memory maps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Graphics_Modes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video hardware programming guides</a> available for the C64. (This abundance of information is in stark contrast to the 1980s, when documentation was scant, even from Commodore itself). I worked out that I could cram in nine screens of explanatory text, animated graphics, and sprites. Creating these screens, including the custom character sets and sprites they rely on, was greatly simplified thanks to the online C64 graphics editor at <a href=\"https://petscii.krissz.hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">petscii.krissz.hu</a>. The editor can output some results as stand-alone assembly programs, which I adapted as subroutines in my demo code.</p><p>I had just enough space remaining for a lucky find. I wanted to display at least one full-screen bitmapped image, but a prerendered image would have required 8 KB of data, half the cartridge\u2019s capacity. Instead I decided to use a classic hack of programmers since the days of games like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Rogue</em></em></a><em> </em>and<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Elite</em></em></a>: pulling free data out of the structure of mathematics by way of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">procedural generation</a>.</p><p>Here\u2019s where I got lucky: I came across the work of Marcello M., who had published the source for a C64 <a href=\"https://retro64.altervista.org/blog/the-mandelbrot-set-c64-assembly-program-to-draw-it-fast-using-integer-math-part-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assembly program</a> that quickly created a multicolor fractal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mandelbrot set</a> using just 3.3 KB of code. With Marcello\u2019s blessing, I incorporated his code as another subroutine.</p><h2>Modern Tools For Writing C64 Software</h2><p>The coding was done using the free <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ide65xx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IDE 65xx</a> and <a href=\"https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kick Assembler</a> desktop software. I was able to test the code using the popular C64 <a href=\"https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vice emulator</a>, which allowed me to do handy things like examining live memory contents to find runtime bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A diagram showing 64 kilobytes of RAM with a Kernal ROM occupying the top 8 KB, followed by 4 KB of character ROM, and then 8 KB of Basic ROM. Another column shows I/O and color RAM mapped to the same position as the character ROM, and two shadow ROM locations in lower memory. Finally a third column shows a 16 KB cartridge ROM overlapping the Basic ROM and the memory below it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"71b5d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-64-kilobytes-of-ram-with-a-kernal-rom-occupying-the-top-8-kb-followed-by-4-kb-of-character-rom-and-then-8-kb.png?id=61613059&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Regions of the Commodore 64\u2019s RAM were mapped to things like the system ROMs, video-color memory, and the bitmaps of characters, the latter of which were actually mapped to multiple locations in RAM when accessed by the video hardware. Some of these mappings overlapped: Inserting a 16-KB cartridge automatically disabled the ROM storing the Basic interpreter. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p><span>The next step was to make a physical cartridge. Again, there\u2019s modern help, this time in the form of US $5 printed circuit boards that need just a handful of components soldered in to make a cartridge. These components include a programmable ROM chip that I picked up for </span><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/363498306025\" target=\"_blank\">$3 on eBay</a><span>. I burned my code to the memory chip with my trusty </span><a href=\"http://autoelectric.cn/EN/TL866_main.html\" target=\"_blank\">TL866 programmer</a><span> and mounted it to the PCB, which in turn was mounted into a </span><a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:692797\" target=\"_blank\">3D-printed cartridge case</a><span>.</span></p><p>Then came the moment of truth. It probably won\u2019t come as a surprise to regular readers that I already own an original C64, which I connect to modern flat-screen displays via a <a href=\"https://www.retrotink.com/shop/retrotink-2x-pro\" target=\"_blank\">RetroTink-2X Pro</a> adapter. So I carefully pushed the cartridge into its slot and turned the machine on.</p><p>Naturally, my C64 immediately froze up. I had forgotten to remove a little bit of memory-management code that made the demo work in the Vice emulator by disabling the ROM that stores the C64\u2019s Basic interpreter. On the real hardware, this snippet ended up disabling half the cartridge\u2019s memory. A quick edit and a trip back to the TL866 and I was ready to try again. Success! I was finally literally ready to ship some software, all the way to <a href=\"https://www.uplandexhibits.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Upland Exhibits</a>, the people building our traveling display.</p><p>I hope you get a chance to see my little demo and our \u201cChips That Changed The World\u201d exhibit in person: We\u2019ll post current and upcoming locations on the Chip Hall of Fame page. But in the meantime, whether you used the C64 back in the day, or are just looking for a fun coding challenge, I recommend trying your hand at programming this 8-bit classic, now that so many of the original pain points have been reduced!</p>"

The antenna was 15.24 meters long by 6.1 meters wide, weighing in at 16,329 kilograms.

Despite its large size, the machine could be precisely aimed.</p><p>Unlike other antennas that are tuned to only one frequency, the Holmdel antenna worked across a wide band of frequencies, so it could pick up several types of radio signals.

Semiconductor manufacturing, large physics experiments in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-hadron-collider-starts-up\" target=\"_blank\">particle</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/black-holes-bumping-in-the-light-ligo-hears-gravitational-waves-with-increasing-sensitivity\" target=\"_blank\">wave detection</a>, some <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-network-interface\" target=\"_self\">quantum-computing platforms</a>, and surface-analysis tools, including <a href=\"https://sustainable-nano.com/2017/07/26/x-ray-photoelectron-spectroscopy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</a>, all require so-called ultrahigh vacuum.</p><p>At these low levels of particles per unit volume, vacuum is parameterized by pressure, measured in pascals. Regular atmospheric pressure is 10<span><sup>5</sup></span> Pa. Ultrahigh vacuum is considered to be anything less than about 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Some applications require as low as 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa. The deepest depths of space still hold the nothingness record, reaching below 10<span><sup>-20</sup></span> Pa.</p><p>The method of choice for measuring pressure in the ultrahigh vacuum regime is the ionization gauge. \u201cThey work by a fairly straightforward mechanism that dates back to vacuum tubes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/stephen-eckel\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Eckel</a>, a member of the cold-atom vacuum-measurement team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"red light shining from a circular window in a metal vacuum chamber. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4bd3f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/red-light-shining-from-a-circular-window-in-a-metal-vacuum-chamber.png?id=61612440&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A portable cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool [top] detects the fluorescence of roughly 1 million lithium atoms [bottom], and infers the vacuum pressure based on how quickly the fluorescence decays. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Photos: Jayme Thornton</small></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"small dot of red light in the middle of a circular window. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09866\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/small-dot-of-red-light-in-the-middle-of-a-circular-window.png?id=61609895&amp;width=980\" /></p><p>Indeed, an ionization gauge has the same basic components as a vacuum tube. The gauge contains a heated filament that emits electrons into the chamber. The electrons are accelerated toward a positively charged grid. En route to the grid, the electrons occasionally collide with atoms and molecules flying around in the vacuum, knocking off their electrons and creating positively charged ions. These ions are then collected by a negatively charged electrode. The current generated by these positive ions is proportional to the number of atoms floating about in the vacuum, giving a pressure reading.</p><p>Ion gauges are relatively cheap (under US $1,000) and commonplace. However, they come with a few difficulties. First, although the current in the ion gauge is proportional to the pressure in the chamber, that proportionality constant depends on a lot of fine details, such as the precise geometry of the filament and the grid. The current cannot be easily calculated from the electrical and physical characteristics of the setup\u2014ion gauges require thorough calibrations. \u201cA full calibration run on the ion gauges is like a full month of somebody\u2019s time,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/daniel-barker\" target=\"_blank\"> Daniel Barker</a>, a physicist at NIST who\u2019s also working on the cold-atom vacuum-measurement project.</p><p>Second, the calibration services provided by NIST (among others) calibrate down to only 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Performance below that pressure is questionable, even for a well-calibrated gauge. What\u2019s more, at lower pressures, the heat from the ion gauge becomes a problem: Hotter surfaces emit atoms in a process called outgassing, which pollutes the vacuum. \u201cIf you\u2019re shooting for a vacuum chamber with really low pressures,\u201d Madison says, \u201cthese ionization gauges actually work against you, and many people turn them off.\u201d</p><p>Third, the reading on the ion gauge depends very strongly on the types of atoms or molecules present in the vacuum. Different types of atoms could produce readings that vary by up to a factor of four. This variance is fine if you know exactly what\u2019s inside your vacuum chamber, or if you don\u2019t need that precise a measurement. But for certain applications, especially in research settings, these concerns are significant.</p><h2>How a cold-atom vacuum standard works</h2><p>The idea of a cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool developed as a surprising side effect of the study of cold atoms. Scientists first started cooling atoms down in an effort to make better atomic clocks back in the 1970s. Since then, cooling atoms and trapping them has become a cottage industry, giving rise to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-atomic-clocks\" target=\"_self\">optical atomic clocks</a>, atomic <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/accelerometer-quantum-bose-einstein\" target=\"_self\">navigation systems</a>, and neutral-atom quantum computers.</p><p>These experiments have to be done in a vacuum, to prevent the surrounding environment from heating the atoms. For decades, the vacuum was thought of as merely a finicky factor to be implemented as well as possible. \u201cVacuum limitations on atom traps have been known since the dawn of atom traps,\u201d Eckel says. Atoms flying around the vacuum chamber would collide with the cooled atoms and knock them out of their trap, leading to loss. The better the vacuum, the slower that process would go.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A glass cylinder with a coil inside it on a gray background. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b512d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-glass-cylinder-with-a-coil-inside-it-on-a-gray-background.png?id=61609862&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The most common vacuum-measurement tool in the high-vacuum range today is the ion gauge, basically a vacuum tube in reverse: A hot filament emits electrons that fly toward a positively charged grid, ionizing background atoms and molecules along the way. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p>UBC\u2019s Kirk Madison and his collaborator <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-booth-57a28b12/?originalSubdomain=ca\" target=\"_blank\">James Booth</a> (then at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, in Burnaby), were among the first to turn that thinking on its <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.80.022712\" target=\"_blank\">head</a> back in the 2000s. Instead of battling the vacuum to preserve the trapped atoms, they thought, why not use the trapped atoms as a <a href=\"https://patents.justia.com/patent/8803072\" target=\"_blank\">sensor</a> to measure how empty the vacuum is?<p>To understand how they did that, consider a typical cold-atom vacuum-measurement device. Its main component is a vacuum chamber filled with a vapor of a particular atomic species. Some experiments use rubidium, while others use lithium. Let\u2019s call it lithium between friends.</p><p>A tiny amount of lithium gas is introduced into the vacuum, and some of it is captured in a magneto-optical trap. The trap consists of a magnetic field with zero intensity at the center of the trap, increasing gradually away from the center. Six laser beams point toward the center from above, below, the left, the right, the front, and the back. The magnetic and laser forces are arranged so that any lithium atom that might otherwise fly away from the center is most likely to absorb a photon from the lasers, getting a momentum kick back into the trap.</p><p>The trap is quite shallow, meaning that hot atoms\u2014above 1 kelvin or so\u2014will not be captured. So the result is a small, confined cloud of really cold atoms, at the center of the trap. Because the atoms absorb laser light occasionally to keep them in the trap, they also reemit light, creating fluorescence. Measuring this fluorescence allows scientists to calculate how many atoms are in the trap.</p><p>To use this setup to measure vacuum, you load the atoms into the magneto-optical trap and measure the fluorescence. Then, you turn off the light and hold the atoms in just the magnetic field. During this time, background atoms in the vacuum will chance upon the trapped atoms, knocking them out. After a little while, you turn the light back on and check how much the fluorescence has decreased. This measures how many atoms got knocked out, and therefore how many collisions occurred.</p><p>The reason you need the trap to be so shallow and the atoms to be so cold is that these collisions are very weak. \u201cA few collisions are quite energetic, but most of the background gas particles fly by and, like, whisper to the trapped atom, and it just gently moves away,\u201d Madison says.</p><p>This method has several advantages over the traditional ion-gauge measurement. The atomic method does not need calibration; the rate at which fluorescence dims depending on the vacuum pressure can be calculated accurately. These calculations are involved, but in a paper published in 2023 the NIST team <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article/5/3/035001/2905161/Accurate-measurement-of-the-loss-rate-of-cold\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated</a> that the latest method of calculation shows excellent agreement with their experiment. Because this technique does not require calibration, it can serve as a primary standard for vacuum pressure, and even potentially be used to calibrate ion gauges.</p><p>The cold-atom measurement is also much less finicky when it comes to the actual contents of the vacuum. Whether the vacuum is contaminated with helium or plutonium, the measured pressure will vary by perhaps only a few percent, while the ion gauge sensitivity and reading for these particles might differ by an order of magnitude, Eckel says.</p><p>Cold atoms could also potentially measure much lower vacuum pressures than ion gauges can. The current lowest pressure they\u2019ve reliably measured is around 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa, and NIST scientists are working on figuring out what the lower boundary might be. \u201cWe honestly don\u2019t know what the lower limit is, and we\u2019re still exploring that question,\u201d Eckel says.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"A chart of vacuum pressures in the universe\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b1f21\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-of-vacuum-pressures-in-the-universe.png?id=61612598&amp;width=980\" /><p class=\"caption\">No vacuum is completely empty. The degree to which vacuum pressure approaches pure nothingness is measured in pascals, with Earth\u2019s atmosphere clocking in at 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and intergalactic space at a measly 10<sup>-20</sup>. In between, the new cold-atom vacuum gauges can measure further along the emptiness scale than the well-established ionization gauges can.</p><p class=\"media-photo-credit\">Sources: S. Eckel (cold-atom gauge, ionization gauge); K. Zou (molecular-beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition); L. Monteiro, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.luizmonteiro.com/StdAtm.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1976 Standard Atmosphere Properties</a>\u201d (Earth\u2019s atmosphere); E.J. \u00d6pik, <em><em>Planetary and Space Science</em></em> (1962) (Mars, moon atmosphere); A. Chambers, \u2018Modern Vacuum Physics\u201d (2004) (interplanetary and intergalactic space)</p><p>Of course, the cold-atom approach also has drawbacks. It struggles at higher pressure, above 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa, so its applications are confined to the ultrahigh vacuum range. And, although there are no commercial atomic vacuum sensors available yet, they are likely to be much more expensive than ion gauges, at least to start.</p><p>That said, there are many applications where these devices could unlock new possibilities. At large science experiments, including LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and ones at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), well-placed cold-atom vacuum sensors could measure the vacuum pressure and also help determine where a potential leak might be coming from.</p><p>In semiconductor development, a particularly promising application is molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). MBE is used to produce the few, highly pure semiconductor layers used in laser diodes and devices for high-frequency electronics and quantum technologies. The technique functions in ultrahigh vacuum, with pure elements in separate containers heated on one end of the vacuum. The elements travel across the vacuum until they hit the target surface, where they grow one layer at a time.</p><p>Precisely controlling the proportion of the ingredient elements is essential to the success of MBE. Normally, this requires a lot of trial and error, building up thin films and checking whether the proportions are correct, then adjusting as needed. With a cold-atom vacuum sensor, the quantity of each element emitted into the vacuum can be detected on the fly, greatly speeding up the process.</p><p>\u201cIf this technique could be used in molecular-beam epitaxy or other ultrahigh vacuum environments, I think it will really benefit materials development,\u201d says <a href=\"https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/ke-zou/\" target=\"_blank\">Ke Zou</a>, an assistant professor of physics at UBC who studies molecular-beam epitaxy. In these high-tech industries, researchers may find that the ability to measure nothing is everything. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue.</em></p>"

After NIST\u2019s validation, microscope manufacturers commercialized the SCM, chipmakers adopted them to study integrated circuits, thus opening the door to the next generation of semiconductors.</p><h2>Why the RCA VideoDisc Failed </h2><p>But no story about the scanning capacitance microscope\u2019s triumph would be complete without some discussion of the VideoDisc\u2019s failure.

Why?</p><p>The VideoDisc effort had begun in the early 1960s, when RCA asked itself, \u201cWhat comes after color TV? What will be the next major consumer electronics system?\u201d The company decided that the answer was some type of system to play prerecorded movies and TV shows through your television. RCA was far from alone in pursuing this idea. All of the home video systems under development included a storage medium\u2014film, magnetic tape, nonmagnetic tape, and vinyl discs of various size and composition\u2014and a device to play back the audio and video in high resolution. In addition to magnetic methods, information could be stored using electromechanical, photographic, electron-beam, or optical technologies.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a smiling man in a business suit holding a shiny flat disc and inserting a flat square object into a machine.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"dc554\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-smiling-man-in-a-business-suit-holding-a-shiny-flat-disc-and-inserting-a-flat-square-object-into-a-ma.jpg?id=61609185&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">RCA VideoDiscs were easily damaged by dust and fingerprints, so they were loaded into the SelectaVision player inside plastic sleeves.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Hagley Museum and Library</small></p><p>By 1964, RCA had settled on VideoDiscs. Like a record album (which the company had pioneered), a VideoDisc was a grooved vinyl platter that uses a stylus for playback. Unlike a record, the VideoDisc carried both audio and video, at a much higher density, and the stylus was electrical instead of mechanical. (The VideoDisc is sometimes confused with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc\" target=\"_blank\">LaserDisc</a>, a home video technology of that era that used an optical laser.)</p><p>RCA called its discs Capacitance Electronic Discs. The VideoDisc player spun the 30-centimeter disc at a constant 450 rpm. A metallic stylus traced the depressions and bumps in the disc\u2019s groove by registering differences in capacitance, similar to the way that bringing your finger into contact with a touchscreen causes a detectable change in the screen\u2019s capacitance at that point. Solid-state circuitry unscrambled the frequency-modulated video signal encoded in the capacitance differences. These differences were on the order of femtofarads, and the video signal ran at about 910 megahertz. To get a clear picture, the VideoDisc system required very sensitive capacitance sensors to detect these tiny differences at high frequency.</p><p>Unfortunately, commercialization took much longer than expected. In 1972, RCA announced that its VideoDisc would debut the following year, but it didn\u2019t materialize. An article in <em><em>Popular Science </em></em>in February 1977 anticipated regional sales by the end of that year. But it wasn\u2019t until March 1981 that the RCA SelectaVision system finally hit the market. Despite heavy promotion, it sold poorly and was pulled from the shelves in 1984. In the end, RCA sank about US $500 million over 20 years to develop the VideoDisc, and it was a total flop.</p><h2>How Videotape Vanquished the VideoDisc</h2><p>What went wrong? In a word: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-panasonic-pv1563-vcr\" target=\"_self\">videotape</a>. Magnetic tape, which RCA had rejected, turned out to have greater consumer appeal. Introduced in 1976, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/revisiting-the-vcrs-origins\" target=\"_self\">VHS tapes</a> were cheaper, had more titles available for purchase or rent, and, importantly, allowed owners to record their own programs.</p><p>Perhaps if the VideoDisc had launched in 1973, it might have had a chance. But the technology had other problems. Fingerprints, dust, and scratches torpedoed early designs that envisioned users removing the discs from sleeves as casually as record albums; instead, the final version kept the discs encased in a plastic shell that was then inserted into the player.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a man in a lab coat and tie pulling a flat shiny disc from a protective sleeve labeled RCA SelectaVision.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"55e43\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-in-a-lab-coat-and-tie-pulling-a-flat-shiny-disc-from-a-protective-sleeve-labeled-rca-selectavisio.jpg?id=61607508&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">RCA spent two decades developing its home video system, but in the end the SelectaVision lost out to VHS and VCRs.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Hagley Museum and Library        </small> </p><p>Another problem was running time. In 1977, VideoDiscs could hold only about 30 minutes of material per side. That rose to an hour per side by the time of product launch, but that still meant that any movie over 120 minutes would have to be spread over multiple discs. The first VHS tapes could hold 120 minutes of video (double that of its main tape competitor, Betamax). And VHS kept extending that lead: By the 1980s, VHS had long play (four hours) and extended play (six hours) versions, albeit with noticeable drops in resolution quality.</p><p>RCA forecasters also badly misread the economics of VideoDisc players. Their 1977 price estimate for a VideoDisc player was $500 (about $2,800 in today\u2019s dollars). The first VHS players were much more expensive, ranging from $1,000 to $1,400, but by the mid-1980s, their price had dropped to $200 to $400. VHS tapes of major Hollywood films cost about $80\u2014much more than VideoDiscs\u2019 $10 to $18 price tag\u2014but only diehard fans actually paid the modern equivalent of about $440 to buy a movie on videotape. For everyone else, the Hollywood studios licensed titles to third-party rental companies. Seemingly overnight, independent video shops, supermarkets, and national chains like Blockbuster were renting movies for a small fee. For a brief period, RCA VideoDiscs shared the shelves with videotapes, but usually only at independent shops and never with as many titles available.</p><p>Meanwhile, RCA struggled to sell its VideoDisc players. The company had forecast eventual annual sales of five to six million players; its first-year goal was a more modest 200,000, and yet it sold only half that number. By 1984, RCA realized the VideoDisc would never come close to 50 percent market penetration, let alone profitability, and pulled the plug.</p><h2>Birth of the Scanning Capacitance Microscope</h2><p>Normally that would be the end of the story, another failed venture in consumer electronics. But back when RCA scientists first began researching the VideoDisc, there were no microscopes capable of identifying the tiny variations in the disc that encoded the audio/video signal. The bumps and depressions were less than a tenth the size of the groove itself; even the most advanced microscopes of the day couldn\u2019t detect features that small.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman in a hairnet, lab coat, and white gloves holding a shiny flat disc with a hole in a center, with two stacks of discs in the foreground.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5a291\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-in-a-hairnet-lab-coat-and-white-gloves-holding-a-shiny-flat-disc-with-a-hole-in-a-center-wit.jpg?id=61607494&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A factory worker inspects an RCA VideoDisc, which encoded the audio and video signals in the disc\u2019s groove.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Hagley Museum and Library        </small> </p>And so RCA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrmatey/\" target=\"_blank\">James Matey</a> developed and patented the scanning capacitance microscope (which he abbreviated SCaM, but others wisely shortened to SCM) as a quality-control tool for manufacturing the VideoDiscs. Four years after the first patent, RCA filed a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/USRE32457E/en\" target=\"_blank\">reissue patent</a> with some corrections and improvements. In a very readable paper in the March 1985 issue of the <em><em>Journal of Applied Physics,</em></em> Matey and fellow RCA researcher Joseph Blanc explained the new technology. The SCM could detect variations in surface topography on the order of 0.3 nanometers over areas on the order of 0.5 square micrometers. RCA delayed publication of this paper until it had shuttered the VideoDisc operation, and so Matey and Blanc concluded their paper, \u201cWe are currently in the process of adapting [the SCM] for similar uses on other samples.\u201d The new use turned out to be in the manufacturing of the next generation of semiconductors.<p>Semiconductor performance depends on the distribution of intentionally introduced impurities, called dopants, which change the ability of the material to conduct electricity. In the early days of semiconductor production, manufacturers used ion mass spectroscopy and a technique called spreading resistance to measure the dopant distribution in one dimension.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">Related: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-secondhand-origins-of-silicon-valleys-ingot-industry\" target=\"_self\">The Secondhand Origins of Silicon Valley\u2019s Ingot Industry</a></p><p>By the late 1980s, integrated circuits had become so small that the industry needed a way to measure the dopants in two dimensions. The SCM, used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope, fit the bill. When the conductive tip of the atomic force microscope made contact with a semiconductor surface, it created a small capacitance, on the order of attofarads to femtofarads, depending on the dopant concentration. The SCM measured the changes of the local capacitance and mapped the dopant distributions. But the technology was still novel and not yet commercially available, so researchers at NIST took up the task of testing it.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Joseph Kopanski, Jay Marchiando, and David Berning began building a series of custom SCMs at the NIST Semiconductor Electronics Division. They did more than just reproduce Matey and Blanc\u2019s results. They also provided the industry with models and software for extracting two-dimensional dopant distribution from the capacitance measurements.</p><p>NIST\u2019s validation of the SCM led to the commercial production of the instruments, which in turn led to the development of more-advanced semiconductors\u2014an industry that is orders of magnitude more important to the global economy than a consumer product like the VideoDisc would ever have been. It\u2019s a classic tale of redemption in the history of technology: At the start of any new tech project, no one really knows what the outcome will be. Sometimes, you just have to keep going, even through abject failure, and trust that something good will emerge on the other side.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cRCA\u2019s VideoDisc Gamble Paid Off in Chips.\u201d</em></em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>My friends at NIST first suggested the scanning capacitance microscope in their collection and pointed me to <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/nist-museum/videodiscs-and-scanning-capacitance-microscope-failed-consumer-product-solves\" target=\"_blank\">a great description</a> of it.

As semiconductor devices grow more complex, engineers face the challenge of validating performance and catching edge cases under tight schedules. Test setups often include oscilloscopes, waveform generators, network analyzers, and more, potentially from different vendors with unique automation and configuration considerations. In order to keep pace with semiconductor validation requirements, multi-channel test setups designed for flexibility and performance can help engineers scale effectively.</p><span><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/762929\" target=\"_blank\">Register now for this free webinar!</a></span><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/762929\"></a>"

The exploit impacts Unitree\u2019s Go2 and B2 quadrupeds and G1 and H1 humanoids. Because the vulnerability is wireless, and the resulting access to the affected platform is complete, the vulnerability becomes wormable, </span><a href=\"https://github.com/Bin4ry/UniPwn?tab=readme-ov-file#the-wormable-threat\" target=\"_blank\">say the researchers</a>, meaning \u201ca<span>n infected robot can simply scan for other Unitree robots in BLE range and automatically compromise them, creating a robot botnet that spreads without user intervention.\u201d</span></p><p>Initially discovered by security researchers Andreas Makris and Kevin Finisterre, <a href=\"https://github.com/Bin4ry/UniPwn\" target=\"_blank\">UniPwn</a> takes advantage of several security lapses that are still present in the firmware of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/unitree\" target=\"_blank\">Unitree</a> robots as of 20 September 2025. As far as <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> is aware, this is the first major public exploit of a commercial humanoid platform.</p><h2>Unitree Robots\u2019 BLE Security Flaw Exposed</h2><p>Like many robots, Unitree\u2019s robots use an initial BLE connection to make it easier for a user to set up a Wi-Fi network connection. The BLE packets that the robot accepts are encrypted, but those encryption keys are hardcoded and were <a href=\"https://x.com/Bin4ryDigit/status/1950566849072005304\" target=\"_blank\">published on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by Makris in July. Although the robot does validate the contents of the BLE packets to make sure that the user is authenticated, the researchers say that all it takes to become an authenticated user is to encrypt the string \u201cunitree\u201d with the hardcoded keys and the robot will let someone in. From there, an attacker can inject arbitrary code masquerading as the Wi-Fi SSID and password, and when the robot attempts to connect to Wi-Fi, it will execute that code without any validation and with root privileges.</p><p>\u201cA simple attack might be just to reboot the robot, which we published as a proof of concept,\u201d explains Makris. \u201cBut an attacker could do much more sophisticated things: It would be possible to have a trojan implanted into your robot\u2019s startup routine to exfiltrate data while disabling the ability to install new firmware without the user knowing. And as the vulnerability uses BLE, the robots can easily infect each other, and from there the attacker might have access to an army of robots.\u201d</p><p>Makris and Finisterre first contacted Unitree in May in an attempt to responsibly disclose this vulnerability. After some back and forth with little progress, Unitree stopped responding to the researchers in July, and the decision was made to make the vulnerability public. \u201cWe have had some bad experiences communicating with them,\u201d Makris tells us, citing an <a href=\"https://takeonme.org/cves/cve-2025-2894/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier backdoor vulnerability</a> he discovered with the Unitree Go1. \u201cSo we need to ask ourselves\u2014are they introducing vulnerabilities like this on purpose, or is it sloppy development? Both answers are equally bad.\u201d</p><p>Unitree has not responded to a request for comment from <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> as of press time. On 29 September, Unitree posted a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/unitreerobotics_statement-to-our-respected-unitree-users-activity-7378441101927436288-lLdA/\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> on LinkedIn addressing the security concerns: \u201cWe have become aware that some users have discovered security vulnerabilities and network-related issues while using our robots,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe immediately began addressing these concerns and have now completed the majority of the fixes. These updates will be rolled out to you in the near future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnitree, as other manufacturers do, has simply ignored prior security disclosures and repeated outreach attempts,\u201d says V\u00edctor Mayoral-Vilches, the founder of robotics cybersecurity company <a href=\"https://aliasrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alias Robotics</a>. \u201cThis is not the right way to cooperate with security researchers.\u201d Mayoral-Vilches was not involved in publishing the UniPwn exploit, but he has found <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vmayoral_cybersecurity-ai-humanoid-robots-as-attack-activity-7374789262157901824-nE0I/\" target=\"_blank\">other security issues</a> with Unitree robots, including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14139\" target=\"_blank\">undisclosed streaming of telemetry data to servers in China</a> which could potentially include audio, visual, and spatial data.</p><p>Mayoral-Vilches explains that security researchers are focusing on Unitree primarily because the robots are available and affordable. This makes them not just more accessible for the researchers, but also more relevant, since Unitree\u2019s robots are already being deployed by users around the world who are likely not aware of the security risks. For example, Makris is concerned that the <a href=\"https://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/news/nottinghamshire/news/news/2025/august/officers-testing-revolutionary-robot-dog/\" target=\"_blank\">Nottinghamshire police in the United Kingdom have begun testing a Unitree Go2</a>, which can be exploited by UniPwn. \u201cWe tried contacting them and would have disclosed the vulnerability upfront to them before going public, but they ignored us. What would happen if an attacker implanted themselves into one of these police dogs?\u201d</p><h2>How to Secure Unitree Robots</h2><p>In the short term, Mayoral-Vilches suggests that people using Unitree robots can protect themselves by connecting the robots to only isolated Wi-Fi networks and disabling their Bluetooth connectivity. \u201cYou need to hack the robot to secure it for real,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not uncommon and why security research in robotics is so important.\u201d</p><p>Both Mayoral-Vilches and Makris believe that fundamentally it\u2019s up to Unitree to make their robots secure in the long term, and that the company needs to be much more responsive to users and security researchers. But Makris says: \u201cThere will never be a 100 percent secure system.\u201d</p><p>Mayoral-Vilches agrees: \u201cRobots are very complex systems, with wide attack surfaces to protect, and a state-of-the-art humanoid exemplifies that complexity.\u201d</p><p>Unitree, of course, is not the only company offering complex state-of-the-art quadrupeds and humanoids, and it seems likely (if not inevitable) that similar exploits will be discovered in other platforms. The <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/navigating-the-dual-use-dilemma\" target=\"_blank\">potential consequences</a> here can\u2019t be overstated\u2014the idea that robots can be taken over and used for nefarious purposes is already a science-fiction trope, but the impact of a high-profile robot hack on the reputation of the commercial robotics industry is unclear. Robots companies are barely talking about security in public, despite how damaging even the <em><em>perception</em></em> of an unsecured robot might be. A robot that is not under control has the potential to be a real physical danger.</p><p>For the <a href=\"https://2025humanoids.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Humanoids Conference</a> in Seoul from 30 September to 2 October, Mayoral-Vilches has organized <a href=\"https://aliasrobotics.com/cs4r_3.php\" target=\"_blank\">a workshop on Cybersecurity for Humanoids</a>, where he will present a brief (coauthored with Makris and Finisterre) titled <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14139v2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Humanoid Robots as Attack Vectors</a>. Despite the title, their intent is not to overhype the problem but instead to encourage roboticists (and robotics companies) to take security seriously, and not treat it as an afterthought. As Mayoral-Vilches points out, \u201cRobots are only safe if secure.\u201d</p><p><em>Story updated 29 Sep 2025 with statement released by Unitree.</em></p>"

The area had about 28 small semiconductor companies at the time, many launched from the nanofabrication facility housed at University of California, Santa Barbara, where John works. But as these companies expand, \u201cthey are all headhunting the same 10 people, basically,\u201d John says.</p><p>\u201cIt really was hindering their ability to scale. When you start up a company, you might have five or six highly educated people,\u201d he says. \u201cAs [companies] get bigger and they go beyond the research devices, they really need technicians to start making more chips.\u2026 That\u2019s where they often had these problems.\u201d</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>Now, following the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-map\" target=\"_self\">CHIPS and Science Act</a> of 2022 and increasing investment from companies like Intel and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona\" target=\"_self\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.</a>, the United States is expecting a shortage of workers who can staff new facilities. In the next few years, tens of thousands of additional skilled workers will be needed across the semiconductor industry; in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/reimagining-labor-to-close-the-expanding-us-semiconductor-talent-gap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey & Co. estimated</a> a talent gap between 59,000 and 146,000 engineers and technicians before the end of the decade. As the United States invests in reshoring chip manufacturing, the industry faces a dilemma: How can the semiconductor workforce scale to meet the coming demand?</p><p>Efforts to develop a strong workforce have grown, for example with government-funded initiatives from the Microelectronics Commons, a U.S. Department of Defense program that established eight hubs across the country to bridge research and manufacturing. (The National Semiconductor Technology Center was also established by the CHIPS Act in part for workforce development. However, in late August, the Commerce Department <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/natcast\" target=\"_self\">revoked funding from the nonprofit</a> that was set up to administer the program.) Through a combination of federal programs, state funding, and private-sector partnerships, U.S. colleges and universities are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-workforce-development\" target=\"_self\">working to increase talent</a>.</p><p>To fill the gap, some universities\u2014including UC Santa Barbara\u2014are also offering microcredential programs separate from <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-design-enrollment\" target=\"_self\">traditional degree programs</a>. In these bite-size courses, which can be as short as a week or two, future engineers and technicians can gain critical hands-on experience in clean-room fundamentals or an introduction to topics like lithography or etching. Deploying short, standardized, and skill-based courses across the country could be an essential part of building a sustainable U.S. semiconductor workforce.</p><h2>Developing Microcredentials</h2><p>UC Santa Barbara launched its clean-room training in 2021, opening the university\u2019s clean room to enrolled students as well as those from outside the university, including community college students and people looking to make a career change. Many universities already have clean rooms where they teach undergraduates about semiconductor fabrication, but students outside of a four-year degree program typically can\u2019t access these facilities to gain the necessary training.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big mismatch in culture between companies and city colleges and universities. They all want to solve the same problem, but they don\u2019t actually understand each other\u2019s needs that well,\u201d John says. To him, the importance of these courses is in aligning the needs of the industry, students, and educational institutions.</p><p>While developing the UC Santa Barbara course, however, John was surprised to find there was no established educational standard for those wishing to enter the semiconductor workforce outside of a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Scientist in cleanroom suit handling silicon wafers in a semiconductor manufacturing facility.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e44fd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/scientist-in-cleanroom-suit-handling-silicon-wafers-in-a-semiconductor-manufacturing-facility.png?id=61607711&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A student at UC Santa Barbara loads wafers into a machine used for plasma etching. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ben Werner</small></p><p>Since then, he has collaborated with several other institutions and organizations working to implement a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-microcredential-program-2671959389\" target=\"_self\">microcredential program developed by IEEE</a> in partnership with the University of Southern California (USC) as part of <a href=\"https://dreamsgold.org/ieee-micro-credentials/\" target=\"_blank\">California DREAMS (Defense Ready Electronics and Microdevices Superhub)</a>, funded by the DOD. Other programs also offer short training courses, but the standardization IEEE aims to provide is important for ensuring participants\u2019 skills are widely recognized by employers across the country.</p><p>Initially, John aimed to address the shortage of technicians to help companies scale up production. But as the courses have expanded elsewhere, it has become clear that the same hands-on experience can be used for engineering students as well.</p><p>Students who take these introductory courses may go on to join the workforce or continue in their education to a bachelor\u2019s or advanced degree. \u201cThe entire ladder of different workforce exits into the semiconductor industry is really important,\u201d says John. The industry needs operators and technicians, who may seek employment right after high school, as well as Ph.D.-level engineers. \u201cThese microcredentials get somebody into the start of that workforce ladder.\u201d</p><h2>What the Semiconductor Industry Needs</h2><p>Microcredentials assure employers that applicants have the skills needed to work in their fabs. A common misconception is that companies need students who have already been taught how to build their particular technology. But \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter exactly which specific device you made. What matters is that this person has had the experience of making some real chip,\u201d John says. He compares it to carpentry: Someone who has spent time in a woodshop making furniture may not know how to frame a house, but \u201call the tools are basically the same. I know they can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>So, in addition to specific skills, the course demonstrates a student\u2019s ability to learn the processes\u2014and tolerate the environment. With its loud machines, safety procedures, and protective bunny suits, the clean room isn\u2019t a typical workplace. Having students experience that environment lowers the risk of employers hiring someone who dislikes it.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter exactly which specific device you made. What matters is that this person has had the experience of making some real chip.\u201d <strong>\u2014Demis John</strong></p><p>The course has students spend several days in a clean room, which is more likely than a single clean-room day to filter out participants who wouldn\u2019t last. That\u2019s important for companies that invest a lot of resources in hiring and training new people, notes the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/darickbaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Darick Baker</a>, who serves as acting director of the Washington Nanofabrication Facility, in Seattle. </p><h2>Can Hands-On Courses Scale Up?</h2><p>The hands-on experience is a critical part of semiconductor microcredential programs, because companies want employees who are excited about building things. But it also inherently limits how many students can enroll at once. \u201cIf I can handle 12 students at a time, maybe there\u2019s the pathway to 100 students a year. But that\u2019s not the numbers we need,\u201d says Baker.</p><p>Instead, scalability will likely come from offering courses more frequently, and at more universities. Many universities already have a clean room and courses for university students, John says, so the goal was to make it easy for universities to adapt programs already in place to fit with the microcredential program. This also requires training of the instructors. USC, for example, offers a microcredential for instructors themselves in a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d model.</p><p>For 10 years, Baker has run clean-room training courses during which students make a diode. He became excited about the possibility of awarding students IEEE\u2019s professional microcredentials as a way to give students an advantage in the job market.</p><p>Baker visited USC and UC Santa Barbara to observe their programs and realized they were already quite similar to his. With a few small changes, he could make his program meet the requirements for IEEE microcredentials. His hope is that \u201csomebody can look at that credential and say, maybe this person doesn\u2019t know everything about working at a fab, but they spent one week gowned-up in a bunny suit. They\u2019re not going to quit in that first month because they can\u2019t handle being in the lab.\u201d</p><p>Currently, these programs may have significance mostly to local employers. But \u201cnationally, it starts to take meaning when you have a critical mass of universities that are offering these credentials,\u201d says Baker. \u201cThe more universities we can get on board with this, the more meaning that credential has.\u201d</p>"
