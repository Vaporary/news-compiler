        "summary": "This paper shows the key, yet overlooked, role played by the legacy of a high inflation history on the strength of the monetary policy response to inflationary shocks. To rationalize this, we propose a New Keynesian model that diverges from the existing workhorse model by adding path-dependence (to a forward-looking model) and potentially imperfect central bank credibility. We show that achieving low inflation (hitting the target) requires more aggressive monetary policy reactions, and is costlier from an output point of view, when individuals\u2019 past inflationary experiences shape their inflation expectation formation. In turn, we provide empirical evidence of the need for these two theoretical additions. Countries that experienced a high level of inflation before adopting the IT regime tend to respond more aggressively to deviations of inflation expectations from the central bank\u2019s target. We also point to the existence of a credibility puzzle, whereby the strength of a central bank\u2019s monetary policy response to deviations from the inflation target remains broadly unchanged even as central banks gain credibility over time. Put differently, a country\u2019s inflationary past casts a long and persistent shadow on central banks."

        "summary": "We use a novel dataset of production costs, wholesale prices, and retail prices from a large global manufacturer to study markups and pricing behavior along the supply chain. We document several facts about markups covering the period July 2018 through June 2023, and we propose a model of supply chain pricing behavior that rationalizes key pat-terns in our data. We find substantial dispersion in markups across products at each supply chain level. Manufacturer and retail markups are negatively correlated in the cross section and over time. Despite time-series variation in firm-level markups, total markups\u2014reflecting the relationship between retail prices and production costs\u2014are stable over time, even when prices increased along with inflation in the United States in 2022. We apply our model to quantify factors that determine relative bargaining power between the manufacturer and retailers, leveraging variation across countries, products, and time. Finally, we consider the dynamics of cost pass-through and the mediating role of manufacturer-retailer bargaining in price dynamics, with implications for current policy debates, including trade policy and tariffs."

        "summary": "Recent research finds that the shelter component of CPI inflation responds with a lag to movements in market rents\u2014the rents that tenants pay when they move into a new dwelling. This paper seeks to improve our understanding of this fact. We start by identifying three sources of lags between market rents and CPI shelter: the rents of most tenants are set in long-term leases; rents are smoothed for continuing tenants who renew leases; and CPI shelter inflation is measured with rent changes over six months. We incorporate these lags in a model of shelter inflation and compare the model to monthly data since 2015, using the Zillow Observed Rent Index to measure market rents. We find that the model performs fairly well, suggesting that it may be useful for understanding and forecasting inflation."

(iii) Monetary policy leaves fiscal footprints, even with passive fiscal policy. (iv) Fewer controversies around active fiscal policy. (v) Equilibria are unique under a wider class of fiscal and monetary rules. (vi) With short-term debt, raising nominal rates without a fiscal contraction raises inflation. (vii) Unfunded fiscal stimulus is more inflationary. (viii) Even fully funded fiscal stimulus is inflationary. (ix) Fiscal transfers can substitute for monetary policy in the aggregate."

In 1983 he published a pivotal paper introducing the k-trajectory formulation, a mathematical approach to tracking the path an MRI system follows as it collects data to reconstruct an image. The technology\u2019s researchers quickly adopted his method and used it to improve MRI machines\u2019 imaging speed, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>After earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics in 1971 from <a href=\"https://www.rice.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rice University</a>, in Houston, Twieg had a brief stint as an associate engineer at <a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Boeing</a> in Huntsville, Ala. He decided to continue his education, and in 1977 he earned a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from <a href=\"https://www.smu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Southern Methodist University</a>, in Dallas.</p><p>That year he joined the <a href=\"https://www.utdallas.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Texas at Dallas</a> as an associate professor of radiology. He made contributions there to cardiovascular nuclear medicine, including diagnostic tests to measure cardiac function.</p><p>In the early 1980s, Twieg changed his research focus to MRI technology. He left the university and joined the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_Natuurkundig_Laboratorium\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Philips research laboratory</a> in Aachen, Germany, as a staff scientist.

The directives, delivered via a set of four executive orders, set ambitious goals, such as having <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/reinvigorating-the-nuclear-industrial-base/\" target=\"_blank\">10 new large reactors</a> under construction by 2030, and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission/\" target=\"_blank\">overhauling the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (NRC).</p><p>One <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/deploying-advanced-nuclear-reactor-technologies-for-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\">particularly eager provision</a> instructs the U.S. Department of Energy to designate, within 90 days, at least one site on DOE-controlled land for the deployment of an advanced nuclear reactor\u2014a nearly impossible deadline that\u2019s coming up August 21.</p><p>The orders sparked a flurry of discussion across the nuclear industry and sent stakeholders scrambling. Experts weighed the promise of accelerated nuclear deployments against the potential of losing regulatory integrity. Whether the U.S. government, military, and industry stakeholders can meet the demands of the directives and timelines is unclear.</p><p>As someone with deep expertise in nuclear project development and licensing, I\u2019ve chosen to focus this article on the 90-day site-selection directive\u2014perhaps the first litmus test to see if the Trump administration will execute on its challenging deadlines.<strong> </strong></p><p>The process for selecting a site for a new nuclear plant in the United States is an arduous and complex process that blends engineering feasibility, environmental science, safety, emergency planning, economics, and public trust, all while complying with regulations and guidance. It\u2019s never been done in 90 days, at least not with regulatory approval.</p><p>But there might be one way for the DOE to meet that deadline: Rely on sites that are already deeply prepared with existing documentation and few unknowns. There are two locations in the United States that come close to fitting this category: <a href=\"https://inl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho National Laboratory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>.</p><h2>How to Pick a Site for an Advanced Nuclear Reactor</h2><p>To host a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States, a site must first receive a license from the NRC. To get that license, reactor owners typically take a couple of years to prepare the application, 6 to 12 months of which is needed to perform and document the site-selection process. The regulator then reviews the application and performs an environmental impact statement (EIS)\u2014a process that historically took more than two years, but is <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/29/2025-09798/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission\" target=\"_blank\">now required to be completed in 18 months, per new directives</a>.</p><p>The first step in selecting a site is to identify the region of interest. Next, unsuitable or problematic parts of that region, such as those that are prone to earthquakes, flooding, or landslides, are eliminated.</p><p>Remaining areas of land in the region are then assessed for technical and environmental suitability. For a small modular reactor (SMR), a type of advanced nuclear reactor, an ideal site size is a couple of hundred acres (about 80 hectares), while a thousand acres (over 400 ha) is ideal for a large nuclear plant. Reactors also need sufficient cooling water, which typically comes from a nearby ocean, lake, river, or aquafer.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Pushes $900 Million for Small Modular Reactor</a></p><p>Developers must assess the nearby population and infrastructure, search for endangered species, and assess wetlands. Business factors are also considered, such as distance to interconnection with transmission, cost to install and operate cooling, and the amount of site grading needed.</p><p>Finally, applicants assign weighting values to the criteria and rate sites against the various parameters. This iterative process, followed by further field investigations and narrowing of options, leads to the selection of one preferred site, with two to four others defined as alternatives. After that, the NRC reviews the application and proceeds with the environmental impact statement process.</p><h2>DOE\u2019s Looming Site-Selection Deadline</h2><p>It\u2019s unclear how far along the DOE is in its attempt to comply with the executive order\u2019s 90-day challenge to pick a site for a nuclear plant. Meeting the deadline will require creative thinking and decisive action.</p><p>With that in mind, the best path forward for the DOE is to focus on sites that have already undergone National Environmental Policy Act review and some NRC licensing. The DOE\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=Idaho+National+Lab\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho National Laboratory</a> (INL) in Idaho Falls, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=oak+ridge+national+Lab\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) in Tennessee, both meet those criteria.</p><p>Near INL, there are two options: the site where <a href=\"https://www.nuscalepower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NuScale Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uamps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems</a> were pursuing an NRC license for an SMR facility before <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactors-nuscale\" target=\"_blank\">abandoning the project</a> in November 2023, and the site proposed for the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/fc/areva-eagle-rock-lc.html\" target=\"_blank\">Eagle Rock uranium enrichment facility</a> that received a license in 2011 but was not constructed.</p><p>INL has hosted <a href=\"https://inl.gov/history/52-reactors/#:~:text=Nuclear%20Heritage,square%2Dmile%20site%20since%201949.\" target=\"_blank\">52 reactors since 1949</a>, so it\u2019s likely a suitable place from an environmental and safety perspective. Although both the NuScale and Eagle Rock sites meet the intent of the executive order, neither received an environmental impact statement from the NRC for a new nuclear reactor. Further, the Eagle Rock site is adjacent to INL, not on its site.</p><p>Perhaps the ideal choice is the 935-acre (378-ha) parcel of land on a peninsula on the Clinch River in Tennessee, adjacent to ORNL. The site is federally owned, currently controlled by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is the only site in the United States that has received a green light\u2014an early site permit from the NRC\u2014for SMRs.</p><p>The Clinch River site was partially developed in the 1970s for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor project, a liquid-metal fast breeder reactor that was abandoned in the early 1980s. The NRC in 2019 licensed the site to TVA for the construction and operation of two or more SMRs. This <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1935/ML19352D868.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">permit</a> allows for up to 800 megawatts electric (MWe) of nuclear power and followed a thorough environmental and safety review that remains valid through 2039.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An illustration imagines what the TVA BWRX-300 SMR as a large white building and electrical equipment surrounded by lush green forests and land, with a river and city in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5f2ff\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-imagines-what-the-tva-bwrx-300-smr-as-a-large-white-building-and-electrical-equipment-surrounded-by-lush-green-f.jpg?id=61421173&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A small modular reactor called the BWRX-300, developed by GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy, is planned for the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s Clinch River site.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">TVA </small></p><p>In May this year, <a href=\"https://www.tva.com/news-media/releases/tva-submits-nation-s-first-construction-permit-application-for-bwrx-300-smr\" target=\"_blank\">TVA requested a construction permit</a> to build on that site an SMR called the <a href=\"https://www.gevernova.com/nuclear/carbon-free-power/bwrx-300-small-modular-reactor\" target=\"_blank\">BWRX-300</a>, a boiling-water reactor, which would have a capacity of 300 MWe. But the site can accommodate additional SMRs and other advanced or microreactor units, which would fulfill the executive order\u2019s objectives.</p><h2>Clinch River Is Ideal for New Nuclear</h2><p>TVA was prescient in its thinking: Its stated objectives for the Clinch River site include powering mission-critical electricity loads for national defense, which aligns with the executive order\u2019s priorities. In fact, TVA\u2019s 2016 application assessed underground transmission lines to serve mission-critical loads on ORNL\u2014a design feature that makes it less susceptible to intentional destructive acts and natural phenomena such as tornadoes.</p><p>The area already hosts the DOE\u2019s largest electricity user, the <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/tema/prepare/technical-hazards/department-of-energy/about-the-oak-ridge-reservation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge Reservation</a>, which includes ORNL and the <a href=\"https://www.y12.doe.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Y-12 National Security Complex</a>, where nuclear-weapons components are manufactured and highly enriched uranium is stored and processed. Historically, the region supported the K-25 uranium-enrichment facility, which consumed, until the 1980s, more than 1,000 MWe. Today, the robust power infrastructure built to serve K-25 remains available in Oak Ridge, including redundant 161- and 500-kilovolt  transmission lines that transect the Clinch River site.</p><p>East Tennessee is also home to one of the nation\u2019s deepest and most experienced nuclear workforces, with TVA, DOE, the University of Tennessee, and many private-sector nuclear companies including <a href=\"https://www.centrusenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Centrus Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://kairospower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kairos Power</a>, <a href=\"https://laseristech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LIS Technologies</a>, <a href=\"https://nanonuclearenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Nuclear Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.orano.group/usa/en/our-news/news-releases/2025/orano-opens-project-ike-office-in-oak-ridge-tennessee-to-support-developing-its-american-uranium-enrichment-facility\" target=\"_blank\">Orano</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.standardnuclear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Nuclear</a>, <a href=\"https://typeoneenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Type One Energy</a>, and <a href=\"https://x-energy.com/fuel/triso-x\" target=\"_blank\">X-Energy</a>, plus numerous smaller suppliers, all calling Oak Ridge home.</p><p>TVA has not, thus far, catered to data centers\u2014one of the Trump administration\u2019s priorities. But on 24 July the DOE named the Oak Ridge Reservation one of four locations where it will invite private-sector partners to <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-site-selection-ai-data-center-and-energy-infrastructure-development-federal\" target=\"_blank\">develop cutting-edge AI data-center and energy-generation projects</a>. An adjacent advanced-nuclear plant on the Clinch River site would pair nicely.</p><h2>TVA\u2019s New Nuclear Constraints</h2><p>This rare combination of attributes simply doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere, and makes the Clinch River site the ideal location to try to meet the provisions in the executive orders. But several challenges lie ahead.</p><p>TVA\u2019s status as a federally owned corporation comes with constraints that impede progress. Namely, a US $30 billion cap on the amount of debt it can take on was bestowed upon it through the <a href=\"https://www.tva.com/about-tva/our-history/the-tva-act\" target=\"_blank\">TVA Act</a> and hasn\u2019t been increased since 1979. TVA has been <a href=\"https://www.powermag.com/americas-nuclear-renaissance-how-the-tva-can-lead-our-energy-future/\" target=\"_blank\">accused of moving too slowly</a> in the development of advanced nuclear and SMRs, and Tennessee senators and the president have called for leadership change at the power provider.</p><p>Successful execution of the directive will require leadership within the Trump administration. It will require TVA to seek creative solutions and overcome its constraints. One option would be to transfer the Clinch River site and its permit from TVA to the DOE. Or perhaps the simplest solution is for the DOE to contract for power in a manner that enables third-party financing of new nuclear capacity, so that the debt doesn\u2019t fall on TVA\u2019s balance sheet.</p><p>Given the urgency, importance, and magnitude of the challenge of meeting the United States\u2019 growing electricity needs and to accomplish the intent of the executive orders<strong>,</strong> DOE should designate <em><em>both</em></em> INL and ORNL as locations to host new nuclear reactors.</p>"

In a world where technology is increasingly integrated into every aspect of our lives\u2014from industrial robots to autonomous vehicles\u2014the potential for harm from product malfunctions makes functional safety not just important, but critical. </span></p><p>This webinar cuts through the complexity to provide a clear understanding of what functional safety truly entails and why it\u2019s critical for product success. We\u2019ll start by defining functional safety not by its often-confusing official terms, but as a structured methodology for managing risk through defined engineering processes, essential product design requirements, and probabilistic analysis. The \u201cnorth star\u201d goals? To ensure your <span>product not only works reliably but, if it does fail, it does so in a safe and predictable manner.</span></p><p>We\u2019ll dive into two fundamental concepts: the <span>Safety Lifecycle, a detailed engineering process focused on design quality to minimize systematic failures, and Probabilistic, Performance-Based Design using reliability metrics to minimize random hardware failures. You\u2019ll learn about IEC 61508, the foundational standard for functional safety, and how numerous industry-specific standards derive from it.</span></p><p>The webinar will walk you through the Engineering Design phases: analyzing hazards and required <span>risk reduction, realizing optimal designs, and ensuring safe operation. We\u2019ll demystify the Performance Concept and the critical Safety Integrity Level (SIL), explaining its definition, criteria (systematic capability, architectural constraints, PFD), and how it relates to industry-specific priorities.</span></p><p>Discover key Design Verification techniques like DFMEA/DDMA and FMEDA, emphasizing how these tools help identify and address problems early in development. We\u2019ll detail the <span>FMEDA technique showing how design decisions directly impact predictions like safe and dangerous failure rates, diagnostic coverage, and useful life. Finally, we\u2019ll cover Functional Safety Certification, explaining its purpose, process, and what adjustments to your development process can set you up for success.</span></p><p><span><span><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/749990?utm_source=Wiley&amp;utm_medium=Spectrum\" target=\"_blank\">Register now for this free webinar!</a></span></span></p>"

Those videos inspired him to enroll in the engineering program at <a href=\"https://aiht.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Anand Institute of Higher Technology</a>, in Chennai. During his second year there, a career in engineering won out over one in entertainment. His engineering career has had its challenges, however.</p><p>Today, Pandy is an application development manager at <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a>, in Richmond, Va.

Today\u2019s young adults want everything instantly\u2014which isn\u2019t realistic in the workplace. </li><li>Keep learning. Today\u2019s technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are evolving quickly, and you need to stay on top of the latest innovations. </li><li>Don\u2019t wait for the perfect opportunity; rather, create it. </li><li>Don\u2019t view yourself as \u201cjust\u201d a software engineer or \u201cjust\u201d an associate engineer. Go the extra mile, even if you aren\u2019t paid to do so. That way, you\u2019ll always be one step ahead of the competition. </li><li>Build solutions that will have a real-world impact, not just theoretical value. Theoretical value is good to study, but make the application practical. When you do practical work, you\u2019ll come to know the difficulties, the failures, and the pros and cons.</li><li>Staying true to yourself will help you grow in your career.</li><li>Stay humble, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they are silly.</li><li>Get involved in a professional organization, such as IEEE, early in your career. You\u2019ll get to know about cutting-edge technologies, meet great leaders, and pick up skills that will help your career.</li></ul><p><span>\u201cIEEE stays updated on the frontier of technologies and gives back to the engineering community,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt also provides services to students and initiates talks where we can explore topics with respect to our skills and knowledge, and mentor others.\u201d</span></p><p>Interested in volunteering and mentoring, he decided to nominate himself for the position of IEEE Richmond Section chair. The section has more than 800 members and covers six cities and 26 counties.</p><p>Being chair is his first volunteer leadership position. He says he believed that running the section would enhance his leadership skills. Winning the election \u201cwas a miracle,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was another enrichment opportunity for my career.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/about/excom-2/\" target=\"_blank\">He began his term in January</a> and was initially anxious about the additional workload, he says, but so far his term has been an \u201camazing experience.\u201d He credits IEEE Senior Member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenjjones/\" target=\"_blank\">Allen Jones</a>, a past chair of the section, for helping him through the transition.</p><p>Pandy has been busy since taking office. The section formed a <a href=\"https://life.ieee.org/volunteers/life-members-affinity-groups/\" target=\"_blank\">life members affinity group</a> and has held events with the <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/vcu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Virginia Commonwealth University student branch</a> in Richmond. The section also held <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/leadership-skills-ieee-courses\" target=\"_blank\">career-development</a> events there, allowing IEEE members to mentor engineering students, provide them with networking tips, and help them refine their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://ieeemagnetics.org/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Magnetics Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society</a> chapters partnered with VCU, <a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI Ready RVA</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ritsva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Richmond Institute of Technology and Science</a> to increase<a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> artificial intelligence literacy for preuniversity students in underserved communities</a>. The initiative provides training to educators and offers workshops to students demonstrating the technology and its practical applications.</p><p>Through leading all those activities, Pandy says, he has picked up important skills including strategic planning, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5-tips-technical-presentations\" target=\"_blank\">public speaking</a>, team collaboration, and budget planning, which he can apply at work.</p><p>\u201cThese experiences have helped me drive large-scale IT transformation projects in my professional role,\u201d he says, \u201cand improved my ability to lead diverse and cross-functional teams.</p><p>\u201cVolunteering fuels my energy rather than drains it. Also, it\u2019s kind of a small, rewarding part of my weekly routine. I feel that I\u2019ve done a little bit to help someone somewhere move a step ahead in their career\u2014which gives me great satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Pandy hasn\u2019t lost his desire to be an entertainer. He performs whenever possible at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeZ2sFI74Do\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cultural events</a> and the section\u2019s social gatherings.</p><p>\u201cDancing and acting are now hobbies,\u201d he says.</p>"

The standard was a result of a <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 memorandum</a> from the Biden administration that requires federal agencies to transition to PQC-based security by 2035.</p><p>Cryptography relies on math problems that are nearly impossible to solve, but easy to check if a solution is correct. Armed with such math problems, only the holder of a secret key can check their solution and get access to the secret data. Today, most online cryptography relies on one of two such algorithms: either <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rsa-token-replacement-a-slow-process\" target=\"_blank\">RSA</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography\" target=\"_blank\">elliptic curve cryptography</a>.</p><p>The cause for concern is that quantum computers, if a large enough one is ever built, would make easy work of the \u201chard\u201d problems underlying current cryptographic methods. Luckily, there are other math problems that appear to be equally hard for quantum computers and their existing classical counterparts. That\u2019s the basis of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2667758178\" target=\"_blank\">post-quantum cryptography</a>: cryptography that\u2019s secure against hypothetical quantum computers.</p><p>With the mathematics behind PQC ironed out, and standards in hand, the work of adoption is now underway. This is no easy feat: every computer, laptop, smartphone, self-driving car, or IoT device will have to fundamentally change the way they run cryptography.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ali.elkaafarani\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ali El Kaafarani</a> is a research fellow at the Oxford Mathematical Institute who contributed to the development of NIST\u2019s PQC standards. He also founded a company, <a href=\"https://pqshield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PQShield</a>, to help bring post-quantum cryptography into the real world by assisting original equipment manufacturers in implementing the new protocols. He spoke with <em>IEEE Spectrum <strong></strong><strong></strong></em><span>about</span> how adoption is going and whether the new standards will be implemented in time to beat the looming threat of quantum computers.</p><p><strong>What has changed in the industry since the NIST PQC standards came out?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait photograph of Ali El Kaafarani, dark haired man with a beard, a mustache and glasses\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"65f9b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-photograph-of-ali-el-kaafarani-dark-haired-man-with-a-beard-a-mustache-and-glasses.jpg?id=61455658&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ali El Kaafarani</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">PQShield</small></p><p><strong>Ali El Kaafarani</strong>: Before the standards came out, a lot of people were not talking about it at all, in the spirit of \u201cIf it\u2019s working, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d Once the standards were published, the whole story changed, because now it\u2019s not hypothetical quantum hype, it\u2019s a compliance issue. There are standards published by the U.S. government. There are deadlines for the adoption. And the 2035 [deadline] came together with the publication from [the National Security Agency], and was adopted in formal legislation that passed Congress and therefore there is no way around it. Now it\u2019s a compliance issue.</p><p>Before, people used to ask us, \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer. But that\u2019s the issue, because we\u2019re talking about a risk that can materialize any time. Some other, more intelligent people who have access to a wider range of information decided in 2015 to categorize quantum computing as a real threat. So this year was a transformational year, because the question went from \u201cWhy do we need it?\u201d to \u201cHow are we going to use it?\u201d And the whole supply chain started looking into who\u2019s going to do what, from chip design to the network security layer, to the critical national infrastructure, to build up a post-quantum-enabled network security kit.</p><h2>Challenges in PQC Implementation</h2><p><strong>What are some of the difficulties of implementing the NIST standards?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> You have the beautiful math, you have the algorithms from NIST, but you also have the wild west of cybersecurity. That infrastructure goes from the smallest sensors and car keys, etc., to the largest server sitting there and trying to crunch hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, each with different security requirements, each with different energy consumption requirements. Now that is a different problem. That\u2019s not a mathematical problem, that\u2019s an implementation problem. This is where you need a company like PQShield, where we gather hardware engineers, and firmware engineers, and software engineers, and mathematicians, and everyone else around them to actually say, \u201cWhat can we do with this particular use case?\u201d</p><p>Cryptography is the backbone of cybersecurity infrastructure, and worse than that, it\u2019s the invisible piece that nobody cares about until it breaks. If it\u2019s working, nobody touches it. They only talk about it when there\u2019s a breach, and then they try to fix things. In the end, they usually put bandaids on it. That\u2019s normal, because enterprises can\u2019t sell the security feature to the customers. They were just using it when governments force them, like when there\u2019s a compliance issue. And now it\u2019s a much bigger problem, as someone is telling them, \u201cYou know what, all the cryptography that you\u2019ve been using for the past 15 years, 20 years, you need to change it, actually.\u201d</p><p><strong>Are there security concerns for the PQC algorithm implementations?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> Well, we haven\u2019t done it before. It hasn\u2019t been battle-tested. And now what we\u2019re saying is, \u201cHey, AMD and the rest of the hardware or semiconductor world go and put all those new algorithms in hardware, and trust us, they\u2019re going to work fine, and then nobody\u2019s going to be able to hack them and extract the key.\u201d That\u2019s not easy, right? Nobody has the guts to say this.</p><p>That\u2019s why, at PQShield, we have vulnerability teams that are trying to break our own designs, separately from those teams who are designing things. You have to do this. You need to be one step ahead of attackers. That\u2019s all you need to do, and that\u2019s all you can do, because you can\u2019t say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got something that is secure. Nobody can break it.\u201d If you say that, you\u2019re going eat a humble pie in 10 years\u2019 time, because maybe someone will come up with a way to break it. You need to just do this continuous innovation and continuous security testing for your products.</p><p>Because PQC is new, we still haven\u2019t seen all the creativity of attackers trying to bypass the beautiful mathematics, and come up with those creative and nasty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\" target=\"_blank\">side-channel attacks</a> that just laugh at the mathematics. For example, some attacks look at the energy consumption the algorithm is taking on your laptop, and they extract the key from the differences in energy consumption. Or there are timing attacks that look at how long it takes for you to encrypt the same message 100 times and how that\u2019s changing, and they can actually extract the key. So there are different ways to attack algorithms there, and that\u2019s not new. We just don\u2019t have billions of these devices in in our hands now that have post-quantum cryptography that people have tested.</p><h2>Progress in PQC Adoption</h2><p><strong>How would you say adoption has been going so far?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> The fact that a lot of companies only started when the standards were published, it puts us in a position where there are some that are well advanced in their thoughts and their processes and their adoption, and there are others that are totally new to it because they were not paying attention, and they were just kicking the can down the road. The majority of those who were kicking the can down the road are the ones that don\u2019t sit high up in the supply chain, because they felt like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s responsibility. But they didn\u2019t understand that they have they had to influence their suppliers when it comes to their requirements and timelines and integration and so many things that they have to prepare. This is what\u2019s going on now: A lot of them are doing a lot of work.</p><p>Now, those who sit high up in the supply chain, quite a few of them have made great progress and started embedding post-quantum cryptography designs into new products, and are trying to work out a way to upgrade products that are already on the ground.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re in in a great place, where everyone is doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. That\u2019s not the case. But I think that from last year, when many people were asking \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d and are now asking \u201cHow can I be compliant? Where do you think I should start? And how can I evaluate where the infrastructure to understand where the most valuable assets are, and how can I protect them? What influence can I exercise on my suppliers?\u201d I think huge progress has been made.</p><p>Is it enough? It\u2019s never enough in security. Security is damn difficult. It\u2019s a multi-disciplinary topic. There are two types of people: Those who love to build security products, and those who would love to break them. We\u2019re trying to get most of those who love to break them into the right side of history so that they can make products stronger rather than actually making existing ones vulnerable for exploitation.</p><p><strong>Do you think we\u2019re going to make it by 2035?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> I think that the majority of our infrastructure should be post quantum secure by 2035, and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s a good thought to have. Now, what happens if quantum computers happen to become reality before that? That\u2019s a good topic for a TV series or for a movie. What happens when most secrets are readable? People are not thinking hard enough about it. I don\u2019t think that anyone has an answer for that. <strong></strong></p>"

Growing up in India, he would take apart remote-controlled cars and use the motors and batteries to build something new.</p><p>No one in his family worked in science, technology, engineering, or math, he says, but science has always felt \u201ccompletely natural.\u201d</p><p>His fascination with STEM subjects deepened in high school, and his teachers fueled his passion. But it was M.R. Shenoy, a physics professor at the <a href=\"https://home.iitd.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>, who inspired him to pursue research in the semiconductor field.</p><p>As an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://www.mnnit.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology</a>, in Allahabad, India, Rudra took an online semiconductor optoelectronics certification course offered by NPTEL that was taught by Shenoy.</p><p>Motivated to gain experience in the field, from 2017 to 2019 Rudra completed several internships working on semiconductor fabrication at organizations including the <a href=\"https://iitbhu.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of technology (BHU)</a>, Varanasi; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology</a>, Kharagpur; and the <a href=\"https://www.ceeri.res.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute</a>.</p><p>\u201cThese internships were my first real exposure to experimental research and gave me a foundation in device physics and material science,\u201d he says.</p><p>He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communications engineering from MNNIT in 2019.</p><h2>Working in semiconductor fabrication and FinFET</h2><p>After graduating he became a research assistant at the <a href=\"https://iisc.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), in Bengaluru.</p><p>There he developed a thin film of manganese vanadium oxide using the epitaxy process. The method grows the manganese vanadium oxide on top of the crystal substrate\u2014which gives engineers more control over the film\u2019s thickness, composition, and crystal structure, according to <a href=\"https://www.photonics.com/EDU/epitaxial_deposition/d8286\" target=\"_blank\">Photonics Media</a>. Rudra used the film to develop a photodetector for infrared light.</p><p>After a year he joined semiconductor manufacturer <a href=\"https://gf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GlobalFoundries</a>, also in Bengaluru, as an integration and yield engineer. He continued his work at IISc on the weekends.</p><p>\u201cBefore joining, I had modest expectations\u2014largely because of the limited semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in India,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I realized that hardware-focused work was indeed happening in the industry. That experience planted the seed of transitioning from academia to cutting-edge industrial R&amp;D.\u201d</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cFor any young professional in STEM, IEEE isn\u2019t just a resource; it\u2019s a launchpad.\u201d</span></p><p><span></span>While at GlobalFoundries, he worked on BEOL interconnects to enhance the yield of the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-foundry-finfet\" target=\"_self\">FinFET</a> chips, which are used in automotive technology, smartphones, and smart speakers. In conventional planar transistors, the gate sits atop a flat silicon channel, controlling the flow of current between the source and drain from only one side. As transistors shrank in size, however, they became <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">less reliable and leaked current,</a> wasting power. FinFET development was led by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">Chenming Hu</a>, who received the 2020<a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for the invention. FinFET\u2019s 3D structure provides better control of the current.</p><p>In 2021 Rudra decided to continue his education and was accepted into the master\u2019s degree program in electrical and computer engineering at the <a href=\"https://odei.umich.edu/2023/10/19/university-of-michigan-celebrates-first-generation-college-students-during-week-long-events/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor.</p><p>\u201cI chose this school because there was a particular professor working on LED devices whose research really resonated with me,\u201d he says. The professor, <a href=\"https://mi.engin.umich.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Fellow Zetian Mi</a>, was working on III-V semiconductor optoelectronic devices. Rudra was part of Mi\u2019s research team for the first two semesters of his graduate program, working on the fabrication and characterization of III-Nitride-based microLEDs. Rudra also completed an internship at <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> in Redmond, Wash., where he developed integration processes for waveguide-based photonic devices for AR/VR systems.</p><p>\u201cThat experience helped me understand how photonics intersects with semiconductor manufacturing,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly in emerging applications like next-gen displays and wearable optics.\u201d</p><p>After earning his degree in 2023, he joined <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Semiconductor</a> in Austin, Texas, as a device integration engineer. There he returned to working on FinFETs, but this time analyzing and optimizing device and front-end-of-line integration for 14-nm node technology and how different processes affect the electrical performance and yield of FinFETs.</p><p>After a year, he left to join IBM Research.</p><p>\u201cBeing part of such a high-impact, globally collaborative initiative has been a fantastic experience and one that continues to push me technically and professionally,\u201d he says.</p><p>Since working at the company, he has filed 22 U.S. patents.</p><p>He received a slew of honors last year, including being named to<a href=\"https://www.semiconwest.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon West</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30 list, the<a href=\"https://www.sme.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Society of Manufacturing Engineers</a>\u2019s 30 Under 30, and<a href=\"https://www.semiconeuropa.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon Europa</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30.

He continues to renew his membership, he says, because of the networking opportunities it provides, as well as technical content that helps him stay up to date on semiconductors.</p><p>In addition to the IEEE Computer Society, he is an active member of the IEEE <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Electron Devices</a> (EDS), <a href=\"https://eps.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Electronics Packaging</a>, and<a href=\"https://ieeephotonics.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Photonics</a> societies. Each \u201cis home to a vibrant network of engineers, scientists, and innovators who are accomplished in their respective fields,\u201d Rudra says.</p><p>In 2022 he received an <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/education/student-fellowships/masters-student-fellowship\" target=\"_blank\">Electron Devices Society master\u2019s fellowship</a>, which awarded him $2,000 to use toward research within the society\u2019s fields of interest. Receiving the honor, he says, was a powerful motivator.</p><p>He is active with <a href=\"https://yp.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Young Professionals</a> and is a member of the Electron Devices Society\u2019s YP committee. Being a part of the community, he says, gives him access to world-class expertise and provides resources to help him make career decisions and solve technical challenges.</p><p>He is also a part of the organizing committee for this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/education/summer-schools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE EDS Summer School</a>, a two-day lecture program for university seniors, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young professionals.</p><p>\u201cFor any young professional in STEM, I believe IEEE isn\u2019t just a resource; it\u2019s a launchpad,\u201d Rudra says. \u201cGetting involved early helps you grow technically, professionally, and personally in a way few organizations can offer.\u201d</p>"

Nigeria\u2019s big telecom operators continue to build long-distance, high-capacity fiber-optic networks from the cables to the important commercial nodes in the cities. But distribution to the urban peripheries and to rural places such as Atan is still incomplete.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Incomplete is an understatement: <a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Less than half</a> of the country\u2019s 237 million people have regular access to broadband, with that access mostly happening through <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/statistics-reports/subscriber-data#monthly-subscriber-technology-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mobile devices</a> rather than more stable fixed connections. Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy has set a goal to almost double the length of the country\u2019s fiber-optic backbone and for broadband to reach <a href=\"https://fmcide.gov.ng/ministry-launches-national-broadband-alliance-for-nigeria-nban-to-drive-broadband-connectivity-and-infrastructure-development/\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent of the population</a> by the end of this year.

The broadband buildout has been seriously hampered by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nigeria-power-grid\" target=\"_blank\">Nigeria\u2019s unreliable power grid</a>.

On the other hand, streaming platforms made it easier for Nigerians to access foreign video content, cutting into local producers\u2019 market share.

Less than 1 percent of the 130 million Nigerians had phone lines in 2002, so the government established a second carrier, Globacom, to try to accelerate competition in the telecom market.</p><p>But a mixture of mismanagement and wider difficulties contributed to the sluggish spread of broadband, as<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\"> <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> reported in 2004</a>.

NTEL backs up the grid electricity with a battery bank and two generators.</p><h2>In Nigeria, mobile broadband is popular</h2><p>What is often missing in Nigeria is the local connection, the last few kilometers leading to customers. In the developed world, that connection works like this: Internet service providers (ISPs) plug into the nearest backbone via one of several technologies and deliver a small slice of bandwidth to their business and residential customers. A switching station called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence\" target=\"_blank\">point of presence</a> (PoP) serves as an on- and off-ramp between the backbone and the ISPs. The ISPs are responsible for installing the fiber-optic cables that lead to their customers; they may also use microwave antennas to beam a signal to customers.</p><p>But in Nigeria, fiber-optic ISPs have been sluggish to capture market share. Of the country\u2019s<a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/internet-service-operator-data\" target=\"_blank\"> 300,000 or so fixed-line broadband subscribers</a>\u2014just 0.001 percent of Nigerians\u2014about a third are served by the leading ISP, <a href=\"https://spectranet.com.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectranet</a>. By comparison, the average fixed broadband penetration rate among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/broadband-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\">42.5 percent in 2023</a>, led by South Korea, with 89.6 percent penetration. </p><p>Starlink\u2019s satellite-based service, <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2025/starlink-nigeria-internet-elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced in Nigeria in 2023</a>, is now the second biggest broadband ISP, with about 60,000 subscribers. That\u2019s almost triple the third biggest ISP, <a href=\"https://fob.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">FiberOne</a>. Satellite is outcompeting fiber because it\u2019s more reliable and has <a href=\"https://www.ookla.com/articles/starlink-ssa-q1-2025\" target=\"_blank\">higher speeds and tolerable latency</a>, even though it costs more. A Starlink satellite terminal can serve up to 200 subscribers and retails for about US $200 plus a $37 monthly fee. A comparable fiber-to-the-home plan in Abuja, where the median monthly take-home pay is $280, costs about $19 a month.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a row of color display cases holding cellphones, with signs offering phone and laptop repair.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"57d0f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-row-of-color-display-cases-holding-cellphones-with-signs-offering-phone-and-laptop-repair.jpg?id=61426635&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In Lagos\u2019s Computer Village, you can buy or sell a mobile phone or computer, or get yours repaired.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>Meanwhile, Nigeria has <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/subscriber-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">142 million cellular subscriptions</a>, and so most Internet users access the Internet wirelessly, via a mobile network. In other words, Nigeria\u2019s mobile market is nearly 500 times as big as the market for fixed broadband. The mobile networks also rely on the fiber-optic backbones, but instead of using PoP gateways, they link to cellular base stations, each of which can reach up to thousands of mobile devices but may not offer ideal quality of service. </p><p>Mobile Internet is a good thing for people who can afford it, which is<a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" target=\"_blank\"> most Nigerians</a>, according to the <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/\" target=\"_blank\">International Telecommunication Union</a>. The cost of fixed-line broadband is still around five times as much, which explains why its market share is so tiny. But mobile Internet isn\u2019t enough to run many businesses, nor do mobile network operators guarantee network speeds or low latency, which are crucial factors for high-frequency trading, telemedicine, and e-commerce, and for white-collar jobs requiring streaming video calls.</p><h2>Nigeria is 129th in the world in Internet speeds</h2><p>Internet speeds across Nigeria vary, but broadband tester Ookla\u2019s spring 2025 median for fixed broadband was 28 megabits per second for downloads and 15 Mb/s for uploads, with latency of 25 milliseconds. That puts Nigeria 129th in the world for fixed broadband. In May, Starlink delivered download speeds between 44 and 50 Mb/s, uploads of around 12 Mb/s, and latency of around 61 ms. The top country, <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/singapore\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore</a>, averaged 393 Mb/s down and 286 Mb/s up, with 4 ms latency. And those numbers for Nigeria don\u2019t capture the effect of unpredictable electricity cuts.</p><p><a href=\"https://nileuniversity.edu.ng/staff/professor-steve-a-adeshina/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve A. Adeshina</a>, a computer engineering professor and machine-vision expert at <a href=\"https://nileuniversity.edu.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">Nile University</a>, in the capital city of Abuja, says he routinely runs up against the limits of Nigeria\u2019s broadband network. That\u2019s why he keeps two personal cellular modems on his desk. His university contracts with several Internet providers, but the broadband in his lab is still intermittent. For machine-vision research, with its huge datasets, failing to upload data stored on his local machine to the more powerful cloud processor where he runs his experiments means failing to work. \u201cWe have optical fiber, but we are not getting value for money,\u201d Adeshina says.

The problem is so bad that in February, the government established a committee to prevent network blackouts due to cable cuts during road construction, which it blamed for 60 percent of the incidents.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is reaching the hinterland,\u201d Aliyu of Phase3 Telecom says, and keeping lines intact once there. To make his point, Aliyu, dressed in a snappy three-piece suit and red tie, drives a company pickup truck from Phase3\u2019s well-appointed offices in a leafy part of Abuja to a nearby ring road. He pulls over in the shade of an overpass and steps onto the dirt shoulder. A concrete manhole cover sits perched along one edge of an open manhole, looking like the lid of a sarcophagus.</p><p>Pointing at the hole, Aliyu explains how easy it is for local gangs, called area boys, to steal components or cut the cables, forcing backbone providers and ISPs to strike unofficial security deals with the boys, or the more powerful, shadowy men behind them. Of course, part of the problem is self-inflicted: Sloppy work crews leave manholes open and expose the cables to potential damage from nesting animals or a stray cigarette butt that ignites tumbleweed and melts the cables.</p><p>Phase3 and other telecom companies are also contending with the expense of replacing the first generation of fiber-optic cables, now about 20 years old, as well as upgrading PoP hardware to increase capacity. They\u2019re spending money not just to reach new customers, but also to provide competitive service to existing customers.</p><p>For mobile operators such as Globacom, there\u2019s the additional challenge of ensuring reliable power for their base stations. They often rely on diesel or gasoline generators to back up grid power, but fuel scarcity, infrastructure theft, and supply chain issues can undermine base station reliability.</p><h2>How Nigeria\u2019s offline half lives</h2><p>The hamlet of <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/553626-special-report-inside-abujas-forgotten-communities-lacking-basic-amenities-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tungan Ashere</a> is 3 km northwest of the major international airport serving Abuja. To get here, you leave the highway and drive past cinder-block huts with traditional reed roofs. The side of the dirt road is adorned with concrete pylons waiting to be strung with power lines but still naked as the day they were installed in 2021. People here farm cassava, watermelon, yam, and corn. Some keep small herds of goats and cattle.

The metal resonates, not quite like a church bell, but it serves a similar purpose. \u201cThe bell, it\u2019s to tell everybody to go to sleep, to wake up, if there\u2019s an announcement. It\u2019s an ancient way of communicating,\u201d explains Lukman Aliu, a telecom engineer who drove me here.</p><p>The concept of connectivity in the village differs from just a few kilometers away at the airport, where passengers can enjoy free high-speed Wi-Fi in the comfort of a caf\u00e9. Yet the potential benefits of affordable broadband access for people living in places like Tungan Ashere are enormous.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usman.isah.5205?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\" target=\"_blank\">Usman Isah Dandari</a> is trying to meet that need.

Dandari coordinates a handful of community networking projects, including one in Tungan Ashere. Better broadband here would help farmers track market prices, help students complete their homework, and make it easier for farmers and craftspeople to advertise their goods. CITAD uses a mixture of hardware, including Starlink terminals and cellular modems, to offer relatively reliable broadband to areas neglected by commercial operators. The group is also considering using Nigeria\u2019s national satellite operator, <a href=\"https://nigcomsat.gov.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">NigComSat</a>, and working with the Nigerian Communications Commission to lower the costs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a man in Nigerian garb standing in front of a seated group of mainly children who are looking at tablets.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10785\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-man-in-nigerian-garb-standing-in-front-of-a-seated-group-of-mainly-children-who-are-looking-at-tablets.jpg?id=61426661&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Usman Isah Dandari [standing] coordinates several projects like the one in Tungan Ashere, to provide affordable broadband access.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>A few meters away from the scrap-metal bell in Tungan Ashere is a one-story building painted rust red, topped with a pastel green corrugated metal roof and eight solar panels, which power a computer lab inside. There\u2019s no grid electricity here, but the solar panels are enough to run a CITAD-provided cellular modem, a few desktop computers, and a formidable floor fan some of the time.</p><p>Many of the people in the village once lived where the airport is now. The Nigerian government<a href=\"https://dailytrust.com/the-sad-story-of-communities-displaced-for-abuja-airport/\" target=\"_blank\"> displaced them</a> when it chose the region as the new federal capital territory in 1991. Since then, successive local governments have provided services piecemeal, usually in the runup to elections. The result is a string of communities like Tungan Ashere\u201410,000 people in all\u2014that still lack running water, paved roads, grid electricity, and reliable Internet. These people may live on the edge of Nigeria\u2019s broadband backbone, but they reap few of its benefits.</p><h2>A private undersea cable shows how to do it</h2><p>Not every undersea cable rollout has been fraught. In 2005, electrical engineer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funke_Opeke\" target=\"_blank\">Funke Opeke</a> was working at Verizon Communications in the United States. <a href=\"https://www.mtn.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">MTN</a>, an African telecom company, hired her to help it build its submarine cables. Then Nitel hired her to help manage its privatization. There, she saw up close how the organization was failing to get the Internet from SAT-3 into Nigerians\u2019 lives.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a woman seated at a table with her hands folded in front of her.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3565a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-woman-seated-at-a-table-with-her-hands-folded-in-front-of-her.jpg?id=61426663&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Funke Opeke founded MainOne to build Nigeria\u2019s first private undersea fiber-optic cable.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Osodi/Bloomberg/Getty Images</small></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a question of capital or return on investment, policy, or interest,\u201d Opeke says. Instead, officials favored suppliers offering kickbacks over those with competent bids.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity for a well-managed submarine cable, Opeke approached private investors about developing a cable of their own. The result is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_One\" target=\"_blank\">MainOne cable</a>, which arrived in Lagos in 2010 and is operated by the company of the same name. MainOne offered the first private competition to Nitel\u2019s SAT-3 and Globacom\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLO-1\" target=\"_blank\">Glo-1</a>, which began service in 2010. (MTN\u2019s two cables landed in Nigeria in 2011.)</p><p>At first, the MainOne cable suffered the same problem as the others\u2014its capacity wasn\u2019t reaching users. \u201cAfter we built, there was no distribution,\u201d Opeke, who\u2019s now an advisor with MainOne, says. So the company got its own ISP license and began building fiber links into major metro areas\u2014eventually <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/04/equinix-enters-africa-closing-the-us-320-million-acquisition-of-mainone\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,200 km</a> in states near its undersea-cable landing site. It ended up offering a more complete service than originally intended, bringing the Internet from overseas, onshore, across Nigeria, and the last kilometers into businesses and homes, and it attracted more than 800 business clients.</p><p>MainOne\u2019s success forced the publicly held telecoms and the mobile providers to compete. \u201cThe mobile networks were built for voice, and they were not investing fast enough\u201d in data capacity, Opeke says. MainOne did invest, helping to create the broadband capacity needed for Nigeria\u2019s first data centers. It then diversified into data centers, and in 2022 sold its whole business to American data-center giant <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Equinix</a>.</p><p>Other companies, including the major mobile operators, also began building fiber between Nigerian cities, duplicating each other\u2019s infrastructure. The problem is they didn\u2019t offer competitive prices to independent ISPs that wanted to piggyback on those new fiber-optic links, says the telecom analyst Odufuwa.</p><p>And neither the public sector nor the private sector is meeting the needs of Nigerians at the bottom of the market, especially in rural communities such as Tungan Ashere and Atan. A crucial first step will be to improve the reliability of the electrical grid, Opeke says, which will help drive down costs for telecom operators and other businesses, and create a virtuous cycle for further growth.</p><p>Almost everyone <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> interviewed for this story said security is another challenge: If Nigerian states and the federal government could ensure the security of the infrastructure, telecom operators would invest more in expanding their networks. Building telecom infrastructure is well within the reach of Nigerian engineers. \u201cNigeria doesn\u2019t have a skill problem,\u201d Opeke says. \u201cIt has an opportunity problem.\u201d</p><p>If the bureaucrats, businesspeople, and engineers can overcome those policy and technical hurdles, the unconnected half of Nigerians stand to gain a lot. Reliable broadband in Atan would draw more young people to agriculture, says the farmer and sociologist Bolaji Adeniyi: \u201cIt will provide jobs.\u201d Then, like Adeniyi, maybe those young connected Nigerians will reconsider whether farming is just father\u2019s work\u2014perhaps it could be their future, too. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Special thanks to IEEE Senior Member John Funso-Adebayo for his assistance with the logistics and reporting for this story. </em></p>"

The cost of the discharge damage can range from a few US cents for a simple diode to thousands of dollars for complex integrated circuits, according to the EOS/ESD Association. When factoring in revisions, labor, shipping, and overhead, the total cost to manufacturers can be substantial.</p><h2>A new ESD protection design program</h2><p>To equip engineers, technicians, and quality-assurance professionals with knowledge and tools to mitigate electrostatic discharge, IEEE has launched a <a href=\"https://innovate.ieee.org/esd-protection-design\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Practical ESD Protection Design</a> course and certificate program.<strong> </strong>The new training is suitable for individuals and organizations seeking to improve their ESD control.</p><p>The standards-based instruction is aligned with <a href=\"https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/ansi-esd-s20-20-2021-protection-electronic-parts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ANSI/ESD S20.20\u201321: Protection of Electrical and Electronic Parts</a> and other industry guidelines. The interactive modules cover theory, real-world case studies, and practical mitigation techniques.</p><p>\u201cAn understanding of ESD is valued in multiple areas, ranging from design to testing and handling equipment in the field,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachariah-peterson/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zachariah Peterson</a>, an IEEE member and ESD industry expert and executive consultant for <a href=\"https://www.nwengineeringllc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Northwest Engineering Solutions</a>, in Portland, Ore. </p><p>\u201cEquipment failure due to ESD results in more than just rework costs, the damage is also to a company\u2019s brand. The ability to anticipate ESD gives engineers a critical leg up in building reliable products and a durable business.\u201d</p><p>After successfully completing the training program, learners earn an IEEE certificate for 89 professional development hours and 8.9 continuing education units.</p><p>As the electronics industry evolves, the importance of ESD control is likely to increase. With the rise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-ai-training-mini-mba\" target=\"_self\">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-5g-and-6g-training\" target=\"_self\">5G</a>, and edge computing, the demand for high-performance, reliable chips is growing while the margin for error is shrinking.</p><p>The IEEE Practical ESD Protection Design program is not just a preventative measure; it\u2019s a strategic choice that can support innovation, quality, and long-term success.</p>"

Even a 50 percent productivity boost is amazing, but a 3x increase is mind-boggling. So, what was her cause for concern?</span></p><p>She felt anxious that she wasn\u2019t actually learning, because she had delegated almost all the implementation work to AI tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The result was a shallow understanding of her work, which led to both anxiety and guilt.</p><p>Yes, I agreed, this was a cause for concern. You may be able to achieve more in the short term, but overuse of AI will eventually lead to career stagnation. This led to a broader conversation: How can we ensure our career success as we enter an era where AI is increasingly capable?</p><p>An IEEE paper titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/devtime-preprint-TSE19.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Daily Life of Software Developers</a>\u201c found that \u201cdevelopers spend surprisingly little time coding, 9 percent to 61 percent of the workday depending on the study.\u201d In my own experience as a senior engineer at companies like Pinterest and Meta, I probably spent about 40 percent of my time actually writing code. The remaining time was spent collecting information, reading documentation, helping coworkers, or debugging. As AI coding tools become more prominent, more of our time will shift away from simply writing code.</p><p>Therein lies the answer to adapting for the future: become amazing at \u201cfilling in the gaps\u201d for the work that the AI can do. Utilize AI for rote coding tasks, but maintain your critical thinking skills for the significant part of your job that goes beyond writing the code. Here are examples of premium skills going forward: </p><ul><li>Debugging and reviewing AI-generated code</li><li>Monitoring software and working with other teams (humans) to fix issues</li><li>Decomposing a business objective into smaller milestones that we could feed into an AI</li></ul><p>Returning to the Microsoft engineer, I told her that one indication of a healthy AI relationship is to have opinions about the output. You must be able to defend or critique the code generated by the AI tools. If not, you\u2019re at risk of being replaced by AI instead of being amplified by AI. A productivity drop (from a 300 percent efficiency gain back to 50 percent!) is a fine tradeoff to make, as long as you build an ownership mentality.</p><p>The ultimate currency in the workplace, both now and in the future, is trust. Are you trusted to be accountable for your work, or are you simply parroting what the AI is spitting out? Whether you\u2019re a new college grad or a seasoned engineer, you must evolve your role in the knowledge economy to become a productive collaborator with AI.</p><p>\u2014Rahul.</p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trump-international-students\" target=\"_blank\">International Students Are Turning Away From the U.S.</a></h3><p>The United States has long been a magnet for international STEM students.

Over the next year and a half, U.S. President Harry S. Truman resurrected the Office of Civilian Defense (which had been abolished at the end of World War II) and signed into law the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, which mobilized government agencies to plan for the aftermath of a global nuclear war. With the Cold War underway, that act kicked off a decades-long effort to ensure that at least some Americans survived nuclear armageddon. </p><p>As the largest civilian federal agency with a presence throughout the country, the U.S. Post Office Department was in <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/postal-service-role-in-civil-defense.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a unique position</a> to monitor local radiation levels and shelter residents. By the end of 1964, approximately 1,500 postal buildings had been designated as fallout shelters, providing space and emergency supplies for 1.3 million people. Occupants were expected to remain in the shelters until the radioactivity outside was deemed safe. By 1968, about 6,000 postal employees had been trained to use radiological equipment, such as the CD V-700 pictured at top, to monitor beta and gamma radiation. And a group of postal employees organized a volunteer ham radio network to help with communications should the regular networks go down.</p><h2>What was civil defense in the Cold War?</h2><p>The basic premise of civil defense was that many people would die immediately in cities directly targeted by nuclear attacks. (Check out <a href=\"https://alexwellerstein.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Wellerstein</a>\u2019s interactive <a href=\"https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nukemap</a> for an estimate of casualties and impact should your hometown\u2014or any location of your choosing\u2014be hit.) It was the residents of other cities, suburbs, and rural communities outside the blast area that would most benefit from civil defense preparations. With enough warning, they could shelter in a shielded site and wait for the worst of the fallout to decay. Anywhere from a day or two to a few weeks after the attack, they could emerge and aid any survivors in the harder-hit areas.</p><p>In 1957, a committee of the Office of Defense Mobilization drafted the report <a href=\"https://ia803201.us.archive.org/34/items/deteviv00unit/deteviv00unit.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Deterrence and Survival in the Nuclear Age</em></em></a><em><em>, </em></em>for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Better known as the Gaither Report, it called for the creation of a nationwide network of fallout shelters to protect civilians. Government publications such as <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/familyfalloutshe00unitrich/mode/2up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The Family Fallout Shelter</em></em></a><em> </em>encouraged Americans who had the space, the resources, and the will to construct shelters for their homes. City dwellers in apartment buildings warranted only half a page in the booklet, with the suggestion to head to the basement and cooperate with other residents.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a man and a woman sitting in a small room that\\u2019s surrounded by cinder block walls.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b382\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-and-a-woman-sitting-in-a-small-room-that-u2019s-surrounded-by-cinder-block-walls.jpg?id=61330880&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This model fallout shelter from 1960 was designed for four to six people. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Bettmann/Getty Images</small></p><p>Ultimately, very few homeowners actually built a fallout shelter.

Kennedy had started to shift the national strategy from individual shelters to community shelters. At his instruction, the <a href=\"https://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/Historical-Vignettes/Civil-Engineering/035-Preparedness/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers </a>began surveying existing buildings suitable for public shelters. Post offices, especially ones with basements capable of housing at least 50 people, were a natural fit.</p><p>Each postmaster general was designated as the local shelter manager and granted complete authority to operate the shelter, including determining who would be admitted or excluded. The <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/HandbookForFalloutShelterManagement\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Handbook for Fallout Shelter Management</em></em></a> gave guidance for everything from sleeping arrangements to sanitation standards.

Then, within three minutes of finishing the indoor measurements, he would go outside and take a reading at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) from the building. If the radiation level outside was high, there were procedures for decontamination upon returning to the shelter. The \u201cprotection factor\u201d of the shelter was calculated by dividing the outside reading by the inside reading. (Today the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, recommends a PF of at least 40 for a fallout shelter.) Operators were directed to retake the measurements and recalculate the protective factor at least once every 24 hours, or more frequently if the radiation levels changed rapidly. </p><p>The CD V-700 was intended for detecting beta and gamma radiation during cleanup and decontamination operations, and also for detecting any radioactive contamination of food, water, and personnel. </p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pi-pico-gamma-ray-detector\" target=\"_self\">DIY Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy With a Raspberry Pi Pico</a></p><p>Each station would report their dose rates to a regional control center, so that the civil defense organization could determine when people could leave their shelter, where they could go, what routes to take, and what facilities needed decontamination. But if you\u2019ve lived through a natural or manmade disaster, you\u2019ll know that in the immediate aftermath, communications don\u2019t always work so well. Indeed, the <em><em>Handbook for Radiological Monitors </em></em>acknowledged that a nuclear attack might disrupt communications. Luckily, the U.S. Post Office Department had a backup plan.</p><p>In May 1958, <a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/a-postmaster-general-for-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfield</a> made an appeal to all postal employees who happened to be licensed amateur radio operators, to form an informal network that would provide emergency communications in the event of the collapse of telephone and telegraph networks and commercial broadcasting. The result was Post Office Net (PON), a voluntary group of ham radio operators; by 1962, about 1,500 postal employees in 43 states had signed on. That year, PON was opened up to nonemployees who had the necessary license.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ham-radio\" target=\"_self\">The Uncertain Future of Ham Radio</a></p><p>Although PON was never activated due to a nuclear threat, it did transmit messages during other emergencies. For example, in January 1967, after an epic blizzard blanketed Illinois and Michigan with heavy snow, the Michigan PON went into action, setting up liaisons with county weather services and relaying emergency requests, such as rescuing people stranded in vehicles on Interstate 94.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Vintage Civil Defense exhibit with equipment and a sign urging enrollment.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"dc081\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/vintage-civil-defense-exhibit-with-equipment-and-a-sign-urging-enrollment.jpg?id=61331391&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A 1954 civil defense fair featured a display of amateur radios. The U.S. Post Office recruited about 1,500 employees to operate a ham radio network in the event that regular communications went down. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Archives</small></p><p>The post office retired the network on 30 June 1974 as part of its shift away from civil defense preparedness. (<a href=\"https://www.arrl.org/ares\" target=\"_blank\">A volunteer civil emergency-response ham radio network</a> still exists, under the auspices of the American Radio Relay League.) And by 1977, laboratory tests indicated that most of the food and medicine stockpiled in post office basements was no longer fit for human consumption. In 1972 the Office of Civil Defense was replaced by the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency, which was eventually folded into FEMA. And with the end of the Cold War, the civil defense program officially ended in 1994, fortunately without ever being needed for a nuclear attack. </p><h2>Do we still need civil defense?</h2><p>The idea for this column came to me last fall, when I was doing research at the <a href=\"https://www.lindahall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Linda Hall Library</a>, in Kansas City, Mo., and I kept coming across articles about civil defense in magazines and journals from the 1950s and \u201960s. I knew that the Smithsonian\u2019s <a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">National Postal Museum</a>, in Washington, D.C., had several civil defense artifacts (including the CD V-700 and a great \u201c<a href=\"https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:npm_2013.2011.98\" target=\"_blank\">In Time of Emergency</a>\u201d public service announcement record album). </p><p>As a child of the late Cold War, I remember being worried by the prospect of nuclear war. But then the Cold War ended, and so did my fears. I envisioned this month\u2019s column capturing the intriguing history of civil defense and the earnest preparations of the era. That chapter of history, I assumed, was closed.</p><p>Little did I imagine that by the time I began to write this, the prospect of a nuclear attack, if not an all-out war, would suddenly become much more real. These days, I understand the complexities and nuances of nuclear weapons much better than when I was a child. But I\u2019m just as concerned that a nuclear conflict is imminent. Here\u2019s hoping that history repeats itself, and it does not come to that. </p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the August 2025 print issue.</em></em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>The November 1951 issue of <em><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6436902&amp;punumber=6413714\" target=\"_blank\">Electrical Engineering</a> </em>summarized a civil defense conference held at the General Electric Co.\u2019s Electronics Park in Syracuse, N.Y., earlier that year.

For me the moment happened in 2011, when I was a graduate student\u2014not in a lab or a classroom but rather in a conference hall in Rome. I was presenting my graduate research on a helix antenna for wideband terrestrial and GPS L2 communications at the <a href=\"https://www.eucap2026.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European Conference on Antennas and Propagation</a>. EUCAP, organized by the <a href=\"https://www.euraap.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European Association on Antennas and Propagation</a>, is supported by IEEE.</p><p>Although I attended the conference to receive feedback on my research, I left with something far greater: an introduction to IEEE.</p><p>At the time, I didn\u2019t know that the organization would redefine my career, expand my worldview, and plant the seeds of a purpose-driven life in engineering.</p><p>I returned home energized, not only to grow in my field but also within IEEE, so I joined as a graduate student member.</p><p>Fourteen years later, I now serve as chair of the <a href=\"https://ethw.org/IEEE_Islamabad_Section_History\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Islamabad Section</a>, having walked a journey built on learning, leadership, and the belief that engineering must serve humanity.</p><h2>Turning a spark into fuel</h2><p>Upon returning to Pakistan after EUCAP 2011, I realized the immense potential for creating meaningful local impact on the country\u2019s engineers if IEEE\u2019s global energy and resources were effectively harnessed. My background in RF and microwave engineering played a central role in shaping my contributions to IEEE.</p><p>While working at the <a href=\"https://nust.edu.pk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National University of Sciences and Technology</a> (NUST) in Islamabad, I identified a pressing local need that could be addressed using IEEE\u2019s support and resources: The country lacked a centralized platform for microwave and RF-related research, collaboration, and training.</p><p>To fill that gap, in 2016 I formed Pakistan\u2019s first joint chapter of the IEEE <a href=\"https://www.ieeeaps.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Antennas and Propagation</a>, <a href=\"https://ieee-cas.org/welcome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Circuits and Systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.emcs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electromagnetic Compatibility</a>, and <a href=\"https://mtt.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microwave Theory and Techniques</a> societies.</p><p>The joint chapter offers workshops and technical sessions for academics, students, and young professionals. It also provides opportunities for international collaboration and networking among IEEE members.</p><p>More than 200 events have been organized, bringing distinguished professors and researchers to Pakistan as speakers. The visits catalyzed IEEE memorandums of understanding that included student exchange programs and cross-border research.</p><p>More importantly, they exposed hundreds of young Pakistani engineers to world-class knowledge. Faculty and students from all over Pakistan are participating and working at facilities they couldn\u2019t previously access, such as anechoic chambers and electromagnetic compatibility labs that are used in antenna and microwave device testing.</p><p>Our efforts were recognized in 2019 and 2020 with Best Chapter Awards from the societies that formed the joint chapter.</p><p>During the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the chapter launched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@rimms-nust1915\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">webinar series</a> on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> that showed how to use instruments for the characterization of antenna and microwave circuits.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Nosherwan Shoaib, Hammad M.

Pakistan that year experienced the deadliest floods the country had ever seen. An estimated 33 million people were affected, and 20 million are still living in dire conditions. The floods damaged houses, hospitals, and electricity and road infrastructure.</p><p>With support from the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-board-dedicated-humanitarian-activities\" target=\"_self\">IEEE Humanitarian Technology Board</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/special-interest-group-on-humanitarian-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Special Interest Group on Humanitarian Technology</a>, and NUST, IEEE volunteers built 17 homes. They were equipped with solar-powered energy systems that provided electricity for lights, fans, and other basic equipment, ensuring long-term sustainability.</p><p>IEEE volunteers also provided vocational training to survivors, equipping them with practical skills in basic electronics and solar installation. Their efforts aimed to restore livelihoods, promote self-reliance, and empower people to launch home-based businesses.</p><p>In 2023 I worked with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-15th-anniversary\" target=\"_self\">EPICS in IEEE</a> to develop a <a href=\"https://epics.ieee.org/project/development-of-behavioral-therapy-metaverse-for-autistic-children-pakistan/\" target=\"_blank\">virtual reality\u2013based therapy platform</a> aimed at supporting behavioral development in children with autism. A team of undergraduate students developed the platform, which uses a VR headset to simulate behavioral and communication therapy scenarios within the metaverse. The platform is still being tested and validated.</p><p>Another EPICS in IEEE initiative I led involved designing and deploying a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMwmIrzmcrE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart fall-detection system</a> for elderly people in assisted-living facilities. The system uses 60-gigahertz radar sensors to monitor posture and alert caregivers in the event of a fall.</p><h2>Diversity and inclusion in engineering</h2><p>Promoting diversity and inclusion has been a vital part of my IEEE journey. Thanks to support from the <a href=\"https://ieee-cas.org/society-involvement/women-cas-wicas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Women in Circuits and Systems</a> group and the <a href=\"https://lamc-ieee.org/students/diversity-inclusion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE MTT-S diversity and inclusion ad hoc committee</a>, I have organized initiatives aimed at inspiring women and other underrepresented groups to pursue engineering as a career.</p><p>I was chosen as a <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/get-involved/ieee-members/stem-champions/#:~:text=The%20STEM%20Champion%20Program%20empowers,inspiring%20others%20to%20get%20involved.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STEM champion</a> this year in the <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/get-involved/ieee-members/stem-champions/#:~:text=The%20STEM%20Champion%20Program%20empowers,inspiring%20others%20to%20get%20involved.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE TryEngineering program</a>. Champions work to do more STEM outreach and connect future engineers with IEEE resources.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">IEEE has been more than a professional network; it has been my launchpad for leadership, my platform for humanitarian impact, and my community of mentors.</p><p>I promote STEM education by engaging with preuniversity schools and organizing hands-on activities to spark curiosity and learning. Being a champion has been an enriching experience.</p><p>My belief in equitable access to education has been the cornerstone of my STEM outreach efforts. I have led more than 30 workshops in collaboration with 20 local nonprofits, benefiting more than 500 orphans and homeless children. The hands-on sessions covered radar, robotics, wireless communication, and other topics. Together with a team of IEEE student volunteers, we also trained teachers to replicate the activities in schools.</p><p>Through my work, I have had the opportunity to instill core ethical values in students living in underserved communities. This role has allowed me to advocate for both technical excellence and moral responsibility\u2014two pillars I believe are essential for building a better future through engineering.</p><h2>Collaboration is key</h2><p>A major turning point in my volunteer journey came in 2022 through the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities</a> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-volt-marks-10-years\" target=\"_self\">Volunteer Leadership Training program</a>. The VoLT program is designed to deepen volunteers\u2019 understanding of IEEE\u2019s structure, products, services, and available resources. It also helps participants appreciate their role within local units and the broader organization while preparing them for leadership roles. VoLT participants complete a team project, in which they identify a problem, a need, an opportunity, or an area of improvement within their local organizational unit or the global IEEE. Then they develop a business plan to address the concern.</p><p>For me, the program provided clarity, confidence, and community. My team project\u2014an AI-based vestibule for IEEE\u2014was ranked second among the submissions. The program was more than just a training exercise; it was a catalyst for my growth as a structured, strategic, and succession-focused leader.</p><p>One of my most recent leadership opportunities was chairing the Towards IEEE Pakistan Council mini-conference in May. The event brought together executive committee members from IEEE sections and subsections across Pakistan to explore the formation of a national IEEE council to unify efforts with global IEEE practices.</p><p>I also spearheaded the establishment of the IEEE Islamabad Section <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-life-members-reconnect\" target=\"_self\">life member affinity group</a> and the IEEE Communications Society professional chapter.</p><p>I believe the active involvement of senior members is essential\u2014not only for their mentorship and wisdom but also to help the section reach new heights of excellence.</p><p>I strongly believe in cross-institutional collaboration\u2014which is why the IEEE Islamabad Section is actively partnering with organizations including the <a href=\"https://pakaero.com.pk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pakistan Aerospace Council</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theiet.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.imeche.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Institution of Mechanical Engineers</a> to amplify our impact on the engineering and scientific community. The partnerships will enable joint technical seminars and training workshops that broaden our outreach and strengthen our contributions.</p><p>Through international conferences, seminars, joint workshops, and collaborative projects, the IEEE Islamabad Section has engaged with leading electronics companies <a href=\"https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/home_48230.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rohde and Schwarz</a> of Munich and <a href=\"https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Keysight Technologies</a> of Everett, Wash., to promote innovation, skills development, and applied research. The collaborations enhance students\u2019 professional readiness and enable industry partners to connect with emerging academic talent and cutting-edge ideas.</p><h2>A leadership launchpad</h2><p>What started as a student membership has grown into a purpose-filled career-long journey. IEEE has been more than a professional network; it has been my launchpad for leadership, my platform for humanitarian impact, and my community of mentors. Every conference I organized, every child I taught, every family I supported, and every volunteer I mentored are chapters of my story, which IEEE helped write.</p><p>To all young engineers, students, and professionals reading this: IEEE is what you make of it. It can be merely a line on your CV, or it can be a compass that guides your career and character. When you align technical skill with empathy and pair leadership with service, you not only grow, you uplift others as well.</p><p>I invite you to <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/join\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">join, volunteer, and lead</a>. Somewhere, someone is waiting for a solution only you can create\u2014and IEEE can help you deliver it.</p><p>My journey has never been mine alone. It has been a collective effort powered by an extraordinary community. I look forward to continuing the mission together, as we strive to make IEEE not just a professional home but also a platform for lasting impact.</p>"

Farmers like Joe are helping to move his country of 237 million people toward self-sufficiency in rice.</p><p>But farmer Joe has a handicap. \u201cFor me, the power grid is a fiction,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t get any electricity from the grid, and I never will.\u201d</p><p>Five years ago, Joe installed solar panels to power his farm\u2019s irrigation system, which draws water from a nearby river. His milling and bagging machines, meanwhile, still run on diesel generators.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 600 million people\u2014about 53 percent\u2014still have <a href=\"https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditccom2023d1_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">no access to electricity</a>. Even this grim statistic understates the problem, because \u201caccess\u201d can mean just enough wattage to illuminate a few LED lightbulbs some of the time. It\u2019s not what Western Europeans or North Americans would consider electricity.</p><p>And <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nigeria-power-grid\" target=\"_self\">traditional power grids in sub-Saharan Africa</a> are hampered by poor reliability and frequent outages. Even when offered electricity, many customers can\u2019t afford to pay, and so theft of service is endemic.

Such a rapid expansion means bringing electricity to an additional 4.2 million people <em><em>every month</em></em> on average.</p><p>While plausible, the expansion faces headwinds, most notably from the sub-Saharan\u2019s net population gain of about 2.5 million people per month. If that population growth continues for all six years of the initiative, there will be an additional 180 million people requiring electricity access.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is large.

Natural gas is the single largest source of electricity generation, while coal is significant only in South Africa. Together, they account for roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s electricity production, according to BloombergNEF.

UNCTAD estimates that Africa has 60 percent of the world\u2019s best global solar resources. That translates to a solar potential of over 10 terawatts. \u201cOff-grid solar and storage is taking off in a big way,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonia-dunlop-62868354\" target=\"_blank\">Sonia Dunlop</a>, CEO of the <a href=\"https://www.globalsolarcouncil.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Solar Council</a> in London. \u201cThere are already about 600 million people, almost all in sub-Saharan Africa, who use off-grid solar and storage at least once a week.\u201d Dunlop expects to see a 40 percent increase in solar installations next year in the region.</p><p>Off-grid solar power lends itself to bottom-up bootstrapping in rural areas by communities, small farms, businesses, and residential customers. To make the technology more affordable, the expansion of microfinancing will be key, as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tIEmpwEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Mwoya Byaro</a> and<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nanzia_Mmbaga\" target=\"_blank\"> Nanzia Florent Mmbaga</a> point out in a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227622003209\" target=\"_blank\">2022 study</a> in <em><em>Scientific African</em></em>.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED:<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/offgrid-solars-killer-app\" target=\"_self\"> Off-Grid Solar\u2019s Killer App</a></p><p>I know firsthand the difference off-grid solar can make.

They now illuminate communal areas that were formerly dark at night. The compound and the neighborhood aren\u2019t connected to the grid, though, so for indoor electricity, our relatives still rely on diesel generators.</p><h2>The future of hydropower in sub-Saharan Africa</h2><p>While off-grid solar could bring electricity to millions of people, hydropower is \u201cAfrica\u2019s renewable-electricity powerhouse, largely thanks to excellent resources in the East and Central regions of the continent,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/Africa-Power-Transition-Factbook-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">BloombergNEF reported in 2024</a>.

As with solar, Africa uses only a small fraction of its hydropower potential. Mini hydropower dams from 100 kilowatts to 1 megawatt are important for remote and small communities of around 50 to 500 homes, MacColl says. Large dams are under construction or have been recently completed in Angola, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Zambia.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24668849/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p><span>But constructing hydropower dams is costly and carries the risk of corruption and mismanagement that comes with big projects, as well as the cost of connecting a new power source to the power grid.

But Ghana, which runs a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Research_Reactor-1\" target=\"_blank\">research reactor</a>, is planning its first nuclear power plant with assistance from China, Japan, and the United States. Uganda has chosen a site for its first reactors, as has Kenya. And the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority says it has signed technical agreements on nuclear power with France, India, Russia, and South Korea. But in all these cases, generating electricity from nuclear power is at least a decade away, according to the World Nuclear Association.</p><h2>Kenya\u2019s electrification success story</h2><p> Ultimately, increased access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa will come from a variety of sources. One success story is Kenya, where off-grid electricity, primarily from solar, is complementing expanded grid access. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://idev.afdb.org/sites/default/files/documents/files/IE%20of%20the%20AfDB-supported%20Kenya%20Last%20Mile%20Connectivity%20Project%20Phase%20I%20-%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Last Mile Connectivity Project</a> aims to extend the grid to an additional 280,000 residences, 30,000 businesses, and health centers and schools in all 47 counties, according to the African Development Bank, which helped fund the effort. Previously, the national utility, Kenya Power, succeeded in increasing the number of grid-connected households in the <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/478251467995396760/pdf/106032-BRI-PUBLIC-IMPACT-9-ESMAP-ImpactStory-Kenya-Electrification.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">poorest urban areas</a> from 3,000 to 150,000. Kenya also has the largest wind farm in Africa, the <a href=\"https://ltwp.co.ke/\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Turkana Wind Power Project</a>. The 310-MW plant\u2019s 365 turbines account for about 15 percent of Kenya\u2019s installed electricity capacity.</p><p>These sustained efforts <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinero/2025/05/09/kenya-more-than-doubled-electricity-access-over-a-decade\" target=\"_blank\">doubled Kenya\u2019s electrification access rate</a> between 2013 and 2023 to 79 percent. Kenya Power now aims to achieve <a href=\"https://newsroom.kplc.co.ke/articles/a-total-of-150000-customers-targeted-for-connection-in-a-new-last-mile-connectivity-project\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">universal electricity access by 2030</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Nigeria, the most populous sub-Saharan country, the outlook for electricity access is cloudier. Joe, the Nigerian rice farmer, is considering installing more solar on his farm, to expand his mill. With more electricity, he says, \u201cwe can grow more rice, and mill and bag more for our people.\u201d If the power grid won\u2019t\u2014or can\u2019t\u2014come to him, at least he has the means to generate his own electricity to meet his own needs. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

While we continue to debate whether artificial intelligence (AI) <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/sentient-ai\" target=\"_blank\">can possess consciousness</a>, one thing is certain: AI will experience time differently. Its sense of time will be dictated not by biology, but by its computational, sensory, and communication processes. How will we coexist with an alien intelligence that perceives and acts in a very different temporal world?</p><h2>What Simultaneity Means to a Human</h2><p>Clap your hands while looking at them. You see, hear, and feel the clap as a single multimodal event\u2014the visual, audio, and tactile senses appear simultaneous and define the \u201cnow.\u201d Our consciousness plays out these sensory inputs as simultaneous, although they arrive at different times: Light reaches our eyes faster than sound reaches our ears, while our brain processes audio faster than it does complex visual information. Still, it all feels like one moment.</p><p>That illusion stems from a built-in brain mechanism. The brain defines \u201cnow\u201d through a brief window of time during which multiple sensory perceptions are collected and integrated. This span of time, usually<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2015-07857-001.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> up to few hundreds of milliseconds</a>, is called the temporal window of integration (TWI). As a proxy for this temporal grid, films with 24 frames per second create an illusion of continuous movement.</p><p>But the human TWI has its limits. See a distant lightning flash and you\u2019ll hear the rumble of thunder seconds later. The human TWI evolved to stitch together sensory information only for events within roughly 10 to 15 meters. That\u2019s our horizon of simultaneity.</p><h2>Alien Intelligence in the Physical World</h2><p>AI is poised to become a standard part of robots and other machines that perceive and interact with the physical world. These machines will use sensors hardwired to their bodies, but also remote sensors that send digital data from afar. A robot may receive data from a satellite orbiting 600 km above Earth and treat the data as real-time, as transmission takes only 2 ms\u2014far faster than the human TWI.</p><p>A human\u2019s sensors are \u201chardwired\u201d to the body, which establishes two premises for how the brain interacts with the physical world. First, the propagation delay from each sensor to the brain is predictable. When a sound occurs in the environment, the unpredictable factor is the distance between the sound source and our ears; the time delay from the ears to the brain is fixed. Second, each sensor is used by only one human brain. The human horizon of simultaneity evolved through millions of years under these premises, optimized to help us assess opportunities and threats. A lion at 15 meters was worth worrying about, but thunder at 3 kilometers was likely not.</p><p>These two premises won\u2019t always be valid for intelligent machines with multimodal perception. An AI system may receive data from a remote sensor with unpredictable link delays. And a single sensor can provide data to many different AI modules in real time, like an eye shared by multiple brains. As a result, AI systems will evolve their own perception of space and time and their own horizon of simultaneity, and they\u2019ll change much faster than the glacial pace of human evolution. We will soon coexist with an alien intelligence that has a different perception of time and space.</p><h2>The AI Time Advantage</h2><p>Here\u2019s where things get strange. AI systems are not limited by biological processing speeds and can perceive time with unprecedented precision, discovering cause-and-effect relationships that occur too quickly for human perception.</p><p>In our hyperconnected world, this could lead to wide-scale<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Rashomon effects</a>, where multiple observers give conflicting perspectives on events. (The term comes from a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> classic Japanese film</a> in which several characters describe the same incident in dramatically different ways, each shaped by their own perspective.) </p><p>Imagine a traffic accident in the year 2045 at a busy city intersection, witnessed by three observers: a human pedestrian, an AI system directly connected to street sensors, and a remote AI system receiving the same sensory data over a digital link. The human simply perceives a robot entering the road just before a car crashes into it. The local AI, with immediate sensor access, records the precise order: the robot moving first, then the car braking, then the collision. Meanwhile, the remote AI\u2019s perception is skewed by communication delays, perhaps logging the braking before it perceives the robot stepping into the road. Each perspective offers a different sequence of cause and effect. Which witness will be considered credible, a human or a machine? And which machine? </p><p>People with malicious intent could even use high-powered AI systems to fabricate \u201cevents\u201d using generative AI, and could insert them in the overall flow of events perceived by less capable machines. Humans equipped with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/augmented-reality\" target=\"_blank\">extended-reality interfaces</a> might be especially vulnerable to such manipulations, as they\u2019d be continuously taking in digital sensory data.</p><p>If the sequence of events is distorted, it can disrupt our sense of causality, potentially disrupting time-critical systems such as emergency response, financial trading, or autonomous driving. People could even use AI systems capable of predicting events milliseconds before they occur to confuse and confound. If an AI system predicted an event and transmitted false data at precisely the right moment, it could create a false appearance of causality. For example, an AI that could predict movements of the stock market could publish a fabricated news alert just before an anticipated sell-off.</p><h2>Computers Put Timestamps, Nature Does Not</h2><p>The engineer\u2019s instinct might be to solve the problem with digital timestamps on sensory data. However, timestamps require precise clock synchronization, which requires more power than many small devices can handle.</p><p>And even if sensory data is timestamped, communication or processing delays may cause it to arrive too late for an intelligent machine to act on the data in real time. Imagine an industrial robot in a factory tasked with stopping a machine if a worker gets too close. Sensors detect a worker\u2019s movement and a warning signal\u2014including a timestamp\u2014travels over the network. But there\u2019s an unexpected network hiccup and the signal arrives after 200 milliseconds, so the robot acts too late to prevent an accident. The timestamps don\u2019t make communication delays predictable, but they can help to reconstruct what went wrong after the fact.</p><p>Nature, of course, does not put timestamps on events. We infer temporal flow and causality by comparing the arrival times of event data and integrating it with the brain\u2019s model of the world.</p><p>Albert Einstein\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/einstein-states-his-theory-special-relativity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> special theory of relativity</a> noted that simultaneity depends on the observer\u2019s frame of reference and can vary with motion. However, it also showed that the causal order of events, the sequence in which causes lead to effects, remains consistent for all observers. Not so for intelligent machines. Because of unpredictable communication delays and variable processing times, intelligent machines may perceive events in a different causal order altogether.</p><p>In 1978,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Leslie Lamport</a> addressed this issue for distributed computing, introducing logical clocks to determine \u201chappened before\u201d relation among digital events. To adapt this approach to the intersection of the physical and digital worlds, we must grapple with unpredictable delays between a real-world event and its digital timestamp.</p><p>This crucial tunneling from the physical to the digital world happens at specific access points: a digital device or sensor, WiFi routers, satellites, and base stations. As individual devices or sensors can be hacked fairly easily, the responsibility for maintaining accurate and trustworthy information about time and causal order will fall increasingly on large digital infrastructure nodes.</p><p>This vision aligns with developments within 6G, the forthcoming wireless standard. In 6G, base stations will not only relay information, they will also sense their environments. These future base stations must become trustworthy gateways between the physical and the digital worlds. Developing such technologies could prove essential as we enter an unpredictable future shaped by rapidly evolving alien intelligences.</p>"

Their task: to attach the orb to the line where it will track real-time environmental conditions affecting the capacity of the wire.</p><p>To hoist the orb onto the overhead line, a crew member attaches it to a quadcopter drone and pilots it up with a remote control. As it nears the wire, one side of the orb slides open, like a real-life Pac-Man about to chomp a power pellet, and then clamps down. The process takes about 10 seconds and requires no electrical downtime.</p><p>Oslo-based <a href=\"https://www.heimdallpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Heimdall Power</a>, the manufacturer of the orb, has installed over 200 of them on the transmission lines of <a href=\"https://www.sh-netz.com/de.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SH-Netz</a>, the grid operator in the northernmost part of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/germany\" target=\"_blank\">Germany</a>. Together, the devices form a system that calculates how much current these high-voltage lines can safely carry based on real-time weather conditions. The hotter it is, the lower their capacity.</p><p>Historically, grid operators have estimated the capacity of lines based on average seasonal temperatures\u2014a fixed value called static line rating. For safety, the estimates must be highly conservative and assume that the weather is always very warm for the respective season. So for all but the hottest days, transmission lines <em>could</em> carry significantly more electricity, if grid operators only knew the actual temperature of the wires.</p><p>Tools like Heimdall\u2019s orb, dubbed the Neuron, can fill in that blank. By tracking information such as the sag of the line and ambient temperature, the system can more accurately determine the temperature\u2014and therefore the real-time capacity\u2014of the line. This allows grid operators to take advantage of the unused headroom by maximizing the current in that line. The system uses weather forecasts to predict the temperature and capacity of the lines for the next day, which is especially useful for day-ahead planning.</p><h2>Dynamic Line Rating Offers Grid-Congestion Solution</h2><p>The strategy, called <a href=\"https://inl.gov/national-security/dynamic-line-rating/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic line rating</a>, or DLR, is being rapidly adopted in North America and Europe as an antidote\u2014at least in the short term\u2014to grid congestion woes. New transmission lines are needed to accommodate the explosion of AI data centers, electrification, and renewable energy generation, but building them is a notoriously lengthy task often requiring a decade or more. In the interim, grid operators must do more with existing infrastructure.</p><p>Dynamic line rating and other grid-enhancing technologies, or GETs, offer a quick and inexpensive fix\u2014a bridge until new transmission can be built. Heimdall is one of many companies, including <a href=\"https://www.linevisioninc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Linevision</a> in Boston and <a href=\"https://www.gridraven.com/company\" target=\"_blank\">Gridraven</a> in Tallinn, Estonia, providing the technology.</p><p>\u201cTransmission operators aren\u2019t maximizing the potential of our power lines, leading to unnecessarily high energy costs for consumers,\u201d said <a href=\"https://advancedenergyunited.org/about/team/caitlin-marquis\" target=\"_blank\">Caitlin Marquis</a>, managing director at <a href=\"https://advancedenergyunited.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Energy United</a>, an industry advocacy group, <a href=\"https://blog.advancedenergyunited.org/articles/ferc-dlr-anopr-2024\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement</a>. \u201cDynamic line ratings are one of the most cost-effective tools we have for getting more out of our existing power-grid infrastructure.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Heimdall Power's metallic orb technology, called Neuron, installed on a power line above a coastal scene.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c3c79\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/heimdall-power-s-metallic-orb-technology-called-neuron-installed-on-a-power-line-above-a-coastal-scene.jpg?id=61449817&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Heimdall Power\u2019s orb tracks line sag, ambient temperature, sunlight intensity, and other metrics on a transmission line in southwestern Norway.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Heimdall Power</small></p><h2>Heimdall\u2019s Grid-Enhancing Technologies</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://www.heimdallpower.com/technology\" target=\"_blank\">Heimdall\u2019s approach</a>, one of the key metrics its sensors track is line sag; as metal wires get hotter, they expand and make the line droop. Measuring sag helps determine how much capacity drops. The sensors also track other information such as ambient temperature and sunlight intensity. Heimdall combines the information with local weather-forecast data\u2014particularly wind speed, which has a cooling effect on power lines and can thus increase their capacity.</p><p>Heimdall\u2019s machine learning uses the data to help grid operators plan how they\u2019ll route electricity for the next day. In urgent situations, they can use real-time data from its sensors to adapt on the fly.</p><p>After working mostly with utilities in Europe, last year the company opened a headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to better access the U.S. market. Its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-line-sensors-smart-grid\" target=\"_blank\">first major U.S. project</a>, in Minnesota, is helping the utility <a href=\"https://greatriverenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Great River Energy</a> <a href=\"https://greatriverenergy.com/transmission/new-tech-holds-potential-to-unlock-hidden-grid-capacity/\" target=\"_blank\">increase its capacity by 25 percent</a> nearly 70 percent of the time, according to the utility. Heimdall has deals with six additional U.S. utilities bringing its technology to 13 states.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last 80-plus years building the North American power grid, and we\u2019re basically still running it the way we did in the beginning,\u201d says Heimdall U.S. President <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/britaformato/\" target=\"_blank\">Brita Formato</a>. \u201cDLR lets us bring the existing grid into the digital age\u2014essentially overnight, and with relatively low cost and effort.\u201d</p><h2>Linevision\u2019s Lidar Sensors Enhance Power-Line Monitoring</h2><p>Linevision, another dynamic line rating provider, uses lidar sensors to monitor line sag, and combines the data with weather forecasting and computer analysis of how wind is affected by objects near power lines. Instead of putting its sensors directly on the power lines, the company mounts them on the towers. This makes installation and operation easier, according to Linevision.</p><p>The company originally used electromagnetic sensors to indirectly measure loading on each line but pivoted to lidar as it became cheaper and more widely deployed in self-driving cars. \u201cWhen we made that switch, we were riding the wave of autonomous vehicles,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linevisioninc.com/our-team/jonathan-marmillo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Marmillo</a>, Linevision\u2019s cofounder and chief business officer.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Linevision's LUX sensor installed on the body of a power line tower.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c3b14\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/linevision-s-lux-sensor-installed-on-the-body-of-a-power-line-tower.jpg?id=61449880&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Linevision\u2019s LUX sensor uses lidar to monitor line sag and is installed on transmission line towers.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Linevision</small></p><p>For the wind prediction, Linevision starts with a detailed, publicly available spatial map that includes buildings and trees, then uses machine learning to interpret how obstructions change wind near power lines. Marmillo says it takes about 90 days of learning for the system to create accurate predictions of line capacities after it\u2019s installed. Utilities then integrate that into their grid-management software.</p><p>After completing an earlier project with Linevision, National Grid, the grid operator for England and Wales, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgrid.com/media-centre/press-releases/national-grid-installs-grid-enhancing-technology\" target=\"_blank\">in June announced a new, bigger project</a> with the company, on 263 kilometers of 400-kV lines. The first project increased capacity by 31 percent on average, freeing lines to carry an additional gigawatt of power and saving customers \u00a314 million annually (US $19 million). The new project is expected to save customers \u00a320 million annually ($27 million).</p><h2>Gridraven\u2019s Wind Forecasting Boosts Dynamic Line Rating</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/estonia\" target=\"_blank\">Estonia</a>, DLR provider Gridraven takes a different tack: It doesn\u2019t use hardware at all. Instead, it relies on machine learning to make accurate, hyperlocal wind predictions. The predictions are based on weather forecasts and a detailed terrain map made from satellite and lidar scans.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgrute/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Georg Rute</span></a>, the CEO and cofounder, was working for Estonia\u2019s national grid operator in 2018 when he noticed that forecasts of wind around power lines were \u201creally bad,\u201d he says. Rute came back to study the question in 2023 with Gridraven\u2019s other two cofounders, finding that two-thirds of the error in wind prediction was caused by the landscape\u2014mainly buildings and trees.<span></span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Portrait of Gridraven's CEO, Georg Rute.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"af5d7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-gridraven-s-ceo-georg-rute.jpg?id=61449920&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Gridraven\u2019s CEO, Georg Rute, founded the company after realizing that hyperlocal wind forecasting wasn\u2019t accurate enough for dynamic line rating.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Gridraven</small></p><p>Gridraven began its first large rollout last month, covering <a href=\"https://www.gridraven.com/news/gridraven-secures-fingrid-tender-for-software-based-dlr-solution\" target=\"_blank\">700 km of Finland\u2019s 400-kV lines</a>, and plans to expand to the country\u2019s entire 5,500-km network of high-voltage transmission lines. \u201cWith DLR, it is particularly possible to support the integration of wind power into the grid,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arto-pahkin-167526b\" target=\"_blank\">Arto Pahkin</a>, a manager at <a href=\"https://www.fingrid.fi/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Fingrid</a>, Finland\u2019s transmission system operator. \u201cThis makes DLR a strategically important part of the integration of renewable energy.\u201d Gridraven\u2019s system can increase capacity of power lines by 30 percent on average, according to the company.</p><p>DLR companies are quick to point out that the technology is not a cure for all that ails our grids; over the long term, we will simply need more transmission. Congestion is already raising electricity prices and increasing outages. Since 2021, <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies_2023-Transmission-Congestion-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">grid congestion has cost American consumers $12\u2013$21 billion per year</a>, depending on electricity prices and weather.</p><p>Other grid-enhancing technologies can help in the meantime. For example, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/grid-enhancing-technologies\" target=\"_self\">reconductoring</a> existing lines with advanced materials can double their capacity. But that approach also takes the lines out of use while the new materials are installed, and it\u2019s more expensive than DLR.</p><p>\u201cThe potential of DLR is to unlock up to one-third more capacity in the existing grid globally,\u201d said Rute. \u201cThis would boost economic growth and increase affordability right away while more grid is being built.\u201d</p>"
