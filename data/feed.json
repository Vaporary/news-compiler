We use the class of constant elasticity trade models to provide quantitative evidence on these questions. We find that reductions in worldwide trade frictions over the period from 1960-2020 reduced the share of the United States in global GDP but raised its aggregate welfare. Similarly, productivity growth in Japan and China led to a decline in the relative income of the United States, but brought aggregate welfare gains from the resulting expansion in global production possibilities. Trade integration and foreign productivity growth have relatively modest effects on domestic income and welfare compared to domestic productivity growth."

        "summary": "This paper provides direct evidence that members of a disfavored group adjust their economic behavior in response to prejudice. We exploit plausibly exogenous, localized increases in anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment generated by combat fatalities of U.S. service members from a given state during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. Linking detailed records on military fatalities with survey data, we estimate the causal effect of these shocks on the labor supply of Arab and Muslim men residing in the affected states. Following a home-state fatality, Arab and Muslim men reduce their weekly hours of work by approximately one percent relative to the baseline sample mean. The reduction is twice as large among the self-employed and concentrated in occupations requiring frequent customer or co-worker interaction. These patterns are consistent with avoidance-based sorting predicted by prejudice-based models of discrimination. The timing of the response coincides with short-lived increases in anti-Muslim hate crimes, confirming that the estimated effects reflect shifts in prejudice rather than broader economic conditions. Our findings provide direct evidence that prejudice can distort market outcomes by inducing targeted individuals to withdraw from interactions with prejudiced market participants."

Our experiment was embedded in a Bank of Italy survey covering around 3,000 firms. We elicited firms\u2019 beliefs about competitors\u2019 adoption of two advanced technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics. We randomly provided half of the sample with accurate information about adoption rates. Most firms substantially underestimated competitors\u2019 current adoption, and when provided with information, they updated their expectations about competitors\u2019 future adoption. The information increased firms\u2019 own intended future adoption of robotics, although we do not observe a significant effect on AI adoption. Our findings provide causal evidence on coordination in innovation and illustrate how information frictions shape technology diffusion."

Leveraging new audit questions in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS), and complementary tax return data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and detailed financial records from Sageworks, we find that (i) variation in reporting quality explains 10--20 percent of intra-industry total factor productivity dispersion, and (ii) evidence of complementarity between the effects of financial audits and management practices driving firm productivity. We then examine the underlying mechanisms. First, audits function as a managerial technology, improving the precision of internal information and raising efficiency, with stronger effects in competitive, low-margin industries and among younger firms. Second, exploiting cross-state variation in tax incentives, we show that audits constrain underreporting and mitigate the downward bias in measured productivity. Together, these results highlight the underrated importance of financial reporting quality driving firm productivity."

In contrast, informed sellers are less sensitive to news but appear to wait for the offer that they deem acceptable."

        "summary": "How does a task-level minimum pay requirement for gig workers affect their earnings and employment? We study this question in the context of a January 2024 law in Seattle that establishes a per-task minimum pay standard for app-based delivery workers. Drawing on novel cross-platform, trip-level gig activity data, we compare earnings and employment trajectories around the implementation of the law for workers who were doing delivery work in Seattle before the reform against workers who had been active in other regions of Washington State. We find that the minimum pay law raised delivery pay per task, though the increases in base pay per task were partially offset by a substantial reduction in average tips, a major component of delivery pay. At the same time, the policy led to a reduction in the number of tasks completed by highly attached incumbent drivers (but not an increase in exit from delivery work), completely offsetting increased pay per task and leading to zero effect on monthly earnings. We find evidence that drivers experienced more unpaid idle time and longer distances driven between tasks, but find no evidence that drivers reduced their total time working on delivery apps and only limited evidence of switching from delivery to ride-hailing work. Using a simple model of the labor market for platform delivery drivers, we show that our evidence is consistent with free entry of drivers into the delivery market driving down the task-finding rate until expected earnings return to their pre-reform level. These findings highlight the challenges of raising pay in spot markets for tasks where there is free entry of workers."

In general, a VPP pulls together many small components\u2014like rooftop solar, home batteries, and smart thermostats\u2014into a single coordinated power system. The system responds to grid needs on demand, whether by making stored energy available or reducing energy consumption by smart devices during peak hours.</p><p>VPPs <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-real-power\" target=\"_self\">had a moment</a> in the mid-2010s, but market conditions and the technology weren\u2019t quite aligned for them to take off. Electricity demand <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65264\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wasn\u2019t high enough</a>, and existing sources\u2014coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables\u2014met demand and kept prices stable. Additionally, despite the costs of hardware like solar panels and batteries falling, the software to link and manage these resources lagged behind, and there wasn\u2019t much financial incentive for it to catch up. </p><p>But times have changed, and less than a decade later, the stars are aligning in VPPs\u2019 favor. They\u2019re hitting a deployment inflection point, and they could play a significant role in meeting energy demand over the next 5 to 10 years in a way that\u2019s faster, cheaper, and greener than other solutions. </p><h2>U.S. Electricity Demand Is Growing</h2><p>Electricity demand in the United States is expected to <a href=\"https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/electricity-demand-expected-to-grow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">grow 25 percent</a> by 2030 due to data center buildouts, electric vehicles, manufacturing, and electrification, according to estimates from technology consultant ICF International.</p><p>At the same time, a host of bottlenecks are making it hard to expand the grid. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-data-centers\" target=\"_self\">backlog of at least</a> three to five years on new gas turbines.

This all adds up to a long, slow process to add generation and delivery capacity, and it\u2019s not getting faster anytime soon.</p><p> \u201cFueling electric vehicles, electric heat, and data centers solely from traditional approaches would increase rates that are already too high,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-heavner-9a63b311/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Heavner</a>, the executive director of the <a href=\"https://calssa.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Solar & Storage Association</a>. </p><p>Enter the vast network of resources that are already active and grid-connected\u2014and the perfect storm of factors that make now the time to scale them. <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/nasiri_adel.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adel Nasiri</a>, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of South Carolina, says variability of loads from data centers and electric vehicles has increased, as has deployment of grid-scale batteries and storage. There are more distributed energy resources available than there were before, and the last decade has seen advances in grid management using autonomous controls.</p><p>At the heart of it all, though, is the technology that stores and dispatches electricity on demand: batteries. </p><h2>Advances in Battery Technology</h2><p>Over the last 10 years, battery prices have plummeted: the average <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lithium-ion battery pack</a><a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> price</a> fell from US $715 per kilowatt-hour in 2014 to $115 per kWh in 2024. Their <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">energy density</a> has simultaneously increased thanks to a combination of materials advancements, design optimization of battery cells, and improvements in the packaging of battery systems, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-gross-b4a86714/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oliver Gross</a>, a senior fellow in energy storage and electrification at automaker Stellantis.</p><p>The biggest improvements have come in batteries\u2019 cathodes and electrolytes, with nickel-based cathodes starting to be used about a decade ago. \u201cIn many ways, the cathode limits the capacity of the battery, so by unlocking higher capacity cathode materials, we have been able to take advantage of the intrinsic higher capacity of anode materials,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregless/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Less</a>, the director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Battery Lab.</p><p>Increasing the percentage of nickel in the cathode (relative to other metals) increases energy density because nickel can hold more lithium per gram than materials like cobalt or manganese, exchanging more electrons and participating more fully in the redox reactions that move lithium in and out of the battery. The same goes for silicon, which has become more common in anodes. However, there\u2019s a trade-off: These materials cause more structural instability during the battery\u2019s cycling.</p><p>The anode and cathode are surrounded by a liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte has to be electrically and chemically stable when exposed to the anode and cathode in order to avoid safety hazards like thermal runaway or fires and rapid degradation. \u201cThe real revolution has been the breakthroughs in chemistry to make the electrolyte stable against more reactive cathode materials to get the energy density up,\u201d says Gross. Chemical compound additives\u2014many of them based on sulfur and boron chemistry\u2014for the electrolyte help create stable layers between it and the anode and cathode materials. \u201cThey form these protective layers very early in the manufacturing process so that the cell stays stable throughout its life.\u201d</p><p>These advances have primarily been made on electric vehicle batteries, which differ from grid-scale batteries in that EVs are often parked or idle, while grid batteries are constantly connected and need to be ready to transfer energy. However, Gross says, \u201cthe same approaches that got our energy density higher in EVs can also be applied to optimizing grid storage. The materials might be a little different, but the methodologies are the same.\u201d The most popular cathode material for grid storage batteries at the moment is lithium iron phosphate, or LFP.</p><p>Thanks to these technical gains and dropping costs, a domino effect has been set in motion: The more batteries deployed, the cheaper they become, which fuels more deployment and creates positive feedback loops.</p><p>Regions that have experienced frequent blackouts\u2014like parts of <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/07/18/texas-energy-grid-power-outages-climate-change-infrastructure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Texas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-11-06/edison-blacks-out-more-customers-to-stop-utility-sparked-fires\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/puerto-rico-earthquake-power-outages-prepa-news\" target=\"_self\">Puerto Rico</a>\u2014are a prime market for home batteries. Texas-based <a href=\"https://www.basepowercompany.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Base Power</a>, which raised $1 billion in Series C funding in October, installs batteries at customers\u2019 homes and becomes their retail power provider, charging the batteries when excess wind or solar production makes prices cheap, and then selling that energy back to the grid when demand spikes.</p><p>There is, however, still room for improvement. For wider adoption, says Nasiri, \u201cthe installed battery cost needs to get under $100 per kWh for large VPP deployments.\u201d</p><h2>Improvements in VPP Software</h2><p>The software infrastructure that once limited VPPs to pilot projects has matured into a robust digital backbone, making it feasible to operate VPPs at grid scale. Advances in AI are key: Many VPPs now use machine learning algorithms to predict load flexibility, solar and battery output, customer behavior, and grid stress events. This improves the dependability of a VPP\u2019s capacity, which was historically a major concern for grid operators.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a roof-top solar panel.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b3240\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-roof-top-solar-panel.jpg?id=62288941&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">While solar panels have advanced, VPPs have been held back by a lack of similar advancement in the needed software until recently.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sunrun</small></p><p>Cybersecurity and interoperability standards are still evolving. Interconnection processes and data visibility in many areas aren\u2019t consistent, making it hard to monitor and coordinate distributed resources effectively. In short, while the technology and economics for VPPs are firmly in place, there\u2019s work yet to be done aligning regulation, infrastructure, and market design.</p><p>On top of technical and cost constraints, VPPs have long been held back by regulations that prevented them from participating in energy markets like traditional generators. SolarEdge recently <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029315871/en/SolarEdge-Surpasses-500-MWh-of-Storage-in-Virtual-Power-Plants-Across-16-U.S.-States-Canada-and-Puerto-Rico\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> enrollment of more than 500 megawatt-hours of residential battery storage in its VPP programs. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamarasinensky/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tamara Sinensky</a>, the company\u2019s senior manager of grid services, says the biggest hurdle to achieving this milestone wasn\u2019t technical\u2014it was regulatory program design.</p><p>California\u2019s Demand Side Grid Support (<a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/demand-side-grid-support-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DSGS</a>) program, launched in mid-2022, pays homes, businesses, and VPPs to reduce electricity use or discharge energy during grid emergencies. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a massive increase in our VPP enrollments primarily driven by the DSGS program,\u201d says Sinensky. Similarly, Sunrun\u2019s Northern California VPP delivered 535 megawatts of power from home-based batteries to the grid in July, and saw a <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/sunrun-sees-400-growth-in-virtual-power-plant-participation/805169/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">400 percent increase</a> in VPP participation from last year.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-order-no-2222-explainer-facilitating-participation-electricity-markets-distributed-energy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FERC Order 2222</a>, issued in 2020, requires regional grid operators to allow VPPs to sell power, reduce load, or provide grid services directly to wholesale market operators, and get paid the same market price as a traditional power plant for those services. However, many states and grid regions don\u2019t yet have a process in place to comply with the FERC order. And because utilities profit from grid expansion and not VPP deployment, they\u2019re not incentivized to integrate VPPs into their operations. Utilities \u201cview customer batteries as competition,\u201d says Heavner.</p><p>According to Nasiri, VPPs would have a meaningful impact on the grid if they achieve a penetration of 2 percent of the market\u2019s peak power. \u201cLarger penetration of up to 5 percent for up to 4 hours is required to have a meaningful capacity impact for grid planning and operation,\u201d he says.</p><p>In other words, VPP operators have their work cut out for them in continuing to unlock the flexible capacity in homes, businesses, and EVs. Additional technical and policy advances could move VPPs from a niche reliability tool to a key power source and grid stabilizer for the energy tumult ahead.<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>"

He was of sound mind. But when it came to his health device, he couldn\u2019t find clear answers about where his data went, who could access it, or how to control it. The instructions were dense, and the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/protecting-online-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">privacy settings</a> were buried in multiple menus. So, he made what seemed like the safest choice: he unplugged it. That decision meant giving up real-time glucose monitoring that his doctor had recommended.</p><p>The healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) market is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iot-healthcare-market-worth-289-140000086.html\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> to exceed $289 billion by 2028, with older adults representing a major share of users. These devices are fall detectors, medication reminders, glucose monitors, heart rate trackers, and others that enable independent living. Yet there\u2019s a widening gap between deployment and adoption. According to an <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/personal-technology/companies-address-online-privacy-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\">AARP survey</a>, 34% of adults over 50 list privacy as a primary barrier to adopting health technology. That represents millions of people who could benefit from monitoring tools but avoid them because they don\u2019t feel safe.</p><p>In my study at the University of Denver\u2019s Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science, I surveyed 22 older adults and conducted in-depth interviews with nine participants who use health-monitoring devices. The findings revealed a critical engineering failure: 82% understood security concepts like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/two-factor-authentication-sandia-labs\" target=\"_blank\">two-factor authentication</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/homomorphic-encryption\" target=\"_blank\">encryption</a>, yet only 14% felt confident managing their privacy when using these devices. In my research, I also evaluated 28 healthcare apps designed for older adults and found that 79% lacked basic breach-notification protocols.</p><p>One participant told me, \u201cI know there\u2019s encryption, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really enough to protect my data.\u201d Another said, \u201cThe thought of my health data getting into the wrong hands is very concerning. I\u2019m particularly worried about identity theft or my information being used for scams.\u201d</p><p>This is not a user knowledge problem; it\u2019s an engineering problem. We\u2019ve built systems that demand technical expertise to operate safely, then handed them to people managing complex health needs while navigating age-related changes in vision, cognition, and dexterity.</p><h2>Measuring the Gap</h2><p>To quantify the issues with privacy setting transparency, I developed the Privacy Risk Assessment Framework (PRAF), a tool that scores healthcare apps across five critical domains.</p><p>First, the regulatory compliance domain evaluates whether apps explicitly state adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or other data protection standards. Just claiming to be compliant is not enough\u2014they must provide verifiable evidence.</p><p>Second, the security mechanisms<strong> </strong>domain assesses the implementation of encryption, access controls, and, most critically, breach-notification protocols that alert users when their data may have been compromised. Third, in the usability and accessibility domain, the tool examines whether privacy interfaces are readable and navigable for people with age-related visual or cognitive changes. Fourth, data-minimization practices evaluate whether apps collect only necessary information and clearly specify retention periods. Finally, third-party sharing transparency measures whether users can easily understand who has access to their data and why.</p><p>When I applied PRAF to 28 healthcare apps commonly used by older adults, the results revealed systemic gaps. Only 25% explicitly stated HIPAA compliance, and just 18% mentioned GDPR compliance. Most alarmingly, 79% lacked breach notification protocols, which means that the users may never find out if their data was compromised. The average privacy policy readability scored at a 12th-grade level, even though <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16541986/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research shows</a> that the average reading level of older adults is at an 8th grade level<strong>. </strong>Not a single app included accessibility accommodations in their privacy interfaces.</p><p>Consider what happens when an older adult opens a typical health app. They face a multi-page privacy policy full of legal terminology about \u201cdata controllers\u201d and \u201cprocessing purposes,\u201d followed by settings scattered across multiple menus. One participant told me, \u201cThe instructions are hard to understand, the print is too small, and it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d Another explained, \u201cI don\u2019t feel adequately informed about how my data is collected, stored, and shared. It seems like most of these companies are after profit, and they don\u2019t make it easy for users to understand what\u2019s happening with their data.\u201d</p><p>When protection requires a manual people can\u2019t read, two outcomes follow: they either skip security altogether leaving themselves vulnerable, or abandon the technology entirely, forfeiting its health benefits.</p><h2>Engineering for privacy</h2><p>We need to treat trust as an engineering specification, not a marketing promise. Based on my research findings and the specific barriers older adults face, three approaches address the root causes of distrust.</p><p>The first approach is adaptive security defaults. Rather than requiring users to navigate complex configuration menus, devices should ship with pre-configured best practices that automatically adjust to data sensitivity and device type. A fall detection system doesn\u2019t need the same settings as a continuous glucose monitor. This approach draws from the principle of \u201csecurity by default\u201d in systems engineering.</p><p>Biometric or voice authentication can replace passwords that are easily forgotten or written down. The key is removing the burden of expertise while maintaining strong protection. As one participant put it: \u201cSimplified security settings, better educational resources, and more intuitive user interfaces will be beneficial.\u201d</p><p>The second approach is real-time transparency<strong>.</strong> Users shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings to see where their data goes. Instead, notification systems should show each data access or sharing event in plain language. For example: \u201cYour doctor accessed your heart-rate data at 2 p.m. to review for your upcoming appointment.\u201d A single dashboard should summarize who has access and why.</p><p>This addresses a concern that came up repeatedly in my interviews: users want to know who is seeing their data and why. The engineering challenge here isn\u2019t technical complexity, it\u2019s designing interfaces that convey technical realities in language anyone can understand. Such systems already exist in other domains; banking apps, for instance, send immediate notifications for every transaction. The same principle applies to health data, where the stakes are arguably higher.</p><p>The third approach is invisible security updates. Manual patching creates vulnerability windows. Automatic, seamless updates should be standard for any device handling health data, paired with a simple status indicator so users can confirm protection at a glance. As one participant said, \u201cThe biggest issue that we as seniors have is the fact that we don\u2019t remember our passwords... The new technology is surpassing the ability of seniors to keep up with it.\u201d Automating updates removes a significant source of anxiety and risk.</p><h2>What\u2019s at Stake</h2><p>We can keep building healthcare IoT the way we have: fast, feature-rich, and fundamentally untrustworthy. Or, we can engineer systems that are transparent, secure, and usable by design. Trust isn\u2019t something you market through slogans or legal disclaimers. It\u2019s something you engineer, line by line, into the code itself.<strong> </strong>For older adults relying on technology to maintain independence, that kind of engineering matters more than any new feature we could add. Every unplugged glucose monitor, every abandoned fall detector, every health app deleted out of confusion or fear represents not just a lost sale but a missed opportunity to support someone\u2019s health and autonomy.</p><p>The challenge of privacy in healthcare IoT goes beyond fixing existing systems, it requires reimagining how we communicate privacy itself. My ongoing research builds on these findings through an AI-driven Data Helper, a system that uses large language models to translate dense legal privacy policies into short, accurate, and accessible summaries for older adults. By making data practices transparent and comprehension measurable, this approach aims to turn compliance into understanding and trust, thus advancing the next generation of trustworthy digital health systems.</p>"

To the north, Scottish wind farms have doubled their output over the past decade. In the south, where electricity demand is heaviest, electrification and new data centers promise to draw more power, but new generation is falling short. Construction on a new 3,280-megawatt nuclear power plant west of London lags years behind schedule.</p><p>The result is a lopsided flow of power that\u2019s maxing out transmission corridors from the Highlands to London. That grid strain won\u2019t ease any time soon. New lines linking Scotland to southern England are at least three to four years from operation, and at risk of further delays from fierce local opposition.</p><p>At the same time, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is bent on installing even more wind power and slashing fossil-fuel generation by 2030. His Labour government says low-carbon power is cheaper and more secure than natural gas, much of which comes from Norway via the world\u2019s longest underwater gas pipeline and is vulnerable to disruption and sabotage.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Map of transmission lines in southern Scotland and northern England.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1e710\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/map-of-transmission-lines-in-southern-scotland-and-northern-england.png?id=62286818&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The lack of transmission lines available to move power flowing south from Scottish wind farms has caused grid congestion in England. To better manage it, the U.K. has installed SmartValves at three substations in northern England\u2014Penwortham, Harker, and Saltholme\u2014and is constructing a fourth at South Shields. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chris Philpot </small></p>The U.K.\u2019s resulting grid congestion prevents transmission operators from delivering some of their cleanest, cheapest generation to all of the consumers who want it. Congestion is a perennial problem whenever power consumption is on the rise. It pushes circuits to their thermal limits and creates grid stability or security constraints.<p>With congestion relief needed now, the U.K.\u2019s grid operators are getting creative, rapidly tapping new cable designs and innovations in power electronics to squeeze more power through existing transmission corridors. These <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/grid-enhancing-technologies\" target=\"_self\">grid-enhancing technologies</a>, or GETs, present a low-cost way to bridge the gap until new lines can be built.</p><p>\u201cGETs allow us to operate the system harder before an investment arrives, and they save a s***load of money,\u201d says <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/julian-leslie-b9059535?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Julian Leslie</a>, chief engineer and director of strategic energy planning at the National Energy System Operator (NESO), the Warwick-based agency that directs U.K. energy markets and infrastructure.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A stone wall along a dirt trail with large powerlines running overhead on a sunny day \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3c272\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-stone-wall-along-a-dirt-trail-with-large-powerlines-running-overhead-on-a-sunny-day.jpg?id=62286810&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Transmission lines running across England\u2019s countryside are maxed out, creating bottlenecks in the grid that prevent some carbon-free power from reaching customers. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Vincent Lowe/Alamy </small></p><p>The U.K.\u2019s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment. Such innovation involves some risk, because an intervention anywhere on the U.K.\u2019s tightly meshed power system can have system-wide impacts. (Grid operators elsewhere are choosing to start with GETs at their systems\u2019 periphery\u2014where there\u2019s less impact if something goes wrong.)</p><p>The question is how far\u2014and how fast\u2014the U.K.\u2019s grid operators can push GETs capabilities. The new technologies still have a limited track record, so operators are cautiously feeling their way toward heavier investment. Power system experts also have unanswered questions about these advanced grid capabilities. For example, will they create more complexity than grid operators can manage in real time? Might feedback between different devices destabilize the grid?</p><p>There is no consensus yet as to how to even screen for such risks, let alone protect against them, says <a href=\"https://www.robinpreece.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Preece</a>, professor in future power systems at the University of Manchester, in England. \u201cWe\u2019re at the start of establishing that now, but we\u2019re building at the same time. So it\u2019s kind of this race between the necessity to get this technology installed as quickly as possible, and our ability to fully understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><h2>How is the U.K. Managing Grid Congestion?</h2><p>One of the most innovative and high-stakes tricks in the U.K.\u2019s toolbox employs electronic power-flow controllers, devices that shift electricity from jammed circuits to those with spare capacity. These devices have been able to finesse enough additional wind power through grid bottlenecks to replace an entire gas-fired generator. Installed in northern England four years ago by <a href=\"https://www.smartwires.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Wires</a>, based in Durham, N.C., these SmartValves are expected to help even more as NESO installs more of them and masters their capabilities.</p><p>Warwick-based <a href=\"https://www.nationalgrid.com/electricity-transmission\" target=\"_blank\">National Grid Electricity Transmission</a>, the grid operator for England and Wales, is adding SmartValves and also replacing several thousand kilometers of overhead wire with advanced conductors that can carry more current. And it\u2019s using a technique called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/dynamic-line-rating-grid-congestion\" target=\"_self\">dynamic line rating</a>, whereby sensors and models work together to predict when weather conditions will allow lines to carry extra current.</p><p>Other kinds of GETs are also being used globally. Advanced conductors are the most widely deployed. Dynamic line rating is increasingly common in European countries, and U.S. utilities are beginning to take it seriously. Europe also leads the world in topology-optimization software, which reconfigures power routes to alleviate congestion, and advanced power-flow-control devices like SmartValves.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers wearing hard hats and safety harnesses standing high up on an electricity pylon in the countryside\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4a9a9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-wearing-hard-hats-and-safety-harnesses-standing-high-up-on-an-electricity-pylon-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286977&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Engineers install dynamic line rating technology from the Boston-based company LineVision on National Grid\u2019s transmission network. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p>SmartValves\u2019 chops stand out at the Penwortham substation in Lancashire, England, one of two National Grid sites where the device made its U.K. debut in 2021. Penwortham substation is a major transmission hub, whose spokes desperately need congestion relief. Auditory evidence of heavy power flows was clear during my visit to the substation, which buzzes loudly. The sound is due to the electromechanical stresses on the substation\u2019s massive transformers, explains my guide, National Grid commissioned engineer Paul Lloyd.</p><p>Penwortham\u2019s transformers, circuits, and protective relays are spread over 15 hectares, sandwiched between pastureland and suburban homes near Preston, a small city north of Manchester. Power arrives from the north on two pairs of 400-kilovolt AC lines, and most of it exits southward via 400-kV and 275-kV double-circuit wires.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Power lines crossing a rural pasture, with an old fence in the foreground and a substation in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ce7e1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/power-lines-crossing-a-rural-pasture-with-an-old-fence-in-the-foreground-and-a-substation-in-the-background.jpg?id=62286959&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Transmission lines lead to the congested Penwortham substation, which has become a test-bed for GETs such as  SmartValves and dynamic line rating. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Peter Fairley </small></p><p>What makes the substation a strategic test-bed for GETs is its position just north of the U.K. grid\u2019s biggest bottleneck, known as Boundary B7a, which runs east to west across the island. Nine circuits traverse the B7a: the four AC lines headed south from Penwortham, four AC lines closer to Yorkshire\u2019s North Sea coast, and a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link offshore. In theory, those circuits can collectively carry 13.6 gigawatts across the B7a. But NESO caps its flow at several gigawatts lower to ensure that no circuits overload if any two lines turn off.</p><p>Such limits are necessary for grid reliability, but they are leaving terawatt-hours of wind power stranded in Scotland and increasing consumers\u2019 energy costs: an extra \u00a3196 million (US $265 million) in 2024 alone. The costs stem from NESO having to ramp up gas-fired generators to meet demand down south while simultaneously compensating wind-farm operators for curtailing their output, as required under U.K. policy.</p><p>So National Grid keeps tweaking Penwortham. In 2011 the substation got its first big GET: phase-shifting transformers (PSTs), a type of analog flow controller. PSTs adjust power flow by creating an AC waveform whose alternating voltage leads or lags its alternating current. They do so by each PST using a pair of connected transformers to selectively combine power from an AC transmission circuit\u2019s three phases. Motors reposition electrical connections on the transformer coils to adjust flows.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Large machines outdoors connected to power lines \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d09c1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/large-machines-outdoors-connected-to-power-lines.jpg?id=62286963&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Phase-shifting transformers (PSTs) were installed in 2012 at the Penwortham substation and are the analog predecessor to SmartValves. They\u2019re powerful but also bulky and relatively inflexible. It can take 10 minutes or more for the PST\u2019s motorized actuators at Penwortham to tap their full range of flow control, whereas SmartValves can shift within milliseconds.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p><span>Penwortham\u2019s pair of 540-tonne PSTs occupy the entire south end of the substation, along with their dedicated chillers, relays, and power supplies. Delivering all that hardware required extensive road closures and floating a huge barge up the adjacent River Ribble, an event that made national news.</span></p><p>The SmartValves at Penwortham stand in stark contrast to the PSTs\u2019 heft, complexity, and mechanics. SmartValves are a type of static synchronous series compensator, or SSSC\u2014a solid-state alternative to PSTs that employs power electronics to tweak power flows in milliseconds. I saw two sets of them tucked into a corner of the substation, occupying a quarter of the area of the PSTs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers on an elevated platform and tall, cylindrical machinery\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"146f3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-on-an-elevated-platform-and-tall-cylindrical-machinery.jpg?id=62286971&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The SmartValve V103 design [above] experienced some teething and reliability issues that were ironed out with the technology\u2019s next iteration, the V104.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            National Grid Electricity Transmission/Smart Wires        </small> </p><p>The SmartValves are first and foremost an insurance policy to guard against a potentially crippling event: the sudden loss of one of the B7a\u2019s 400-kV lines. If that were to happen, gigawatts of power would instantly seek another route over neighboring lines. And if it happened on a windy day, when lots of power is streaming in from the north, the resulting surge could overload the 275-kV circuits headed from Penwortham to Liverpool. The SmartValves\u2019 job is to save the day.</p><p>They do this by adding impedance to the 275-kV lines, thus acting to divert more power to the remaining 400-kV lines. This rerouting of power prevents a blackout that could potentially cascade through the grid. The upside to that protection is that NESO can safely schedule an additional 350 MW over the B7a.</p><p>The savings add up. \u201cThat\u2019s 350 MW of wind you\u2019re no longer curtailing from wind farms. So that\u2019s 350 times \u00a3100 a megawatt-hour,\u201d says Leslie, at NESO. \u201cThat\u2019s also 350 MW of gas-fired power that you don\u2019t need to replace the wind. So that\u2019s 350 times \u00a3120 a megawatt-hour. The numbers get big quickly.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266637500\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Osborne</a>, the National Grid lead asset life-cycle engineer managing its SmartValve projects, estimates the devices are saving U.K. customers over \u00a3100 million (US $132 million) a year. At that rate, they\u2019ll pay for themselves \u201cwithin a few years,\u201d Osborne says. By utility standards, where investments are normally amortized over decades, that\u2019s \u201calmost immediately,\u201d he adds.</p><h2>How Do Grid-Enhancing Technologies Work?</h2><p>The way Smart Wires\u2019 SSSC devices adjust power flow is based on emulating impedance, which is a strange beast created by AC power. An AC flow\u2019s changing magnetic field induces an additional voltage in the line\u2019s conductor, which then acts as a drag on the initial field. Smart Wires\u2019 SSSC devices alter power flow by emulating that natural process, effectively adding or subtracting impedance by adding their own voltage wave to the line. Adding a wave that leads the original voltage wave will boost flow, while adding a lagging wave will reduce flow.</p><p>The SSSC\u2019s submodules of capacitors and high-speed insulated-gate bipolar transistors operate in sequence to absorb power from a line and synthesize its novel impedance-altering waves. And thanks to its digital controls and switches, the device can within milliseconds flip from maximum power push to maximum pull.</p><p>You can trace the development of SSSCs to the advent of HVDC transmission in the 1950s. HVDC converters take power from an AC grid and efficiently convert it and transfer it over a DC line to another point in the same grid, or to a neighboring AC grid. In 1985, Narain Hingorani, an HVDC expert at the Palo Alto\u2013based Electric Power Research Institute, showed that similar converters could modulate the flow of an AC line. Four years later, Westinghouse engineer Laszlo Gyugyi proposed SSSCs, which became the basis for Smart Wires\u2019 boxes.</p><p>Major power-equipment manufacturers tried to commercialize SSSCs in the early 2000s. But utilities had little need for flow control back then because they had plenty of conventional power plants that could meet local demand when transmission lines were full.</p><p>The picture changed as solar and wind generation exploded and conventional plants began shutting down. In years past, grid operators addressed grid congestion by turning power plants on or off in strategic locations. But as of 2024, the U.K. had shut down all of its coal-fired power plants\u2014save one, which now burns wood\u2014and it has vowed to slash gas-fired generation from about a quarter of electricity supply in 2024 to at most 5 percent in 2030.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">The U.K.\u2019s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment.</p><p>To seize the emerging market opportunity presented by changing grid operations, Smart Wires had to make a crucial technology upgrade: ditching transformers. The company\u2019s first SSSC, and those from other suppliers, relied on a transformer to absorb lightning, voltage surges, and every other grid assault that could fry their power electronics. This made them bulky and added cost. So Smart Wires engineers set to work in 2017 to see if they could live without the transformer, says Frank Kreikebaum, Smart Wires\u2019s interim chief of engineering. Two years later the company had assembled a transformerless electronic shield. It consisted of a suite of filters and diverters, along with a control system to activate them. Ditching the transformer produced a trim, standardized product\u2014a modular system-in-a-box.</p><p>SmartValves work at any voltage and are generally ganged together to achieve a desired level of flow control. They can be delivered fast, and they fit in the kinds of tight spaces that are common in substations. \u201cIt\u2019s not about cost, even though we\u2019re competitive there. It\u2019s about \u2018how quick\u2019 and \u2018can it fit,\u2019\u201d says Kreikebaum.</p><p>And if the grid\u2019s pinch point shifts? The devices can be quickly moved to another substation. \u201cIt\u2019s a Lego-brick build,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-wilkes/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Owen Wilkes</a>, National Grid\u2019s director of network design. Wilkes\u2019s team decides where to add equipment based on today\u2019s best projections, but he appreciates the flexibility to respond to unexpected changes.</p><p>National Grid\u2019s deployments in 2021 were the highest-voltage installation of SSSCs at the time, and success there is fueling expansion. National Grid now has packs of SmartValves installed at three substations in northern England and under construction at another, with five more installations planned in that area. Smart Wires has also commissioned commercial projects at transmission substations in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and the United States.</p><h2>Dynamic Line Rating Boosts Grid Efficiency</h2><p>In addition to SSSCs, National Grid has deployed lidar that senses sag on Penwortham\u2019s 275-kV lines\u2014an indication that they\u2019re starting to overheat. The sensors are part of a dynamic line rating system and help grid operators maximize the amount of current that high-voltage lines can carry based on near-real-time weather conditions. (Cooler weather means more capacity.) Now the same technology is being deployed across the B7a\u2014a \u00a31 million investment that is projected to save consumers \u00a333 million annually, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/corin-ireland-4040b2179/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Corin Ireland</a>, a National Grid optimization engineer with the task of seizing GETs opportunities.</p><p>There\u2019s also a lot of old conductor wires being swapped out for those that can carry more power. National Grid\u2019s business plan calls for 2,416 kilometers of such reconductoring over the coming five years, which is about 20 percent of its system. Scotland\u2019s transmission operators are busy with their own big swaps.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rural farmland with shape and rotating wind turbines \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"80b0b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rural-farmland-with-shape-and-rotating-wind-turbines.jpg?id=62286812&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Scottish wind farms have doubled their power output over the past decade, but it often gets stranded due to grid congestion in England.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Andreas Berthold/Alamy        </small> </p><p>But while National Grid and NESO are making some of the boldest deployments of GETs in the world, they\u2019re not fully tapping the technologies\u2019 capabilities. That\u2019s partly due to the conservative nature of power utilities, and partly because grid operators already have plenty to keep their eyes on. It also stems from the unknowns that still surround GETs, like whether they might take the grid in unforeseen directions if allowed to respond automatically, or get stuck in a feedback loop responding to each other. Imagine SmartValve controllers at different substations fighting, with one substation jumping to remove impedance that the other just added, causing fluctuating power flows.</p><p>\u201cThese technologies operate very quickly, but the computers in the control room are still very reliant on people making decisions,\u201d says Ireland. \u201cSo there are time scales that we have to take into consideration when planning and operating the network.\u201d</p><p>This kind of conservative dispatching leaves value on the table. For example, the dynamic line rating models can spit out new line ratings every 15 minutes, but grid operators get updates only every 24 hours. Fewer updates means fewer opportunities to tap the system\u2019s ability to boost capacity. Similarly, for SmartValves, NESO activates installations at only one substation at a time. And control-room operators turn them on manually, even though the devices could automatically respond to faults within milliseconds.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers in harnesses and hard hats climbing and standing high up on a transmission tower in the countryside.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9e46e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-in-harnesses-and-hard-hats-climbing-and-standing-high-up-on-a-transmission-tower-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286819&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">National Grid is upgrading transmission lines dating as far back as the 1960s.

For example, when Penwortham is adding impedance to push megawatts off the 275-kV lines, a set closer to Scotland could simultaneously pull the power north, nudging the sum over to the B7a\u2019s eastern circuits. Simulations by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hiorns-6a92b158/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Hiorns</a>, a former National Grid planning director who consults for Smart Wires, suggest that this kind of cooperative action should increase the B7a circuits\u2019 usable capacity by another 250 to 300 MW. \u201cYou double the effectiveness by using them as pairs,\u201d he says.</p><p>Operating multiple flow controllers may become necessary for unlocking the next boundary en route to London, south of the B7a, called Boundary B8. As dynamic line rating, beefier conductors, and SmartValves send more power across the B7a, lines traversing B8 are reaching their limits.

Charette can be pretty depressing. Charette, who has been writing about software failures for this magazine for the past 20 years, is a renowned risk analyst and systems expert who over the course of a 50-year career has seen more than his share of delusional thinking among IT professionals, government officials, and corporate executives, before, during, and after massive software failures.</p><p>In 2005\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">Why Software Fails</a>,\u201d in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, a seminal article documenting the causes behind large-scale software failures, Charette noted, \u201cThe biggest tragedy is that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-failure\" target=\"_self\">software failure</a> is for the most part predictable and avoidable. Unfortunately, most organizations don\u2019t see preventing failure as an urgent matter, even though that view risks harming the organization and maybe even destroying it. Understanding why this attitude persists is not just an academic exercise; it has tremendous implications for business and society.\u201d</p><p>Two decades and several trillion wasted dollars later, he finds that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures\" target=\"_blank\">people are making the same mistakes</a>. They claim their project is unique, so past lessons don\u2019t apply. They underestimate complexity. Managers come out of the gate with unrealistic budgets and timelines. Testing is inadequate<strong> </strong>or skipped entirely. Vendor promises that are too good to be true are taken at face value. Newer development approaches like DevOps or AI copilots are implemented without proper training or the organizational change necessary to make the most of them.</p><p>What\u2019s worse, the huge impacts of these missteps on end users aren\u2019t fully accounted for. When the Canadian government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aurO_LK6DEI\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix paycheck system</a> initially failed, for instance, the developers glossed over the protracted financial and emotional distress inflicted on tens of thousands of employees receiving erroneous paychecks; problems persist today, nine years later. Perhaps that\u2019s because, as Charette told me recently, IT project managers don\u2019t have professional licensing requirements and are rarely, if ever, held legally liable for software debacles.</p><p>While medical devices may seem a far cry from giant IT projects, they have a few things in common. As Special Projects Editor Stephen Cass uncovered in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/medical-device-recalls\" target=\"_blank\">The Data</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalls</a> on average 20 medical devices per month due to software issues.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity. We would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem having AWS go down.\u201d <strong>\u2014Robert N. Charette</strong></p><p>Like IT projects, medical devices face fundamental challenges posed by software complexity. Which means that testing, though rigorous and regulated in the medical domain, can\u2019t possibly cover every scenario or every line of code. The major difference between failed medical devices and failed IT projects is that a huge amount of liability attaches to the former.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re building software for medical devices, there are a lot more standards that have to be met and a lot more concern about the consequences of failure,\u201d Charette observes. \u201cBecause when those things don\u2019t work, there\u2019s tort law available, which means manufacturers are on the hook. It\u2019s much harder to bring a case and win when you\u2019re talking about an electronic payroll system.\u201d</p><p>Whether a software failure is hyperlocal, as when a medical device fails inside your body, or spread across an entire region, like when an airline\u2019s ticketing system crashes, organizations need to dig into the root causes and apply those lessons to the next device or IT project if they hope to stop history from repeating itself.</p><p>\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity,\u201d Charette says. \u201cWe would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem accepting AWS going down or telcos or banks going out.\u201d He lets out a heavy sigh worthy of A.A. Milne\u2019s Eeyore. \u201cPeople just kind of shrug their shoulders.\u201d</p>"

Yet engineering\u2019s impact lies not only in technical advancement but also in its ability to serve the greater good. This foundational principle is behind IEEE\u2019s public imperative initiatives which apply our efforts and expertise to support our mission to advance technology for humanity with a direct benefit to society. </p><h2>Serving society </h2><p>Public imperative activities and initiatives serve society by promoting understanding, impact for humans and our environment, and responsible use of science and technology. These initiatives encompass a wide range of efforts, including<a href=\"https://move.ieeeusa.org/about/stem-outreach/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> STEM outreach</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeht.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> humanitarian technology deployments</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeusa.org/public-policy/priorities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> public education on emerging technologies</a>, and<a href=\"https://sustainable-climate.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> sustainability</a>. Unlike many efforts advancing technology, these initiatives are not designed with financial opportunity in mind. Instead, they fulfill IEEE\u2019s designation as a 501(c)(3) public charity engaged in scientific and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/microcredentials\" target=\"_blank\">educational activities</a> for the benefit of the engineering community and the public.</p><h3>Building a Better World</h3><br /><p>Across the globe, IEEE members and volunteers dedicate their time and use their talents, experiences, and expertise to lead, organize, and drive activities to advance technology for humanity. The<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/social-impact-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Social Impact</a> report showcases a selection of recent projects and initiatives that support that mission.</p><p>In my March column, I described my vision for One IEEE, which is aimed at empowering IEEE\u2019s diverse units to work together in ways that magnify their individual and collective impact. Within the framework of One IEEE, public imperative activities are not peripheral; they are central to unifying the organization and amplifying our global relevance. Across IEEE\u2019s varied regions, societies, and technical communities, these activities align efforts around a shared mission. They provide our members from different disciplines and geographies the opportunity to collaborate on projects that transcend boundaries, fostering interdisciplinary innovation and global stewardship.</p><p>Such activities also offer members opportunities to apply their technical expertise in service of societal needs. Whether<a href=\"https://ctu.ieee.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> finding innovative solutions to connect the unconnected</a> or developing<a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> open-source educational tools for students</a>, we are solving real-world problems. The initiatives transform abstract technical knowledge into actionable solutions, reinforcing the idea that technology is not just about building systems\u2014it\u2019s about building futures.</p><p>For our <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-student-projects\" target=\"_blank\">young professionals and students</a>, these activities offer hands-on experiences that connect technical skills with real-world applications, inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in engineering with purpose and passion. These activities also create mentorship opportunities, leadership pathways, and a sense of belonging within the wider IEEE community.</p><h2>Principled tech leader</h2><p>In an age when technology influences practically every aspect of life\u2014from health care and energy to communication and transportation\u2014IEEE must, as a leading technical authority, also serve as a socially responsible leader. Public imperative activities include IEEE\u2019s commitment to ethical development, university and pre-university education, and accessible innovation. They help bridge the gap between technical communities and the public, working to ensure that engineering solutions are accessible, equitable, and aligned with societal values.</p><p>From a strategic standpoint, public imperatives also support IEEE\u2019s long-term sustainability. The organization is redesigning its budget process to emphasize aligning financial resources with mission-driven goals. One of the guiding principles is to publicize IEEE\u2019s public charity status and invest accordingly.</p><p>That means promoting our public imperatives in funding decisions, integrating them into operational planning, and measuring their outcomes with engineering rigor. By treating these activities as core infrastructure, IEEE ensures that its resources are deployed in ways that maximize public benefit and organizational impact.</p><p>Public imperatives are vital to the success of One IEEE. They embody the organization\u2019s mission, unify its global membership, and demonstrate the societal relevance of engineering and technology. They offer our members the opportunity to apply their skills in meaningful ways, contribute to public good, and shape the future of technology with integrity.</p><p>Through our public imperative activities, IEEE is a force for innovation and a driver of meaningful impact.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201c<span>Engineering With Purpose</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1539517486772872\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public Facebook group</a> dedicated to sharing negative experiences with the G7 has grown to thousands of users, and several class action <a href=\"https://rosenlegal.com/case/dexcom-inc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuits</a> have been filed against the company, alleging <a href=\"https://wilshirelawfirm.com/dexcom-class-action-lawsuit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">false advertising</a> and <a href=\"https://cowperlaw.com/cowper-law-llp-dicello-levitt-file-class-action-against-dexcom-over-misleading-claims-about-g7-cgm/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">misleading claims</a> about device accuracy. </p><p>Yet, based on a standard metric in the industry, the G7 is one of the most accurate glucose sensors available. \u201cAccuracy in the performance of our device is our number one priority. We understand this is a lifesaving device for people with Type 1 diabetes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-c-simpson-533a083/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Simpson</a>, Dexcom\u2019s senior vice president of innovation and sensor technology, told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>. Simpson acknowledged some variability in individual sensors, but stood by the accuracy of the devices.</p><p>So why have users faced issues? In part, metrics used in marketing can be misleading compared to real world performance. Differences in study design, combined with complex biological realities, mean that the accuracy of these biosensors can\u2019t be boiled down to one number\u2014and users are learning this the hard way. </p><h2>Dexcom\u2019s Glucose Monitors</h2><p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) typically consist of a small filament inserted under the skin, a transmitter, and a receiver. The filament is coated with an enzyme that generates an electrical signal when it reacts with glucose in the fluid surrounding the body\u2019s cells. That signal is then converted to a digital signal and processed to generate glucose readings every few minutes. Each sensor lasts a week or two before needing to be replaced. <strong></strong></p><p>The technology has come a long way in recent years. In the 2010s, these devices required blood glucose calibrations twice a day and still weren\u2019t reliable enough to dose insulin based on the readings. Now, some insulin pumps use the near-real-time data to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-pancreas-could-conquer-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">automatically make adjustments</a>. With those improvements has come greater trust in the data users receive\u2014and higher standards. A faulty reading could result in a dangerous dose of insulin. </p><p>The G7 introduced several changes to Dexcom\u2019s earlier designs, including a much smaller footprint, and updated the algorithm used to translate sensor signals into glucose readings for better accuracy, Simpson says. \u201cFrom a performance perspective, we did demonstrate in a clinical trial that the G7 is significantly more accurate than the G6,\u201d he says. </p><p>So Heller and others were surprised when the new Dexcom sensor seemed to be performing worse. For some batches of sensors, it\u2019s possible that the issue was in part due to an unvalidated change in a component used in a resistive layer of the sensors. The new component showed worse performance, according to a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dexcom-inc-700835-03042025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warning letter</a> issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2025, following an audit of two U.S. manufacturing sites. The material has since been removed from all G7 sensors, Simpson says, and the company is continuing to work with the FDA to address concerns. (\u201cThe warning letter does not restrict Dexcom\u2019s ability to produce, market, manufacture or distribute products, require recall of any products, nor restrict our ability to seek clearance of new products,\u201d Dexcom added in a statement.)</p><p>\u201c<span>There is a distribution of accuracies that have to do with people\u2019s physiology and also the devices themselves. Even in our clinical studies, we saw some that were really precise and some that had a little bit of inaccuracy to them,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cBut in general, our sensor is very accurate.\u201d</span></p><p><span>In late November Abbott\u2014one of Dexcom\u2019s main competitors\u2014<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts/early-alert-glucose-monitor-sensor-issue-abbott-diabetes-care\" target=\"_blank\">recalled some of its CGMs</a> due to inaccurate low glucose readings. The recall affects approximately 3 million sensors and was caused by an issue with one of Abbott\u2019s production lines. </span></p><p>The discrepancy between reported accuracy and user experience, however, goes beyond any one company\u2019s manufacturing missteps. </p><h2>Does MARD Matter? </h2><p>The accuracy of CGM systems is frequently measured via \u201cmean absolute relative difference,\u201d or MARD, a percentage that compares the sensor readings to laboratory blood glucose measurements. The lower the MARD, the more accurate the sensor. </p><p>This number is often used in advertising and marketing, and it has a historical relevance, says <a href=\"https://de.linkedin.com/in/manueich/de\" target=\"_blank\">Manuel Eichenlaub</a>, a biomedical engineer at the <a href=\"https://www.ifdt-ulm.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Diabetes Technology Ulm</a> in Germany, where he and his colleagues conduct independent CGM performance studies. For years, there was <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2023.0435\" target=\"_blank\">a general belief</a> that a MARD under 10 percent meant a system would be accurate enough to be used for insulin dosing. In 2018, the FDA established a specific set of accuracy <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-862/subpart-B/section-862.1355\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a> beyond MARD for insulin-guiding glucose monitors, including Dexcom\u2019s. But manufacturers design the clinical trials that determine accuracy metrics, and the way studies are designed can make a big difference. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graph comparing readings from two glucose monitors from 12 AM to 2:24 PM.

But glucose levels vary across blood compartments in the body; blood collected from capillaries with a finger prick fluctuates more and can have glucose levels around 5 to 10 percent higher than venous blood. (Dexcom tests against a gold-standard venous blood analyzer. When users see inaccuracies against home meters that use capillary blood, it could in part be a reflection of the meter\u2019s own inaccuracy, Simpson says, though he acknowledges real inaccuracies in CGMs as well.)</p><p>Additionally, the distribution of sampling isn\u2019t standardized. CGMs are known to be less accurate at the beginning and end of use, or when glucose levels are out of range or changing quickly. That means measured accuracy could be skewed by taking fewer samples right after a meal or late in the CGM\u2019s lifetime. </p><p>According to Simpson, Dexcom\u2019s trial protocol meets the FDA\u2019s expectation and tests the devices in different blood sugar ranges across the life of the sensor. \u201cWithin these clinical trials, we do stress the sensors to try and simulate those real world conditions,\u201d he says. </p><p>Dexcom and other companies advertise a MARD around 8 percent. But some independent studies are more demanding and find higher numbers; a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19322968251315459\" target=\"_blank\">head-to-head study of three popular CGMs</a> that Eichenlaub led found MARD values closer to 10 percent or higher.</p><p><span>Eichenlaub and other CGM experts believe that more standardization of testing and an extension of the FDA requirements are necessary, so they <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898125006072\" target=\"_blank\">recently proposed comprehensive guidelines</a> on CGM performance testing. </span><span>In the United States and Europe</span><span>, a few manufacturers currently dominate the market. But</span><span> newer players are entering the growing market and, especially in Europe,</span><span> may not meet the same standards as legacy manufacturers, he says</span><span>. \u201cHaving a standardized way of evaluating the performance of those systems is very important.\u201d</span></p><p>For users like Heller though, better accuracy only matters if it yields better diabetes management. \u201cI don\u2019t care about MARD. I want data that is reliably <em><em>actionable</em></em>,\u201d Heller says. He encourages engineers working on these devices to think like the patient. \u201cAt some point, there\u2019s quantitative data, but you need qualitative data.\u201d </p>"

An expert in AI and machine learning, the IEEE senior member worked on Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bing</a> search engine before moving to Amazon. He also developed several features for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Teams</a>, the company\u2019s direct messaging platform.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working in AI for more than 20 years now,\u201d he says. \u201dSeeing how much we can do with technology still amazes me.\u201d</p><p>He shares his expertise and passion for the technology as an active member and volunteer at the <a href=\"https://ieee-seattle.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Seattle Section</a>. He organizes and hosts career development workshops that teach people to create an AI agent, which can perform tasks autonomously with minimal human oversight.</p><h2>An AI career inspired by a computer</h2><p>Agrawal was born and raised in Chirgaon, a remote village in Uttar Pradesh, India. When he was growing up, no one in Chirgaon had a computer. His family owned a pharmacy, which Agrawal was expected to join after he graduated from high school. Instead, his uncle and older brother encouraged him to attend college and find his own passion.</p><p>He enjoyed mathematics and physics, and he decided to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in statistics at the <a href=\"https://www.allduniv.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Allahabad</a>. After graduating in 1996, he pursued a master\u2019s degree<strong> </strong>in statistics, statistical quality control, and operations research<strong> </strong>at the <a href=\"https://www.isical.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Statistical Institute</a> in Kolkata.</p><p>While at the ISI, he saw a computer for the first time in the laboratory of <a href=\"https://www.isical.ac.in/~nikhil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nikhil R. Pal</a>, an electronics and communication sciences professor. Pal worked on identifying abnormal clumps of cells in mammogram images using the<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/413225/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> fuzzy c-means model</a>, a data-clustering technique employing a machine learning algorithm.</p><p>Agrawal earned his master\u2019s degree in 1998. He was so inspired by Pal\u2019s work, he says, that he stayed on at the university to earn a second master\u2019s degree, in computer science.</p><p>After graduating in 2001, he joined <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Novell</a> as a senior software engineer working out of its Bengaluru office in India. He helped develop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFolder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">iFolder</a>, a storage platform that allows users across different computers to back up, access, and manage their files.</p><p>After four years, Agrawal left Novell to join Microsoft as a software design engineer, working at the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/hyderabad-campus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hyderabad campus</a> in India. He was part of a team developing a system to upgrade Microsoft\u2019s software from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">XP</a> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vista</a>.</p><p>Two years later, he was transferred to the group developing Bing, a replacement for Microsoft\u2019s Live Search, which had been launched in 2006.</p><h2>Improving Microsoft\u2019s search engine</h2><p>Live Search had a traffic rate of less than 2 percent and struggled to keep up with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>\u2019s faster-paced, more user-friendly system, Agrawal says. He was tasked with improving search results but, Agrawal says, he and his team didn\u2019t have enough user search data to train their machine learning model.</p><p>Data for location-specific queries, such as nearby coffee shops or restaurants, was especially important, he says.</p><p>To overcome those challenges, the team used deterministic algorithms to create a more structured search. Such algorithms give the same answers for any query that uses the same specific terms. The process gets results by taking keywords\u2014such as locations, dates, and prices\u2014and finding them on webpages. To help the search engine understand what users need, Agrawal developed a query clarifier that asked them to refine their search. The machine learning tool then ranked the results from most to least relevant.</p><p>To test new features before they were launched, Agrawal and his team built an online A/B experimentation platform. Controlled tests were completed on different versions of the products, and the platform ran performance and user engagement metrics, then it produced a scorecard to show changes for updated features.</p><p>Bing launched in 2009 and is now the world\u2019s second-largest search engine, according to<a href=\"https://blackraven.digital/the-rise-of-bing-and-how-it-differs-from-google/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Black Raven</a>.</p><p>Throughout his 10 years of working on the system, Agrawal upgraded it. He also worked with the advertising department to improve Microsoft\u2019s services on Bing. Ads relevant to a person\u2019s search are listed among the search results.</p><p>\u201cThe work seems easy,\u201d Agrawal says, \u201cbut behind every search engine are hundreds of engineers powering ads, query formulations, rankings, relevance, and location detection.\u201d</p><h2>Testing products before launch </h2><p>Agrawal was promoted to software development manager in 2010. Five years later he was transferred to Microsoft\u2019s Seattle offices. At the time, the company was deploying new features for existing platforms without first testing them to ensure effectiveness. Instead, they measured their performance after release, Agrawal says, and that was wreaking havoc.</p><p>He proposed using his online A/B experimentation platform on all Microsoft products, not just Bing. His supervisor approved the idea. In six months Agrawal and his team modified the tool for company-wide use. Thanks to the platform, he says, Microsoft was able to smoothly deploy up-to-date products to users.</p><p>After another two years, he was promoted to principal engineering manager of Microsoft Teams, which was facing issues with user experience, he says.</p><p>\u201cMany employees received between 50 and 100 messages a day\u2014which became overwhelming for them,\u201d Agrawal says. To lessen the stress, he led a team that developed the system\u2019s first machine learning feature: Trending. It prioritized the five most important messages users should focus on. Agrawal also led the launch of incorporating emoji reactions, screen sharing, and video calls for Teams.</p><p>In 2020 he was ready for new experiences, he says, and he left Microsoft to join Amazon as an engineering leader.</p><h2>Improved Amazon shopping</h2><p>Agrawal led an Amazon team that manually collected information about products from the company\u2019s retail catalog to create a glossary. The data, which included product dimensions, color, and manufacturer, was used to standardize the language found in product descriptions to keep listings more consistent.</p><p>That is especially important when it comes to third-party sellers, he notes. Sellers listing a product had been entering as much or as little information as they wanted. Agrawal built a system that automatically suggests language from the glossary as the seller types.</p><p>He also developed an AI algorithm that utilizes the glossary\u2019s terminology to refine search results based on what a user types into the search bar. When a shopper types \u201cred mixer,\u201d for example, the algorithm lists products under the search bar that match the description. The shopper can then click on a product from the list.</p><p>In 2023 the retailer\u2019s catalog became too large for Agrawal and his team to collect information manually, so they built an AI tool to do it for them. It became the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Catalog AI system.</p><p>After gathering information about products from around the Web, Catalog AI uses large language models to update Amazon listings with missing information, correct errors, and rewrite titles and product specifications to make them clearer for the customer, Agrawal says.</p><p>The company expects the AI tool to increase sales this year by US $7.5 billion, according to a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/amazons-ai-wants-own-online-shopping-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News report</a> in July.</p><h2>Finding purpose at IEEE</h2><p>Since Agrawal joined IEEE last December, he has been elevated to senior member and has become an active volunteer.</p><p>\u201cBeing part of IEEE has opened doors for collaboration, mentorship, and professional growth,\u201d he says. \u201cIEEE has strengthened both my technical knowledge and my leadership skills, helping me progress in my career.\u201d</p><p>Agrawal is the social media chair of the IEEE Seattle Section. He is also vice chair of the <a href=\"https://cis.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computational Intelligence Society</a>.</p><p>He was a workshop cochair for the <a href=\"https://attend.ieee.org/neweraai25/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE New Era AI World Leaders Summit</a>, which was held from 5 to 7 December in Seattle. The event brought together government and industry leaders, as well as researchers and innovators working on AI, intelligent devices, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-weapons\" target=\"_self\">unmanned aerial vehicles</a>, and similar technologies. They explored how new tools could be used in cybersecurity, the medical field, and national disaster rescue missions.</p><p>Agrawal says he stays up to date on cutting-edge technologies by peer-reviewing 15 IEEE journals.</p><p>\u201cThe organization plays a very important role in bringing authenticity to anything that it does,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a journal article has the IEEE logo, you can believe that it was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-research-integrity-process\" target=\"_self\">thoroughly and diligently reviewed</a>.\u201d</p>"

Her early life unfolded in a world defined by scarcity\u2014rationed food, intermittent electricity, and a limited ability to move up or out. But she recalls that, amid the stifling insufficiencies, she was surrounded by an irrepressible warmth and intellectual curiosity\u2014even when she was making locomotive screws in a state-run factory as part of her school\u2019s curriculum.</p><p>\u201cLife was hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we had great teachers and strong communities.

His message was simple but electrifying, Rus says: Classical computer science had been solved. The next frontier, Hopcroft declared, was computations that interact with the messy physical world.</p><p>For Rus, the idea was a revelation.</p><p>\u201cIt was as if a door had opened,\u201d she says. \u201cI realized the future of computing wasn\u2019t just about logic and code; it was about how machines can perceive, move, and help us in the real world.\u201d</p><p>After the lecture, she introduced herself to Hopcroft and told him she wanted to learn from him. Not long after earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and mathematics in 1985, she applied to get a master\u2019s degree at Cornell, where Hopcroft became her graduate advisor. Rus developed algorithms there for dexterous <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/minimally-actuated-robot-arm-has-lots-of-joints-just-one-clever-motor\" target=\"_self\">robotic manipulation</a>\u2014teaching machines to grasp and move objects with precision. She earned her master\u2019s in computer science in 1990, then stayed on at Cornell to work toward a doctorate.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI like to think of robotics as a way to give people superpowers. Machines can help us reach farther, think faster, and live fuller lives.\u201d</p><p>In 1993 she earned her Ph.D. in computer science, then took a position as an assistant professor of computer science at <a href=\"https://home.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Dartmouth College</a>, in Hanover, N.H. She founded the college\u2019s robotics laboratory and expanded her work into distributed robotics. She developed teams of small robots that cooperated to perform tasks such as ensuring products in warehouses are correctly gathered to fulfill orders, get packaged safely, and are routed to their respective destinations efficiently.</p><p>Despite a lack of traditional machine shop facilities for fabrication on the Hanover campus, Rus found a way. She pioneered the use of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/printable-robots-mit-project\" target=\"_self\"> 3D printing to rapidly prototype and build robots</a>.</p><p>In 2003 she left Dartmouth to become a professor in the<a href=\"https://www.eecs.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> electrical engineering and computer science</a> department at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>.</p><p>The robotics lab she created at Dartmouth moved with her to MIT and became known as the <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Distributed Robotics Laboratory</a> (DRL). In 2012 she was named director of MIT\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school\u2019s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups including the DRL. She also continues to serve as the DRL\u2019s principal investigator.</p><h2>The science of physical intelligence</h2><p>Rus now leads pioneering research at the intersection of AI and robotics, a field she calls <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">physical intelligence</a>. It\u2019s \u201ca new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time,\u201d <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>.</p><p>Her lab builds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robots-for-hard-problems\" target=\"_self\">soft-body robots inspired by nature</a> that can sense, adapt, and learn. They are AI-driven systems that passively handle tasks\u2014such as self-balancing and complex articulation similar to that done by the human hand\u2014because their shape and materials minimize the need for heavy processing.</p><p>Such machines, she says, someday will be able to navigate different environments, perform useful functions without external control, and even recover from disturbances to their route planning. Researchers also are exploring ways to make them more energy-efficient.</p><p>One prototype developed by Rus\u2019s team is designed to retrieve foreign objects from the body, including batteries swallowed by children. The ingestible robots are artfully folded, similar to origami, so they are small enough to be swallowed. Embedded magnetic materials allow doctors to steer the soft robots and control their shape. Upon arriving in the stomach, a soft bot can be programmed to wrap around a foreign object and guide it safely out of the patient\u2019s body.</p><p>CSAIL researchers also are working on small robots that can carry a medication and release it at a specific area within the digestive tract, bypassing the stomach acid known to diminish some drugs\u2019 efficacy. Ingestible robots also could patch up internal injuries or ulcers. And because they\u2019re made from digestible materials such as sausage casings and biocompatible polymers, the robots can perform their assigned tasks and then get safely absorbed by the body, she says.</p><p>Health care isn\u2019t the only application on the horizon for such AI-driven technologies. Robots with physical intelligence might someday help firefighters locate people trapped in burning buildings, find miners after a cave-in, and provide valuable situational awareness information to emergency response teams in the aftermath of natural disasters, Rus says.</p><p>\u201cWhat excites me is the possibility of giving people new powers,\u201d she says. \u201cMachines that can think and move safely in the physical world will let us extend human reach\u2014at work, at home, in medicine \u2026 everywhere.\u201d</p><p>To make such a vision a reality, she has expanded her technical interests to include several complementary lines of research.</p><p>She\u2019s working on self-reconfiguring and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stochastic-robots-assemble-and-disassemble-themselves\" target=\"_self\">modular robots</a> such as MIT\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/m-blocks-modular-robotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M-Blocks</a> and NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/superbot-modular-multifunctional-reconfigurable-robot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SuperBots</a>, which can attach, detach, and rearrange themselves to form shapes suited for different actions such as slithering, climbing, and crawling.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nyu-tandon-robotics\" target=\"_self\">networked robots</a>\u2014including those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&amp;hvadid=675149237887&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13161685782168516493&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004281&amp;hvtargid=kwd-10573980&amp;ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&amp;hydadcr=28883_14649097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> uses in its warehouses\u2014thousands of machines can operate as a large adaptive system. The machines communicate continuously to divide tasks, avoid collisions, and optimize package routing.</p><p>Rus\u2019s team also is making advances in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/human-robot-interaction\" target=\"_self\">human-robot interaction</a>, such as reading brainwave activity and <a href=\"https://www.josephdelpreto.com/portfolio/detect-sign-language-with-a-smart-glove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interpreting sign language through a smart glove</a>.</p><p>To further her plan of putting all the computerized smarts the robots need within their physical bodies instead of in the cloud, she helped found <a href=\"https://www.liquid.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid AI</a> in 2023. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., develops <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/liquid-neural-networks\" target=\"_self\">liquid neural networks</a>, inspired by the simple brains of worms, that can learn and adapt continuously. The word <em><em>liquid</em></em> in this case refers to the adaptability, flexibility, and dynamic nature of the team\u2019s model architecture. It can change shape and adapt to new data inputs, and it fits within constraints imposed by the hardware in which it\u2019s contained, she says.</p><h2>Finding community in IEEE</h2><p>Rus joined IEEE at one of its robotics conferences when she was a graduate student.</p><p>\u201cI think I signed up just to get the student discount,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut IEEE turned out to be the place where my community lived.\u201d</p><p>She credits the organization\u2019s conferences, journals, and collaborative spirit with shaping her professional growth.</p><p>\u201cThe exchange of ideas, the chance to test your thinking against others\u2014it\u2019s invaluable,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s how our field moves forward.\u201d</p><p>Rus continues to serve on IEEE panels and committees, mentoring the next generation of roboticists.</p><p>\u201cIEEE gave me a platform,\u201d Rus says. \u201cIt taught me how to communicate, how to lead, and how to dream bigger.\u201d</p><h2>Living the American dream</h2><p>Looking back, Rus sees her story as a testament to unforeseen possibilities.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was growing up in Romania, I couldn\u2019t even imagine living in America,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I\u2019m here, working with brilliant students, building robots that help people, and trying to make a difference.

She is the principal investigator on a National Science Foundation\u2013funded project aimed at providing Long Beach residents with greater agency over the personal data their city collects.</p><p>She also identified a critical gap in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-city-emergency-response\" target=\"_blank\">smart city</a> design today: While cities may disclose how they collect data, they rarely offer ways to opt out. Shaffer spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum </em></em>about the experience of leading data walks, and about her research team\u2019s efforts to give citizens more control over the data collected by public technologies.</p><p><strong>What was the inspiration for your data walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gwen Shaffer: </strong>I began facilitating data walks in 2021. I was studying residents\u2019 comfort levels with city-deployed technologies that collect personally identifiable information. My first career as a political reporter has influenced my research approach. I feel strongly about conducting applied rather than theoretical research. And I always go into a study with the goal of helping to solve a real-world challenge and inform policy.</p><p><strong>How did you organize the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>We posted data privacy labels with a QR code that residents can scan and find out how their data are being used. Downtown, they\u2019re in Spanish and English. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia_Town,_Long_Beach,_California\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cambodia Town</a>, we did them in Khmer and English.</p><p><strong>What happened during the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>I\u2019ll give you one example. In a couple of the city-owned parking garages, there are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/privacy-concerns-grow-as-us-police-departments-turn-to-license-plate-readers\" target=\"_blank\">automated license-plate readers</a> at the entrance. So when I did the data walks, I talked to our participants about how they feel about those scanners. Because once they have your license plate, if you\u2019ve parked for fewer than two hours, you can breeze right through. You don\u2019t owe money.</p><p>Responses were contextual and sometimes contradictory. There were residents who said, \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s so convenient. It\u2019s a time saver.\u201d So I think that shows how residents are willing to make trade-offs. Intellectually, they hate the idea of the privacy violation, but they also love convenience.</p><p><strong>What surprised you most?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>One of the participants said, \u201cWhen I go to the airport, I can opt out of the facial scan and still be able to get on the airplane. But if I want to participate in so many activities in the city and not have my data collected, there\u2019s no option.\u201d</p><p>There was a<a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/city-of-long-beach-ca-cyberattack/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> cyberattack against the city in November 2023</a>. Even though we didn\u2019t have a prompt asking about it, people brought it up on their own in almost every focus group. One said, \u201cI would never connect to public Wi-Fi, especially after the city of Long Beach\u2019s site was hacked.\u201d</p><p><strong>What is the app your team is developing?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>Residents want agency. So that\u2019s what led my research team to connect with privacy engineers at <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, in Pittsburgh. <a href=\"https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sadeh-norman.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Sadeh</a> and his team had developed what they called the<a href=\"https://privacyassistant.org/iot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IoT Assistant</a>. So I told them about our project, and proposed adapting their app for city-deployed technologies. Our plan is to give residents the opportunity to exercise their rights under the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with this app. So they could say, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.passportinc.com/faq/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Passport Parking app</a>, delete all the data you\u2019ve already collected on me. And don\u2019t collect any more in the future.\u201d</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cGwen Shaffer.\u201d</em></p>"

What do you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong>Melanie Mitchell:</strong> Hopefully you noticed the quotation marks around \u201calien intelligences.\u201d I\u2019m quoting from a paper by [the neural network pioneer] <a href=\"https://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/\" target=\"_blank\">Terrence Sejnowski</a> where he talks about ChatGPT as <a href=\"https://papers.cnl.salk.edu/PDFs/Large%20Language%20Models%20and%20the%20Reverse%20Turing%20Test%202023-4640.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">being like a space alien</a> that can communicate with us and seems intelligent. And then there\u2019s another paper by the developmental psychologist <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Frank</a> who plays on that theme and says, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-023-00211-x\" target=\"_blank\">we in developmental psychology study alien intelligences</a>, namely babies. And we have some methods that we think may be helpful in analyzing AI intelligence. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m playing on.</p><p><strong>When people talk about evaluating intelligence in AI, what kind of intelligence are they trying to measure? Reasoning or abstraction or world modeling or something else?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> All of the above. People mean different things when they use the word intelligence, and intelligence itself has all these different dimensions, as you say. So, I used the term cognitive capabilities, which is a little bit more specific. I\u2019m looking at how different cognitive capabilities are evaluated in developmental and comparative psychology and trying to apply some principles from those fields to AI.</p><h2>Current Challenges in Evaluating AI Cognition</h2><p><strong>You say that the field of AI lacks good experimental protocols for evaluating cognition. What does AI evaluation look like today?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> The typical way to evaluate an AI system is to have some set of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarks</a>, and to run your system on those benchmark tasks and report the accuracy. But often it turns out that even though these AI systems we have now are just killing it on benchmarks, they\u2019re surpassing humans, that performance doesn\u2019t often translate to performance in the real world. If an AI system aces the bar exam, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a good lawyer in the real world. Often the machines are doing well on those particular questions but can\u2019t generalize very well. Also, tests that are designed to assess humans make assumptions that aren\u2019t necessarily relevant or correct for AI systems, about things like how well a system is able to memorize.</p><p>As a computer scientist, I didn\u2019t get any training in experimental methodology. Doing experiments on AI systems has become a core part of evaluating systems, and most people who came up through computer science haven\u2019t had that training.</p><p><strong>What do developmental and comparative psychologists know about probing cognition that AI researchers should know too?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> There\u2019s all kinds of experimental methodology that you learn as a student of psychology, especially in fields like developmental and comparative psychology because those are nonverbal agents. You have to really think creatively to figure out ways to probe them. So they have all kinds of methodologies that involve very careful control experiments, and making lots of variations on stimuli to check for robustness. They look carefully at failure modes, why the system [being tested] might fail, since those failures can give more insight into what\u2019s going on than success.</p><p><strong>Can you give me a concrete example of what these experimental methods look like in developmental or comparative psychology?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> One classic example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans\" target=\"_blank\">Clever Hans</a>. There was this horse, Clever Hans, who seemed to be able to do all kinds of arithmetic and counting and other numerical tasks. And the horse would tap out its answer with its hoof. For years, people studied it and said, \u201cI think it\u2019s real. It\u2019s not a hoax.\u201d But then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Pfungst\" target=\"_blank\">a psychologist</a> came around and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to think really hard about what\u2019s going on and do some control experiments.\u201d And his control experiments were: first, put a blindfold on the horse, and second, put a screen between the horse and the question asker. Turns out if the horse couldn\u2019t see the question asker, it couldn\u2019t do the task. What he found was that the horse was actually perceiving very subtle facial expression cues in the asker to know when to stop tapping. So it\u2019s important to come up with alternative explanations for what\u2019s going on. To be skeptical not only of other people\u2019s research, but maybe even of your own research, your own favorite hypothesis. I don\u2019t think that happens enough in AI.</p><p><strong>Do you have any case studies from research on babies?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> I have one case study where babies were <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06288.epdf?sharing_token=NaXcdNfjn_ktn5ri3QG45tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O8aD3KLw-45u9i6UpdAHsxWqm0w4l5z_rcCGu3oMzrydMb---fq01I0LBO5y_TRS_vrnUazfwqqCeiiPTOnsikTBil18Nzkcus3pGuA01UVQr-9DWge0nHwMu5X8gIJgjH90R2IqNR_-8WhIWaEnYnrp4uNLHP54XXfeAQ8FDjt23U-hFVTZg4liviDOMhx5rlatVpfpWvuJ20bMzUGaM8lAw7Q5ccGolZw_BrVmTM6frTBEOkijW7qIckKcTNQdT8gIkRtC2pNc_WiQDIENEvqe2L2Ko_9sZIOkJNoC3Qlg%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.smithsonianmag.com\" target=\"_blank\">claimed to have an innate moral sense</a>. The experiment showed them videos where there was a cartoon character trying to climb up a hill. In one case there was another character that helped them go up the hill, and in the other case there was a character that pushed them down the hill. So there was the helper and the hinderer. And the babies were assessed as to which character they liked better\u2014and they had a couple of ways of doing that\u2014and overwhelmingly they liked the helper character better. [Editor's note: The babies were 6 to 10 months old, and assessment techniques included seeing whether the babies reached for the helper or the hinderer.]</p><p>But another research group looked very carefully at these videos and found that in all of the helper videos, the climber who was being helped was excited to get to the top of the hill and bounced up and down. And so they said, \u201cWell, what if in the hinderer case we have the climber bounce up and down at the bottom of the hill?\u201d And that <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042698\" target=\"_blank\">completely turned around the results</a>. The babies always chose the one that bounced.</p><p>Again, coming up with alternatives, even if you have your favorite hypothesis, is the way that we do science. One thing that I\u2019m always a little shocked by in AI is that people use the word skeptic as a negative: \u201cYou\u2019re an LLM skeptic.\u201d But our job is to be skeptics, and that should be a compliment.</p><h2>Importance of Replication in AI Studies</h2><p><strong>Both those examples illustrate the theme of looking for counter explanations. Are there other big lessons that you think AI researchers should draw from psychology?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Well, in science in general the idea of replicating experiments is really important, and also building on other people\u2019s work. But that\u2019s sadly a little bit frowned on in the AI world. If you submit a paper to NeurIPS, for example, where you replicated someone\u2019s work and then you do some incremental thing to understand it, the reviewers will say, \u201cThis lacks novelty and it\u2019s incremental.\u201d That\u2019s the kiss of death for your paper. I feel like that should be appreciated more because that\u2019s the way that good science gets done.</p><p><strong>Going back to measuring cognitive capabilities of AI, there\u2019s lots of talk about how we can </strong><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/agi-benchmark\" target=\"_self\"><strong>measure progress towards AGI</strong></a><strong>. Is that a whole other batch of questions?</strong></p><p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Well, the term AGI is a little bit nebulous. People define it in different ways. I think it\u2019s hard to measure progress for something that\u2019s not that well defined. And our conception of it keeps changing, partially in response to things that happen in AI. In the old days of AI, people would talk about human-level intelligence and robots being able to do all the physical things that humans do. But people have looked at robotics and said, \u201cWell, okay, it\u2019s not going to get there soon. Let\u2019s just talk about what people call the cognitive side of intelligence,\u201d which I don\u2019t think is really so separable. So I am a bit of an AGI skeptic, if you will, in the best way.</p>"
