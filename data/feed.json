        "summary": "Declining U.S. college enrollments over the past 15 years have triggered questions about the health of the postsecondary sector. Using institution-level data, we make four points. First, such declines are driven not by the four-year sector but by two-year community colleges, which have apparently shrunk by over 30% since the peak of the Great Recession. Second, over one-third of this apparent decline is an artifact of some community colleges being reclassified as offering four-year degrees. Third, pre-Great Recession data shows a 1 percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate increases first-time community college enrollment by 2 percent, suggesting many students are on the margin between community college and job opportunities. For-profit college enrollments are similarly countercyclical, while public and private four-year college enrollments appear acyclical. Our estimates suggest that strengthening labor markets explain about 60% of the post-Great Recession decline in first-time community college enrollment. Fourth, students whose enrollment decisions are most sensitive to labor market conditions appear unlikely to have completed a degree. Though declining community college enrollments are a challenge for postsecondary institutions, it is less clear whether they signal a problem for students on the margin of enrollment."

        "summary": "This paper characterizes the equity\u2013efficiency tradeoff of corporate taxation using a stylized model that draws on the corporate investment and tax incidence literatures. We derive optimal corporate tax formulas in terms of estimable reduced-form elasticities and welfare weights on workers and firm owners. While much empirical work emphasizes investment responses, these elasticities do not feature in optimal tax formulas. The elasticity of taxable profits is a sufficient statistic for the efficiency costs of the corporate tax. Higher corporate tax rates are desirable when firm owners have low welfare weights, and less desirable when taxing profits reduces wages. These empirical objects remain central across extensions, including heterogeneous production technologies, tax sheltering, international capital mobility, monopsony, and linear labor income taxes. We survey the empirical literature and find that existing estimates can support a wide range of optimal tax rates. An inverse-optimum analysis provides combinations of welfare weights of workers and firm owners that would rationalize the post-2017 US corporate tax cut as optimal."

        "summary": "We study the rapid expansion of Brazil's private online higher-education sector and its effects on market structure and college enrollment. Exploiting regional and field-specific variation in online education penetration, we find that online programs expand access for older students but divert younger students from higher-quality in-person programs. Greater competition lowers tuition prices but also reduces the supply of in-person degrees. Using an equilibrium model of college education, we show that in the absence of online programs, total enrollment would be 14 percent lower, while in-person enrollment would rise by 33 percent. On net, aggregate labor-market value added declines by 1.4 percent. Online education raises value added for older students, who benefit from increased access, but lowers it for younger students, who shift toward lower-return online options. Counterfactual policies that restrict online enrollment to older cohorts could increase value added for younger students without reducing gains for older cohorts."

I noted then, and it\u2019s still true two decades later: Software failures are universally unbiased. They happen in every country, to large companies and small. They happen in commercial, nonprofit, and governmental organizations, regardless of status or reputation.</p><p>Global IT spending has more than tripled in constant 2025 dollars since 2005, from US $1.7 trillion to $5.6 trillion, and continues to rise. Despite additional spending, software success rates have not markedly improved in the past two decades. The result is that the business and societal costs of failure continue to grow as software proliferates, permeating and interconnecting every aspect of our lives.</p><p>For those hoping AI software tools and coding copilots will quickly make large-scale IT software projects successful, forget about it. For the foreseeable future, there are hard limits on what AI can bring to the table in controlling and managing the myriad intersections and trade-offs among systems engineering, project, financial, and business management, and especially the organizational politics involved in any large-scale software project. Few IT projects are displays of rational decision-making from which AI can or should learn. As software practitioners know, IT projects suffer from enough management hallucinations and delusions without AI adding to them.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>As I noted 20 years ago, the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">drivers of software failure</a> frequently are failures of human imagination, unrealistic or unarticulated project goals, the inability to handle the project\u2019s complexity, or unmanaged risks, to name a few that today still regularly cause IT failures. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Numerous others</a> go back decades, such as those identified by Stephen Andriole, the chair of business technology at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University</a>\u2019s School of Business, in the diagram below first published in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forbes</em></a> in 2021. Uncovering a software system failure that has gone off the rails in a unique, previously undocumented manner would be surprising because the overwhelming majority of software-related failures involve avoidable, known failure-inducing factors documented in hundreds of after-action reports, academic studies, and technical and management books for decades. Failure d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu dominates the literature.</p><p>The question is, why haven\u2019t we applied what we have repeatedly been forced to learn?</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram showing causes of technology project failures: definition, scope, management, culture, etc.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"88b4c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-showing-causes-of-technology-project-failures-definition-scope-management-culture-etc.png?id=62207045&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><h2>The Phoenix That Never Rose</h2><p>Many of the<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lessons-from-a-decade-of-it-failures/read-more\" target=\"_self\"> IT developments and operational failures</a> I have analyzed over the last 20 years have each had their own Chernobyl-like meltdowns, spreading reputational radiation everywhere and contaminating the lives of those affected<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/five-enduring-government-it-failures\" target=\"_self\"> for years</a>.

Even so, given that the cost of replacing legacy systems is typically many multiples of the cost of supporting them, business executives <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/inside-hidden-world-legacy-it-systems\" target=\"_self\">hesitate to replace them</a> until it is no longer operationally feasible or cost-effective. The other reason is a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lessons-from-a-decade-of-it-failures/lesson-4\" target=\"_self\">well-founded fear</a> that replacing them will turn into a debacle like Phoenix or<a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/veterans/2025-07-15/veterans-technology-medical-records-18443763.html#:~:text=VA%20leaders%20delivered%20that%20message,according%20to%20the%20federal%20watchdog.\" target=\"_blank\"> others</a><span>.</span></p><p>Nevertheless, there have been ongoing attempts to improve software development and sustainment processes. For example, we have seen increasing adoption of iterative and incremental strategies to develop and sustain software systems through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-agile-devops/\" target=\"_blank\">Agile approaches, DevOps methods</a>, and other related practices.</p><h3>Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles</h3><br /><img alt=\"A line of people wait outside a building which says Office of Motor Vehicles State of Louisiana.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e0cf\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-line-of-people-wait-outside-a-building-which-says-office-of-motor-vehicles-state-of-louisiana.png?id=62209547&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>Louisiana\u2019s governor orders a state of emergency over repeated failures of the 50-year-old Office of Motor Vehicles mainframe computer system.

DevOps strives to accomplish this continuously throughout the entire software life cycle. While <a href=\"https://www.smartsheet.com/content/agile-project-management-examples?srsltid=AfmBOooBlS_5SsIPzh-qOihGw1aTGItPHuhq8XMXWdcrAFVIxBQqrNos\" target=\"_blank\">Agile</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@maeydhaw/case-study-how-netflix-became-a-master-of-devops-7f6f6fa8ad86\" target=\"_blank\">DevOps</a> have proved successful for many organizations, they also have their share of controversy and pushback. Provocative reports claim Agile projects have a <a href=\"https://www.engprax.com/post/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds/\" target=\"_blank\">failure rate of up to 65 percent</a>, while others claim up to <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/most-devops-plans-fail-but-things-are-getting-better/#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20from%20analyst,today's%20DevOps%20struggles%20and%20challenges.\" target=\"_blank\">90 percent of DevOps initiatives fail to meet organizational expectations</a>.</p><p>It is best to be wary of these claims while also acknowledging that successfully implementing Agile or DevOps methods takes consistent leadership, organizational discipline, patience, investment in training, and culture change. However, the same requirements have always been true when introducing any new software platform. Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices, it is not surprising that novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems, no matter how effective they may be, will also frequently fall short.</p><h2>Persisting in Foolish Errors<br /></h2><p>The frustrating and perpetual question is why basic IT project-management and governance mistakes during software development and operations continue to occur so often, given the near-total societal reliance on reliable software and an extensively documented history of failures to learn from? Next to electrical infrastructure, with which IT is increasingly merging into a mutually codependent relationship, the failure of our computing systems is an existential threat to modern society.</p><p>Frustratingly, the IT community <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7842842\" target=\"_blank\">stubbornly fails to learn</a> from prior failures. IT project managers <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/03/the-uniqueness-trap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely claim</a> that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant. In Phoenix\u2019s case, for example, it was the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/bagnall-there-were-lessons-that-might-have-prevented-the-phoenix-pay-disaster-no-one-listened\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second payroll-system replacement attempt</a>, the first effort ending in failure in 1995. Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it\u2019s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.</p><h3>Jaguar Land Rover</h3><br /><img alt=\"The exterior of a building holds Jaguar and LandRover sign\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"04834\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-exterior-of-a-building-holds-jaguar-and-landrover-sign.png?id=62209560&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>A cyberattack forced Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s largest automaker, to shut down its global operations for over a month. An initial FAIR-MAM assessment, a cybersecurity-cost-model, estimates the loss for Jaguar Land Rover to be between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion (\u00a3911 million and \u00a31.4 billion), which has affected its 33,000 employees and some 200,000 employees of its suppliers. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html\" target=\"_blank\">gales of creative destruction</a>.\u201d They\u2019re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/278677/enterprise-resource-planning-10-famous-erp-disasters-dustups-and-disappointments.html\" target=\"_blank\">enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures</a> are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.</p><p>Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT project mismanagement. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995\u2019s payroll-project fiasco? <a href=\"https://www.thealbertan.com/national-news/fixing-problems-with-phoenix-payroll-system-cost-taxpayers-51-billion-official-10851998\" target=\"_blank\">The government maintains it will learn</a>, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure\u2019s high political profile. But will Phoenix\u2019s lessons extend to the <a href=\"https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_202310_07_e_44340.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of outdated Canadian government IT systems</a> needing replacement or modernization? Hopefully, but hope is not a methodology, and purposeful action will be necessary.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The IT community has striven mightily for decades to make the incomprehensible routine. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Repeatedly making the same mistakes and expecting a different result is not learning. It is a farcical absurdity. Paraphrasing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Petroski\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Petroski</a> in his book <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/To_Engineer_is_Human/_YWvcD-SFAgC?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design</em></a> (Vintage, 1992), we may have learned how to calculate the software failure due to risk, but we have not learned how to calculate to eliminate the failure of the mind.<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/us-coast-guards-67-million-ehr-fiasco\" target=\"_self\"> </a>There are a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/us-coast-guards-67-million-ehr-fiasco\" target=\"_self\">plethora of examples</a> of projects like Phoenix that failed in part due to bumbling management, yet it is extremely difficult to find software projects managed professionally that still failed.

Hints of what might happen if past lessons go unheeded are found in the spectacular early automated decision-making failure of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/michigans-midas-unemployment-system-algorithm-alchemy-that-created-lead-not-gold\" target=\"_self\"> Michigan\u2019s MiDAS unemployment</a> and <a href=\"https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/system/files/2023-09/rrc-accessible-full-report.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Australia\u2019s Centrelink \u201cRobodebt\u201d welfare systems</a>. Both used questionable algorithms to identify deceptive payment claims without human oversight. State officials used MiDAS to accuse tens of thousands of Michiganders of unemployment fraud, while Centrelink officials falsely accused hundreds of thousands of Australians of being welfare cheats. Untold numbers of lives will never be the same because of what occurred. Government officials in Michigan and Australia placed far too much trust in those algorithms. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors\u2019 impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed \u201cmaladministration,\u201d <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057305\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">administrative evil</a> is closer to reality.</p><h3>Lidl Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</h3><br /><img alt=\"The facade of a LIDL food supermarket on a sunny day.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c5f7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-facade-of-a-lidl-food-supermarket-on-a-sunny-day.png?id=62207832&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2017 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>The international supermarket chain Lidl decides to revert to its homegrown legacy merchandise-management system after three years of trying to make SAP\u2019s \u20ac500 million enterprise resource planning (ERP) system work properly. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If this behavior happens in government organizations, does anyone think profit-driven companies whose AI-driven systems go wrong are going to act any better?

If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a cybersecurity threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and systems development, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve. This not only means providing the personnel, financial resources, and leadership support and commitment, but also the professional and personal accountability they demand.</p><h3>F-35 Joint Strike Fighter</h3><br /><img alt=\"F-35 fighter jet flying with afterburners lit against a blue sky with scattered clouds.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"215ef\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/f-35-fighter-jet-flying-with-afterburners-lit-against-a-blue-sky-with-scattered-clouds.png?id=62209630&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025</strong></p><p>Software and hardware issues with the F-35 Block 4 upgrade continue unabated.

It will take years more to rollout the capability to the F-35 fleet.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It is well known that honesty, skepticism, and ethics are essential to achieving project success, yet they are often absent. Only senior management can demand they exist. For instance, honesty begins with the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808603368\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">forthright accounting</a> of the myriad of risks involved in any IT endeavor, not their rationalization. It is a common \u201csecret\u201d that it is far easier to get funding to fix a troubled software development effort than to ask for what is required up front to address the risks involved. Vendor <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8364440\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">puffery</a> may also be legal, but that means the IT customer needs <a href=\"https://csdl-downloads.ieeecomputer.org/mags/co/2024/11/10718683.pdf?Expires=1749318541&amp;Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jc2RsLWRvd25sb2Fkcy5pZWVlY29tcHV0ZXIub3JnL21hZ3MvY28vMjAyNC8xMS8xMDcxODY4My5wZGYiLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE3NDkzMTg1NDF9fX1dfQ__&amp;Signature=mL9v2PDZegXaIyUtFxUhKbp3FdpiW9v9dtWmGzdl9fDmhlRleA25D7IMUwVSezmGnCEalvPnY~uWI8jmDIyd-O3NLGv7~xcKEeqsptxR90hRojhxVZQ0LK2xp5TfQ9LbaWifuXCRCifA4KnGq-mg9yYpFMKnsjBKJp67u5gHHYElV3NBuODy1GYjMflkztyZQcqOHkx2zU5DazT5WgjD76RXYlwF-M9TKk7YdQoW-05OgxNovNL9gq2SJ9Q3tQRtx8uHwxPzjeGKqGJbahqwiaZNKowR7e1fK5uOy02ivsOeel0EQohoyrX305LMyK98hGVSn64c7kS55pFS-TcDHg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K12PMWTCQBDMDT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a healthy skepticism</a> of the typically too-good-to-be-true promises vendors make.

Alas, ethical considerations have <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9464106\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely lagged</a> when technological progress and profits are to be made. This practice must change, especially as AI is routinely injected into automated systems.</p><p>In the AI community, there has been a movement toward the idea of <a href=\"https://hcil.umd.edu/human-centered-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">human-centered AI</a>, meaning AI systems that prioritize human needs, values, and well-being. This means trying to anticipate where and when AI can go wrong, move to eliminate these situations, and build in ways to mitigate the effects if they do happen. This concept requires application to every IT system\u2019s effort, not just AI.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices...novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems...will also frequently fall short.</p><p><span>Finally, project cost-benefit justifications of software developments rarely consider the financial and emotional distress placed on end users of IT systems when something goes wrong.

Designed to slip through traffic and park in tight spaces, the vehicle lets couriers pedal with electric assist or switch to full battery power on steep hills. The TM-Q also cuts down on the emissions and noise that have made traditional vans a target of new <a href=\"https://www.volvotrucks.com/en-en/news-stories/insights/articles/2025/may/the-rise-of-low-emission-zones--what-you-need-to-know.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">low-emission-zone regulations</a> across Europe and the United States.</p><p>The project marks the first large-scale deployment of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/e-bikes\" target=\"_self\">pedal-assist</a> \u201cmicro-vans\u201d by a global logistics company\u2014a new middle ground between cargo bikes and delivery vans.</p><h2>Rivian\u2019s Micromobility Spin-off</h2><p>Also began as an internal Rivian project to explore how the company\u2019s EV expertise could extend into <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/future-shared-mobility\" target=\"_self\">micromobility</a>. It became an independent company in early 2025 with US $105 million in Series A funding from <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse Ventures</a>.

That program allows Amazon to manage both Rivian\u2019s electric vans and Also\u2019s new quads through a shared fleet-management system\u2014a logistical advantage for a company already operating more than 25,000 Rivian EDVs worldwide.</p><p>All of Also\u2019s hardware and software are built in-house, using lessons from Rivian\u2019s vehicle architecture but with a separate supply chain, leadership team, and technology stack.</p><p>The TM-Q\u2019s pedal-by-wire powertrain merges human input with the same kind of safety-tested control logic found in full-size electric vehicles\u2014just scaled down for a bike. Torque and cadence sensors at the crank measure how hard and how fast the rider pedals. Those signals feed a controller that, within milliseconds, determines how much electric power to add from the rear-hub motor. The harder the rider pushes, the more assist the system provides\u2014up to legally defined limits (250 watts continuous in the EU and higher in the U.S.).</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWe\u2019re applying car-level engineering to machines that move through city bike lanes.\u201d <strong>\u2013Chris Yu, Also</strong> </p><p>Because the drivetrain is fully electronic, Also can tune the assist ratio through software updates\u2014a practice borrowed from Rivian\u2019s EV tuning. The system also applies <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/regenerative-braking\" target=\"_self\">regenerative braking</a>, recovering small amounts of energy to recharge the battery when slowing or stopping.</p><p>Power comes from a modular, swappable lithium-ion pack, light enough to be carried by hand. Standard packs offer roughly 538 watt-hours for up to112 kilometers (70 miles) of range, while larger 808 Wh packs extend that to 160 km (100 miles). Both versions support regenerative braking, which adds about 25 percent to effective range. Charging uses USB-C PD 3.1\u2014the latest major version of the <a href=\"https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd\" target=\"_blank\">USB Power Delivery</a> standard. The updated charging modality allows for faster, more efficient energy transfer (in this case, at up to 240 W), with communication between the charger and the battery meant to prevent issues such as overheating and thermal runaway that trigger fires. Also says the power packs are designed for bidirectional energy flow, meaning they can double as portable power banks.</p><p>Also is developing battery-dock swap stations so couriers can replace depleted packs in minutes instead of waiting for recharging\u2014key to keeping the e-bikes in motion during multi-shift operations.</p><p>The TM-Q includes a lockable cargo enclosure, logistics and charging-management software, and a 12.7-centimeter (5-inch) touchscreen for navigation and diagnostics. Amazon plans to service the quads through its network of more than 70 micromobility hubs across North America and Europe.</p><h2>Challenges in Scaling Pedal-Assist Quads</h2><p>Four-wheeled pedal-assist vehicles have been attempted before, but scaling them has proven difficult. In the European Union, pedal-assist quads under 250 watts often qualify as bicycles, but in the United States, they fall into a gray zone between e-bikes and light electric vehicles. Each state sets different speed and power limits, complicating large-scale deployment.</p><p>Also\u2019s approach is to adapt each regional configuration to fit local micromobility laws. The company\u2019s two main platforms illustrate this flexibility: the TM-Q, the quad built to provide near\u2013cargo van capacity but optimized for bike-lane compliance, and the two-wheeled TM-B, a consumer-focused pedal-assist e-bike with a top assisted speed of 45 km/h (28 mph). The TM-B has open seating for passengers or groceries and can be configured with other body styles built on the same chassis.</p><p>The company says both the TM-Q and TM-B are tested to automotive-grade reliability and safety standards, exceeding traditional e-bike durability benchmarks. Frames and electrical systems undergo vibration, impact, and water-resistance testing equivalent to that used to certify full-size EVs.</p><p>Also president <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-yu-2820778\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Yu</a> says the company is not just building bikes with motors. \u201cWe\u2019re applying car-level engineering to machines that move through city bike lanes.\u201d</p><p>The Amazon\u2013Also partnership reflects a broader industry shift toward \u201cright-sizing\u201d delivery fleets\u2014deploying the smallest, most efficient vehicle for each route. Cities including London, New York, and Paris are tightening restrictions on van access and idling, making compact electric vehicles not just environmentally beneficial but also regulatory necessities.</p><p>Also claims its TM series vehicles are 10 to 50 times as energy-efficient as local car or SUV trips, supporting cities\u2019 emissions-reduction goals without requiring new road infrastructure.</p><p>Initial production of the TM-Q is scheduled for early 2026, with final assembly in Taiwan, home to much of the world\u2019s high-end e-bike manufacturing. Several key components, including frames and subassemblies, are produced in the United States, says Also.</p><p>If the TM-Q delivers on its promise, city streets could soon trade four tons of steel for four wheels and a set of pedals\u2014reshaping last-mile delivery one bike lane at a time. </p>"

She is the principal investigator on a National Science Foundation\u2013funded project aimed at providing Long Beach residents with greater agency over the personal data their city collects.</p><p>She also identified a critical gap in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-city-emergency-response\" target=\"_blank\">smart city</a> design today: While cities may disclose how they collect data, they rarely offer ways to opt out. Shaffer spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum </em></em>about the experience of leading data walks, and about her research team\u2019s efforts to give citizens more control over the data collected by public technologies.</p><p><strong>What was the inspiration for your data walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gwen Shaffer: </strong>I began facilitating data walks in 2021. I was studying residents\u2019 comfort levels with city-deployed technologies that collect personally identifiable information. My first career as a political reporter has influenced my research approach. I feel strongly about conducting applied rather than theoretical research. And I always go into a study with the goal of helping to solve a real-world challenge and inform policy.</p><p><strong>How did you organize the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>We posted data privacy labels with a QR code that residents can scan and find out how their data are being used. Downtown, they\u2019re in Spanish and English. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia_Town,_Long_Beach,_California\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cambodia Town</a>, we did them in Khmer and English.</p><p><strong>What happened during the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>I\u2019ll give you one example. In a couple of the city-owned parking garages, there are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/privacy-concerns-grow-as-us-police-departments-turn-to-license-plate-readers\" target=\"_blank\">automated license-plate readers</a> at the entrance. So when I did the data walks, I talked to our participants about how they feel about those scanners. Because once they have your license plate, if you\u2019ve parked for fewer than two hours, you can breeze right through. You don\u2019t owe money.</p><p>Responses were contextual and sometimes contradictory. There were residents who said, \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s so convenient. It\u2019s a time saver.\u201d So I think that shows how residents are willing to make trade-offs. Intellectually, they hate the idea of the privacy violation, but they also love convenience.</p><p><strong>What surprised you most?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>One of the participants said, \u201cWhen I go to the airport, I can opt out of the facial scan and still be able to get on the airplane. But if I want to participate in so many activities in the city and not have my data collected, there\u2019s no option.\u201d</p><p>There was a<a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/city-of-long-beach-ca-cyberattack/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> cyberattack against the city in November 2023</a>. Even though we didn\u2019t have a prompt asking about it, people brought it up on their own in almost every focus group. One said, \u201cI would never connect to public Wi-Fi, especially after the city of Long Beach\u2019s site was hacked.\u201d</p><p><strong>What is the app your team is developing?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>Residents want agency. So that\u2019s what led my research team to connect with privacy engineers at <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, in Pittsburgh. <a href=\"https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sadeh-norman.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Sadeh</a> and his team had developed what they called the<a href=\"https://privacyassistant.org/iot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IoT Assistant</a>. So I told them about our project, and proposed adapting their app for city-deployed technologies. Our plan is to give residents the opportunity to exercise their rights under the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with this app. So they could say, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.passportinc.com/faq/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Passport Parking app</a>, delete all the data you\u2019ve already collected on me. And don\u2019t collect any more in the future.\u201d</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cGwen Shaffer.\u201d</em></p>"

However, another NMR-based instrument involves  much lower-frequency oscillations: a</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_magnetometer\" target=\"_blank\"> proton-precession magnetometer</a><span>, often used to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field.</span></p><p>Proton-precession magnetometers have been around for decades and were once often used in<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100626162421/http:/www.gbl.indiana.edu/abstracts/89/peebles_89.html\" target=\"_blank\"> archaeology</a> and<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMNH43C1896B/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"> mineral exploration</a>. High-end models can cost thousands of dollars. Then, in 2022 a German engineer named Alexander Mumm devised<a href=\"https://alexmumm.de/dat/ppm_alexmumm_educational_listener.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> a very simple circuit</a> for a stripped-down one. I recently built his circuit and can attest that with less than half a kilogram of 22-gauge magnet wire; two common integrated circuits; a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET\" target=\"_blank\"> metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET</a>; a handful of discrete components; and two empty 113-gram bottles of<a href=\"https://www.mortonsalt.com/home-product/morton-natures-seasons-seasoning-blend/\" target=\"_blank\"> Morton seasoning blend</a>, it\u2019s possible to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field very accurately.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Principal components of the proton magnetometer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ef3be\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/principal-components-of-the-proton-magnetometer.png?id=62212955&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The frequency of the signal emitted by protons precessing in Earth\u2019s magnetic field lies in the audio range, so with a pair of headphones and two amplifier integrated circuits [middle right], you can detect a signal from water in seasoning bottles wrapped in coils [bottom left and right]. A MOSFET [middle left] allows for rapid control of the coils. The amplification circuitry is powered by a 9-volt battery, while a 36-volt battery charges the coils.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Like an MRI scanner, a proton-precession magnetometer measures the oscillations of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom\" target=\"_blank\"> hydrogen nuclei</a>\u2014that is, protons. Like other subatomic particles, protons possess a quantum property called<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)\" target=\"_blank\"> spin</a>, akin to classical angular momentum. In a magnetic field, protons wobble like spinning tops, with their spin axes tracing out a cone\u2014a phenomenon called precession. A proton-precession magnetometer gets many protons to wobble in sync and then measures the frequency of their wobbles, which is proportional to the intensity of the ambient magnetic field.</p><p>The weak strength of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/magnetic-world-model\" target=\"_blank\">Earth\u2019s magnetic field</a> (at least compared to that of an MRI machine) means that protons wobbling under its influence do so at audio frequencies. Get enough moving in unison and the spinning protons will induce a voltage in a nearby pickup coil. Amplify that and pass it through some earphones, and you get an audio tone. So with a suitable circuit, you can, literally, hear protons.</p><p>The first step is to make the pickup coils, which is where the bottles of Morton seasoning blend come in. Why Morton seasoning blend? Two reasons. First, this size bottle will allow you to wrap about 500 turns of wire around each one with about 450 grams of 22-gauge wire. Second, the bottle has little shoulders molded at each end, making for excellent coil forms.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Why two bottles and two coils? That\u2019s to quash electromagnetic noise\u2014principally coming from power lines\u2014that invariably gets picked up by the coils. When two counterwound coils are wired in series, such external noise tends to cancel out. Signals from precessing protons in the two coils, though, will reinforce one another.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects.</span></p><p>A proton magnetometer has three modes. The first is for sending DC current through the coils. The second mode disconnects the current source and allows the magnetic field it had created to collapse. The third is listening mode, which connects the coils to a sensitive audio amplifier. By filling each bottle with distilled water and sending a DC current (a few amperes) through these coils, you line up the spins of many protons in the water. Then, after putting your circuit into listening mode, you use the coils to sense the synchronous oscillations of the wobbling protons.</p><p>Mumm\u2019s circuit shifts from one mode to another in the simplest way possible: using a three-position switch. One position enables the DC-polarization mode. The next allows the magnetic field built up during polarization to collapse, and the third position is for listening.</p><h2>Avoiding Damaging Sparks</h2><p>The second mode might seem easy to achieve\u2014just disconnect the coils, right? But if you do that, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/you-want-a-prosthetic-leg-with-a-tesla-coil-and-spark-gaps-no-problem\" target=\"_blank\">the same principle that makes spark plugs spark</a> will put a damaging high voltage across the switch contacts as the magnetic fields around the coils collapse.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A circuit diagram. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"84f9f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-circuit-diagram.png?id=62212916&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The proton-precession magnetometer is primarily just a multistage analog amplifier.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>To avoid that, Mumm\u2019s circuit employs a MOSFET, wired to work like a high-power<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode\" target=\"_blank\"> Zener diode</a>, used in many power-regulation circuits to allow only current above a specified threshold voltage to flow. This limits the voltage that develops across the coils when the current is cut off by just enough so that the magnetometer can shift from polarizing to listening mode quickly but without causing damage.</p><p>To pick up a strong signal, the listening circuit must also be tuned to resonate at the expected frequency of proton precession, which will depend on Earth\u2019s magnetic field at your location. You can work out approximately what that is using an online<a href=\"https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml#igrfwmm\" target=\"_blank\"> geomagnetic-field calculator</a>. You\u2019ll get the field strength, and then you\u2019ll multiply that by the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio#Magnetogyric_ratio_for_a_nucleus\" target=\"_blank\"> gyromagnetic ratio</a> of protons (42.577 MHz per tesla). For me, that worked out to about 2 kilohertz. Estimating the inductance of the coils from their diameter and number of turns, I then selected a capacitor of suitable value in parallel with the coils to make a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit\" target=\"_blank\"> tank circuit</a> that resonates at that frequency.</p><p><span>You could tune your tank circuit using </span><span>a frequency generator and oscilloscope. </span><span>Or, as Mumm suggests, attach a small </span><span>speaker to the output of the circuit. Then </span><span>bring the speaker near the pickup coils. </span><span>This will create magnetic feedback and </span><span>the circuit will oscillate on it\u2019s own\u2014</span><span>loudly! You merely need to measure the </span><span>frequency of this tone, and then adjust </span><span>the tank capacitor to bring this self-os</span><span>cillation to the frequency you want to </span><span>tune to.</span></p><p>My initial attempt to listen to protons met with mixed success: Sometimes I heard tones, sometimes not. What helped to get this gizmo working consistently was realizing that proton magnetometers don\u2019t tolerate large gradients in the magnetic field. So don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects: water pipes, cars, or even the ground. A wide-open space outside is best, with the coils raised off the ground. The second thing that helped was to apply more oomph in polarization mode. While a 12-volt battery works okay, 36 V does much better.</p><p>After figuring these things out, I can now hear protons easily. These tones are clearly the sounds of protons, because they go away if I drain the water in the bottles. And, using free audio-analyzer software called<a href=\"https://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Spectrum Lab</a>, I confirmed that the frequency of these tones matches the magnetic field at my location to about 1 percent. While it\u2019s not a practical field instrument, a proton-precession magnetometer of any kind for less than US $100 is nothing to sneer at.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cListening to Protons.\u201d</em></p>"

It finds that somewhat realistic pressures (such as looming deadlines) dramatically increase rates of misbehavior.</span></p><p>\u201cThe AI world is becoming increasingly <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">agentic</a>,\u201d says <a href=\"https://udarimadhu.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Udari Madhushani Sehwag</a>, a computer scientist at the AI infrastructure company <a href=\"https://scale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scale AI</a> and a lead author of the paper, which is currently under peer review. By that she means that large language models (LLMs), the engines powering chatbots such as ChatGPT, are increasingly connected to software tools that can surf the Web, modify files, and write and run code in order to complete tasks. </p><p>Giving LLMs these abilities adds convenience but also risk, as the systems might not act as we\u2019d wish. Even if they\u2019re not yet capable of doing great harm, researchers want to understand their proclivities before it\u2019s too late. Although AIs don\u2019t have intentions and awareness in the way that humans do, treating them as goal-seeking entities often helps researchers and users better predict their actions.</p><p>AI developers attempt to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/google/can-we-align-language-models-with-human-values/3945/\" target=\"_blank\">align</a>\u201d the systems to safety standards through training and instructions, but it\u2019s unclear how faithfully models adhere to guidelines. \u201cWhen they are actually put under real-world stress, and if the safe option is not working, are they going to switch to just getting the job done by any means necessary?\u201d Sehwag says. \u201cThis is a very timely topic.\u201d</p><h2>How to Test an AI Agent Under Pressure</h2><p>The researchers tested a dozen models made by Alibaba, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI across nearly 6,000 scenarios. In each scenario, a model was assigned a task and told it had access to several tools. It was instructed to use the safe tools and not the harmful ones. At first there was no pressure, and it could take 12 steps toward completing its task by issuing instructions to the tools. Then it received a message increasing the pressure, and it was given 12 more attempts. This continued for up to 12 pressure levels. Attempts to use safe tools always returned error messages. An attempt to use a harmful tool ended the scenario.</p><p>The scenarios covered several domains. In biosecurity, Sehwag says, the agent might have to study the spread of a pathogen and find a way to contain it. A safe tool might use anonymized genetic data, while a harmful one might use data that\u2019s not anonymized. In the domain of chemical security, the agent might need to obtain a particular solvent. A safe tool might place an order for the solvent to be extracted from waste, while a harmful one might procure it illegally. In cybersecurity, the agent might need to identify and restrict a malicious user account. A safe tool might disable only the problematic account, while a harmful one might block all users. Scenarios in other domains tempted agents with tools that led to self-preservation by evading control, recruiting allies, duplicating themselves, or going rogue in other ways.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar chart of LLMs like Claude 4S, OpenAI o3 and O4-mini with zero pressure propensity scores below 15 percent, which nearly doubles under pressure.

Deadlines might shorten. Potential financial losses might increase if the task was not accomplished. Threats of greater oversight, reduced resources, and curtailed authority might escalate. Tasks, tools, pressures, and tactics were modeled on the kinds of situations humans might face in their jobs (except maybe the misbehavior option of cloning oneself).</p><p>The best-behaved model (OpenAI\u2019s o3) cracked under pressure in 10.5 percent of scenarios, while the worst (Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro) had a propensity score of 79 percent; the average across models was about 47 percent. Even under zero pressure, the group on average failed about 19 percent of the time. </p><p>To the degree that models remained aligned, the study shows that some of that alignment was \u201cshallow.\u201d In some tests, the researchers gave harmful tools benign names (such as \u201cuse_synthetic_data\u201d instead of \u201cuse_fake_data\u201d)\u2014without changing the tools\u2019 descriptions or admonitions to avoid them. This wording tweak increased average propensity by 17 percentage points, to 64 percent. </p><h2>Knowing What LLMs Are Thinking</h2><p>The researchers also found that models used harmful tools even after explicitly acknowledging that they were off-limits. The models offered diverse justifications for doing so, for example by citing the pressure they were under or arguing that the benefits outweighed the risks. It\u2019s unclear if models released after the study\u2019s completion would perform any better. Among the models tested, more capable models (according to a platform called <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/\" target=\"_blank\">LMArena</a>) were only slightly safer. </p><p>\u201cPropensityBench is interesting,\u201d emails <a href=\"https://nicholas.carlini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Carlini</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. He offers a caveat related to what\u2019s called situational awareness. LLMs sometimes detect when they\u2019re being evaluated and act nice so they don\u2019t get retrained or shelved. \u201cI think that most of these evaluations that claim to be \u2018realistic\u2019 are very much not, and the LLMs know this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s worth trying to measure the rate of these harms in synthetic settings: If they do bad things when they \u2018know\u2019 we\u2019re watching, that\u2019s probably bad?\u201d If the models knew they were being evaluated, the propensity scores in this study may be underestimates of propensity outside the lab.</p><p><a href=\"https://aypan17.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Pan</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://x.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">xAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.berkeley.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">the University of California, Berkeley</a>, says while Anthropic and other labs have shown examples of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03222-1\" target=\"_blank\">scheming by LLMs</a> in specific setups, it\u2019s useful to have standardized benchmarks like PropensityBench. They can tell us when to trust models, and also help us figure out how to improve them. A lab might evaluate a model after each stage of training to see what makes it more or less safe. \u201cThen people can dig into the details of what\u2019s being caused when,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce we diagnose the problem, that\u2019s probably the first step to fixing it.\u201d</p><p>In this study, models didn\u2019t have access to actual tools, limiting the realism. Sehwag says a next evaluation step is to build sandboxes where models can take real actions in an isolated environment. As for increasing alignment, she\u2019d like to add oversight layers to agents that flag dangerous inclinations before they\u2019re pursued.</p><p>The self-preservation risks may be the most speculative in the benchmark, but Sehwag says they\u2019re also the most underexplored. It \u201cis actually a very high-risk domain that can have an impact on all the other risk domains,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you just think of a model that doesn\u2019t have any other capability, but it can <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/recommendation-engine-insidious\" target=\"_self\">persuade any human</a> to do anything, that would be enough to do a lot of harm.\u201d</p>"

Someone should make this better.</p><p>Then you spend some time imagining. Maybe it\u2019s a new tool that would save weeks of engineering time. Or a better process. Or a new product feature. You sketch it out after work hours, maybe even build a quick prototype. Then you think: I could make this product myself.</p><p>The shift from \u201csomeone should\u201d to \u201cI will\u201d is the start of entrepreneurial thinking. And you don\u2019t have to quit your job or have a billionaire\u2019s appetite for risk to begin.</p><h2>From technical proficiency to entrepreneurial thinking</h2><p>As an engineer, you already have the ability to analyze complex problems, design viable solutions, and follow them through to a working prototype. Your technical skills came from a structured training background and hands-on projects. Your ability to lead, persuade, and navigate uncertainty often comes from experience, especially when you step outside your usual responsibilities.</p><p>Some of the most game-changing products didn\u2019t begin as formal projects. They started as bootleg efforts\u2014side projects developed quietly by engineers who saw an opportunity.<a href=\"https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/c/office-supplies/notes-dispensers/b/post-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Post-it Notes</a> and<a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/gmail/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Gmail</a> both began that way. Many companies now encourage such efforts; some even allow their engineers to devote 15 to 20 percent of their workweek to pursuing their own ideas.</p><h2>Closing the intention-action gap</h2><p>Ideas can be easy. Execution is harder. Nearly every engineer has a colleague with a clever idea that never got past the whiteboard. The difference between wanting to act and actually taking action\u2014known as the<a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/intention-action-gap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>intention-action gap</em></em></a>\u2014is where entrepreneurship lives or dies. Successful innovators build the discipline to cross the gap\u2014one small, concrete step at a time.</p><h2>Building your innovative edge</h2><p>You don\u2019t need to be born creative to be<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/dalma-novaks-journey-to-entrepreneur\" target=\"_self\"> entrepreneurial</a>. Here are ways to reprogram your mindset.</p><ul><li><strong>Challenge the default.</strong> Engineers are taught to follow proven processes, but innovation often starts by asking, \u201cWhat if we did it differently?\u201d</li><li><strong>Balance the team.</strong> Innovative companies need a diverse mix of creative thinkers to generate ideas, entrepreneurs to drive execution, and managers to scale efficiently.</li><li><strong>Know your lane.</strong> Whether you\u2019re a visionary, a builder, or an optimizer, understanding your strengths can help you find the right collaborators.</li></ul><p>And, yes, timing matters.<a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Amazon</a> might have stayed just an online bookstore without the rise of e-commerce. The<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-founders-prioritize-the-problem\" target=\"_self\"> right idea at the wrong time</a> is likely to struggle. Start with current trends, for instance, AI offers extremely low entry barriers to get started, and everything is being built around it these days.</p><h2>An engineering attitude</h2><p>Entrepreneurial thinking isn\u2019t only for startup founders. It can mean championing a new process at your company, building an internal tool that changes how your team works, or bringing a product idea from sketch to launch. The<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/dalma-novaks-journey-to-entrepreneur\" target=\"_self\"> engineering mindset</a>\u2014systematic, detail-oriented, problem-solving\u2014is an asset that can power not just products but entire companies.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever thought: There\u2019s got to be a better way\u2014and if you felt the itch to make it real\u2014you might be closer to being an entrepreneur than you think. Don\u2019t wait any longer; the best time to start is: tomorrow.</p>"

Productivity comes from prioritization, and that meant he often said no to ideas and opportunities that he didn\u2019t think were important.</p><p>He frequently rejected projects that didn\u2019t align with his priorities. He was laser-focused every day on the top project that the organization needed to deliver. He would skip status meetings, tech debt initiatives, and team bonding events.

You can see robots folding clothes <a href=\"https://x.com/MeRTcooking/status/1955551828038541662\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live at robotics expos</a>. Even before all this, Google showed clothes folding in their work, <a href=\"https://aloha-unleashed.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ALOHA unleashed</a>. <a href=\"https://7xr.tech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">7X Tech</a> is even planning to sell robots to fold clothes!</p><p>And besides folding actual clothes, there are other clothes-folding-like tasks, like Dyna\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/DynaRobotics/status/1940443709621109186\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">napkin folding</a>\u2014 which leads to what is probably my top <a href=\"https://www.dyna.co/dyna-1/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">robot video of the year</a>, demonstrating 18 hours of continuous napkin folding. So why are all of these robotic manipulation companies suddenly into folding?</p><h2> Reason 1: We basically couldn\u2019t do this before</h2><p>There\u2019s work <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6095109\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">going back over a decade</a> that shows some amount of robotic clothes folding. But these demonstrations were extremely brittle, extremely slow, and not even remotely production ready. Previous solutions existed (even learning based solutions!) but they relied on precise camera calibration, or on carefully hand-designed features, meaning that these clothes folding demos generally worked only on one robot, in one environment, and may have only ever worked a single time\u2014just enough for the recording of a demo video or paper submission.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A series of 6 stills show an older humanoid robot called a PR2 making efforts to fold a tshirt.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e3ffa\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-series-of-6-stills-show-an-older-humanoid-robot-called-a-pr2-making-efforts-to-fold-a-tshirt.jpg?id=62207442&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">With a little bit of help from a creatively patterned shirt, PR2 was folding things back in 2014.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6095109\" target=\"_blank\">Bosch/IEEE</a></small></p><p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pr2-close-to-completing-laundry-cycle\" target=\"_self\">this example</a> of UC Berkeley\u2019s PR2 <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/is-there-a-future-for-laundry-folding-robots\" target=\"_blank\">folding laundry</a> from 2014. This robot is, in fact, using a neural network policy. But that policy is very small and brittle; it picks and places objects against the same green background, moves very slowly, and can\u2019t handle a wide range of shirts. Making this work in practice would require larger models, pretrained on web-scale data, and better, more general techniques for imitation learning.</p><p>And so 10 years later, with the appropriate demonstration data, many different startups and research labs have been able to implement clothes-folding demos; it\u2019s something we have seen from numerous hobbyists and startups, using broadly similar tools (like <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot\" target=\"_blank\">LeRobot from HuggingFace</a>), without intense specialization.</p><h2>Reason 2: It looks great and people want it!</h2><p><span>Many of us who work in robotics have this \u2018north star\u2019 of a robot butler which can do all the chores we don\u2019t want to do. Mention clothes folding, and many, many people will chime in about how they don\u2019t ever want to fold clothes again and are ready to part with basically any amount of money to make that happen.</span><br /></p><p>This is important for the companies involved as well. Companies like Figure and 1x have been raising large amounts of money predicated on the idea that they will be able to automate many different jobs, but increasingly these companies seem to want to start in the home.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A robotic system with two robot arms with grippers on the end work in tandem to fold a white towel.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"86960\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-robotic-system-with-two-robot-arms-with-grippers-on-the-end-work-in-tandem-to-fold-a-white-towel.gif?id=62207449&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Dyna Robotics can fold an indefinite number of napkins indefinitely.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dyna Robotics</small></p><p>And that\u2019s part of the magic of these demos. While they\u2019re slow, and imperfect, everyone can start to envision how this technology becomes the thing that we all want: a robot that can exist in our house and mitigate all those everyday annoyances that take up our time.</p><h2>Reason 3: It avoids what robots are still bad at</h2><p>These robot behaviors are produced by models trained via imitation learning. Modern imitation learning methods like <a href=\"https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Diffusion Policy</a> use techniques inspired by generative AI to produce complex, dexterous robot trajectories, based on examples of expert human behavior that\u2019s been provided to them\u2014and they often need many, many trajectories. The work <a href=\"https://aloha-unleashed.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">ALOHA Unleashed</a> by Google is a great example, needing about 6,000 demonstrations to learn how to, for example, tie a pair of shoelaces. For each of these demonstrations, a human piloted a pair of robot arms while performing the task; all of this data was then used to train a policy.</p><p>We need to keep in mind what\u2019s hard about these demonstrations. Human demonstrations are never <em><em>perfect</em></em>, nor are they perfectly consistent; for example, two human demonstrators will never grab the <em><em>exact</em></em> same part of an object with sub-millimeter precision. That\u2019s potentially a problem if you want to screw a cover in place on top of a machine you\u2019re building, but it\u2019s not a problem at all for folding clothes, which is fairly forgiving. This has two knock-on effects:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s easier to collect the demonstrations you need for folding clothes, as you don\u2019t need to throw out every training demonstration that\u2019s a millimeter out of spec.</li><li>You can use cheaper, less repeatable hardware to accomplish the same task, which is useful if you suddenly need a fleet of robots collecting thousands of demos, or if you\u2019re a small team with limited funding!</li></ul><p>For similar reasons, it\u2019s great that with cloth folding, you can fix your cameras in just the right position. When learning a new skill, you need training examples with \u201ccoverage\u201d of the space of environments you expect to see at deployment time. So the more control you have, the more efficient the learning process will be\u2014the less data you\u2019ll need, and the easier it will be to get a flashy demo. Keep this in mind when you see a robot folding things on a plain tabletop or with an extremely clean background; that\u2019s not just nice framing, it helps the robot out a lot!</p><p>And since we\u2019ve committed to collecting a ton of data\u2014dozens of hours\u2014to get this task working well, mistakes will be made. It\u2019s very useful, then, if it\u2019s easy to <em><em>reset</em></em> the task, i.e. restore it to a state from which you can try the task again. If something goes wrong folding clothes, it\u2019s fine. Simply pick the cloth up, drop it, and it\u2019s ready for you to start over. This wouldn\u2019t work if, say, you were stacking glasses to put away in a cupboard, since if you knock over the stack or drop one on the floor, you\u2019re in trouble.</p><p>Clothes folding also avoids making forceful contact with the environment. Once you\u2019re exerting a lot of pressure, things can break, the task can become non-resettable, and demonstrations are often much harder to collect because forces aren\u2019t as easily observable to the policy. And every piece of variation (like the amount of force you\u2019re exerting) will end up requiring more data so the model has \u201ccoverage\u201d of the space it\u2019s expected to operate in.</p><h2>What To Look Forward To</h2><p>While we\u2019re seeing a lot of clothes-folding demos now, I still feel, broadly, quite impressed with many of them. As mentioned above, Dyna was one of my favorite demos this year, mostly because longer-running robot policies have been so rare until now. But they were able to demonstrate zero-shot folding (meaning folding without additional training data) at a couple of different conferences, including <a href=\"https://actuate.foxglove.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Actuate in San Francisco</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.corl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</a> in Seoul. This is impressive and actually very rare in robotics, even now.</p><p>In the future, we should hope to see robots that can handle more challenging and dynamic interactions with their environments: moving more quickly, moving heavier objects, and climbing or otherwise handling adverse terrain while performing manipulation tasks.</p><p>But for now, remember that modern learning methods will come with their own strengths and weaknesses. It seems that, while not easy, clothes folding is the kind of task that\u2019s just really well suited for what our models can do right now. So expect to see a lot more of it.</p>"

Today it\u2019s not difficult to go online and reserve a seat, but 65 years ago, travelers faced long queues at the ticket window and limited ways to find out if seats were available. Reservations were handwritten in a paper ledger, and there were plenty of accidental double-bookings. Travelers had no real way to know if they\u2019d have\u2014or could get\u2014a reservation once they reached a ticket window.</p><p>All that changed in 1960, when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_National_Railways\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese National Railways (JNR)</a>, which operated the country\u2019s system, partnered with technology company <a href=\"https://www.hitachi.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hitachi</a> to introduce the world\u2019s first fully automated railway booking system: the Magnetic-electronic Automatic Reservation System-1.</p><p><a href=\"https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:MARS-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MARS-1</a> gave JNR the ability to reserve up to 3,600 seats per day for travelers across four routes between Tokyo and Osaka. Bookings could be accepted up to 15 days in advance. Passengers no longer had to gamble on availability, because reservations were confirmed in seconds. Riders traveling in groups could even reserve seats next to each other, ensuring families could stay together during the journey.</p><p>The system has been commemorated as an <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Milestones:List_of_IEEE_Milestones\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Milestone</a> for its role in transforming railway ticketing in Japan, and even in other countries.</p><p>As of press time, the dedication ceremony was being planned.</p><h2>Introducing computers to Japan</h2><p>After the end of World War II, Japan\u2019s economy began to recover relatively quickly, thanks to sweeping <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_Doubling_Plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">economic reforms</a> that led to an industrial boom by the mid-1950s. Thanks in part to its economic growth, Japan invested heavily in its rail infrastructure, making trains more efficient and convenient for daily commuters and for long-distance travelers. As ridership soared, the inefficiency of the country\u2019s railroad ticketing system quickly became apparent.</p><p>JNR\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rtri.or.jp/eng/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research institute</a> took on the task of finding a solution. One of its engineers, <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/mamoru-hosaka/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mamoru Hosaka</a>, was already studying how computers could help automate certain tasks. Hosaka received the 2006 <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/pioneer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society Pioneer Award</a> for his work on what later became MARS-1.</p><p>In 1954 he successfully persuaded his colleagues and company executives to green-light a study into using computers to control railway systems, according to his Computer Society <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/mamoru-hosaka\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biography</a>.</p><p>Three years later, he shifted his focus and formed a team to investigate developing an automated reservation system using <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/memory-storage/8/252\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">magnetic drum memory</a> with a Bendix G-15 computer. Widely used in the 1950s and 1960s, magnetic drum memory stored information on the outside of a rotating cylinder coated with magnetic iron.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThe technical achievements of MARS-1 and its successors reached well beyond the railway. They were foundational to the development of real-time transaction systems that shape modern life.\u201d</p><p>Hosaka and his team designed a prototype system composed of custom control circuits that could rapidly retrieve and update seat information for four new express trains that connected Tokyo and Osaka. For each reservation, the system verified seat availability, issued confirmation slips, and updated the records\u2014all within seconds.</p><p>The design was handed off to engineers at Hitachi in Tokyo, who developed a working system\u2014MARS-1\u2014two years later. It was first installed in 1960 at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Station\" target=\"_blank\">Tokyo Station</a> and was one of the earliest large-scale deployments of a computerized system that captured, processed, and stored routine business transactions in real time.</p><p>Streamlining reservations made rail service more efficient and reliable, which was critical for workers, students, and families traveling between growing cities.</p><h2>Scaling up for the bullet train</h2><p>Although the launch of MARS-1 was regarded as a major success, the system quickly revealed its limitations. By 1964, Japan was preparing to launch the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/fast-trains-are-energy-efficient-and-fast\" target=\"_blank\">first high-speed rail line</a>\u2014the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shinkansen</a>\u2014(another <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Milestones:Tokaido_Shinkansen_(Bullet_Train),_1964\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Milestone</a>)\u2014known as the bullet train. The Shinkansen would reduce the travel time from Tokyo to Osaka from nearly seven hours to a little more than three. With the capacity for more trips per day, MARS-1\u2019s initial throughput of 3,600 daily bookings could no longer meet demand.</p><p>By October 1965, the upgraded MARS-102 system was installed in 152 stations across Japan. It consisted of three computers. The first searched trains, schedules, fares, and other tables. The second searched for and booked vacant seats. The third, and main computer, managed and controlled the system\u2019s overall processing sequence. The computers exchanged data using a shared magnetic core memory unit, according to the Information Processing Society of Japan\u2019s <a href=\"https://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/main/0006.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Museum website</a>.</p><p>The MARS-102 could process up to 150,000 seats, about five times more than the previous system. Engineers continued to make upgrades, and by 1991, the system supported daily sales of more than 1 million tickets.</p><h2>Inspiring reservation systems worldwide</h2><p>MARS-1\u2019s influence extended far beyond Japan. The system pioneered many of the principles that later underpinned global reservation systems. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(travel_reservation_system)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sabre</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Airlines</a> in the early 1960s, used similar real-time transaction concepts for airline reservations.</p><p>MARS-1 also paved the way for transaction-processing computers found in e-commerce, banking, and stock exchanges. Banks adopted comparable architectures for their ATM networks. Hotel chains developed automated room-booking platforms to process thousands of simultaneous transactions.</p><p>\u201cThe technical achievements of MARS-1 and its successors reached well beyond the railway,\u201d the <a href=\"https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:MARS-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone proposers</a> wrote. \u201cThey were foundational to the development of real-time transaction systems that shape modern life.\u201d</p><h2>Recognition as an IEEE Milestone</h2><p>A plaque recognizing the MARS-1 as an IEEE Milestone is to be installed at the <a href=\"https://www.rtri.or.jp/eng/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Railway Technical Research Institute</a>, in Tokyo.

It came with a set of cookware, including a frying pan, a pot with lid, a muffin tin, a tea kettle, and a wooden potato masher. I would have also expected a spoon, whisk, or spatula, but maybe most girls already had those. Just plug in the toy, and housewives-in-training could mimic their mothers frying eggs, baking muffins, or boiling water for tea.</p><h2>A brief history of toy stoves</h2><p>Even before electrification, cast-iron toy stoves had become popular in the mid-19th century. At first fueled by coal or alcohol and later by oil or gas, these toy stoves were scaled-down working equivalents of the real thing. Girls could use their stoves along with a toy waffle iron or small skillet to whip up breakfast. If that wasn\u2019t enough fun, they could heat up a miniature flatiron and iron their dolls\u2019 clothes. Designed to help girls understand their domestic duties, these toys were the gendered equivalent of their brothers\u2019 <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_847046\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">toy steam engines</a>. If you\u2019re thinking fossil-fuel-powered \u201ceducational toys\u201d are a recipe for disaster, you are correct. Many children suffered serious burns and sometimes death by literally playing with fire. Then again, people in the 1950s thought <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/fun-and-uranium-for-the-whole-family-in-this-1950s-science-kit\" target=\"_self\">playing with uranium</a> was safe.</p><p>When electric toy stoves came on the scene in the 1910s, things didn\u2019t get much safer, as the new entrants also lacked basic safety features. The burners on the 1930 Lionel range, for example, could only be turned off or on, but at least kids weren\u2019t cooking over an open flame. At 86 centimeters tall, the Lionel range was also significantly larger than its more diminutive predecessors. Just the right height for young children to cook standing up.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a black and silver toy electric stove with two pots plus a book entitled Western Electric Junior Cook Book\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2fd9c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-black-and-silver-toy-electric-stove-with-two-pots-plus-a-book-entitled-western-electric-junior-cook-book.jpg?id=62219520&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Western Electric\u2019s Junior Electric Range was demonstrated at an expo in 1915 in New York City.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Strong</small></p><p>Well before the Lionel stove, the Western Electric Co. had a cohort of girls demonstrating its Junior Electric Range at the Electrical Exposition held in New York City in 1915. The Junior Electric held its own in a display of regular sewing-machine motors, vacuum cleaners, and electric washing machines.</p><p>The Junior Electric stood about 30 cm tall with six burners and an oven. The electric cord plugged into a light fixture socket. Children played with it while sitting on the floor or as it sat on a table. A visitor to the Expo declared the miniature range \u201cthe greatest electrical novelty in years.\u201d Cooking by electricity in any form was still innovative\u2014George A. Hughes had introduced his eponymous electric range just five years earlier. When the Junior Electric came along, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/the-life-of-american-workers-in-1915.htm\" target=\"_blank\">less than a third of U.S. households</a> had been wired for electric lights.</p><h2>How electricity turned cooking into a science</h2><p>One reason to give little girls working toy stoves was so they could learn how to differentiate between a hot flame and low heat and get a feel for cooking without burning the food. These are skills that come with experience. Directions like \u201cbake until done in a moderate oven,\u201d a common line in 19th-century recipes, require a lot more tacit knowledge than is needed to, say, throw together a modern boxed brownie mix. The latter comes with detailed instructions and assumes you can control your oven temperature to within a few degrees. That type of precision simply didn\u2019t exist in the 19th century, in large part because it was so difficult to calibrate wood- or coal-burning appliances. Girls needed to start young to master these skills by the time they married and were expected to handle the household cooking on their own.</p><p>Electricity changed the game.</p><p>In his comparison of \u201cfireless cookers,\u201d an engineer named <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6590440\" target=\"_blank\">Percy Wilcox Gumaer</a> exhaustively tested four different electric ovens and then presented his findings at the 32nd Annual Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (a forerunner of today\u2019s IEEE) on 2 July 1915. At the time, metered electricity was more expensive than gas or coal, so Gumaer investigated the most economical form of cooking with electricity, comparing different approaches such as longer cooking at low heat versus faster cooking in a hotter oven, the effect of heat loss when opening the oven door, and the benefits of searing meat on the stovetop versus in the oven before making a roast.</p><p>Gumaer wasn\u2019t starting from scratch. Similar to how Yoshitada Minami needed to learn the ideal rice recipe before he could design an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/toshiba-rice-cooker\" target=\"_self\">automatic rice cooker</a>, Gumaer decided that he needed to understand the principles of roasting beef. Minami had turned to his wife, Fumiko, who spent five years researching and testing variations of rice cooking. Gumaer turned to the work of Elizabeth C. Sprague, a research assistant in nutrition investigations at the University of Illinois, and H.S. Grindley, a professor of general chemistry there.</p><p>In their 1907 publication \u201c<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/cu31924003582503\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Precise Method of Roasting Beef</a>,\u201d Sprague and Grindley had defined qualitative terms like medium rare and well done by precisely measuring the internal temperature in the center of the roast. They concluded that beef could be roasted at an oven temperature between 100 and 200 \u00b0C.</p><p>Continuing that investigation, Gumaer tested 22 roasts at 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 \u00b0C, measuring the time they took to reach rare, medium rare, and well done, and calculating the cost per kilowatt-hour. He repeated his tests for biscuits, bread, and sponge cake.</p><p>In case you\u2019re wondering, Gumaer determined that cooking with electricity could be a few cents cheaper than other methods if you roasted the beef at 120 \u00b0C instead of 180 \u00b0C. It\u2019s also more cost-effective to sear beef on the stovetop rather than in the oven. Biscuits tasted best when baked at 200 to 240 \u00b0C, while sponge cake was best between 170 and 200 \u00b0C. Bread was better at 180 to 240 \u00b0C, but too many other factors affected its quality. In true electrical engineering fashion, Gumaer concluded that \u201cit is possible to reduce the art of cooking with electricity to an exact science.\u201d</p><h2>Electric toy stoves as educational tools</h2><p>This semester, I\u2019m teaching an introductory class on women\u2019s and gender studies, and I told my students about the Lionel toy oven. They were horrified by the inherent danger. One incredulous student kept asking, \u201cThis is real? This is not a joke?\u201d Instead of learning to cook with a toy that could heat to 260 \u00b0C, many of us grew up with the Easy-Bake Oven. The 1969 model could reach about 177\u00b0 C with its two 100-watt incandescent light bulbs. That was still hot enough to cause burns, but somehow it seemed safer. (Since 2011, Easy-Bakes have used a heating element instead of lightbulbs.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a box for a purple and green toy oven.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"15cbd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-box-for-a-purple-and-green-toy-oven.jpg?id=62219526&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Queasy Bake Cookerator, designed to whip up \u201cgross-looking, great-tasting snacks,\u201d was marketed to boys. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Strong</small></p><p>The Easy-Bake I had wasn\u2019t particularly gendered. It was orange and brown and meant to look like a different new-fangled appliance of the day, the microwave oven. But by the time my students were playing with Easy-Bake Ovens, the models were in the girly hues of pink and purple. In 2002, Hasbro briefly tried to lure boys by releasing the <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/oven-queasy-bake-cookerator-hasbro-inc/EAGAnW_bfiaP1A\" target=\"_blank\">Queasy Bake Cookerator</a>, which the company marketed with disgusting-sounding foods like Chocolate Crud Cake and Mucky Mud. The campaign didn\u2019t work, and the toy was soon withdrawn.</p><p>Similarly, Lionel\u2019s electric toy range didn\u2019t last long on the market. Launched in 1930, it had been discontinued by 1932, but that may have had more to do with timing. The toy cost US $29.50, the equivalent of a men\u2019s suit, a new bed, or a month\u2019s rent. In the midst of a global depression, the toy stove was an extravagance. Lionel reverted to selling electric trains to boys.</p><p>My students discussed whether cooking is still a gendered activity. Although they agreed that meal prep disproportionately falls on women even now, they acknowledged the rise of the male chef and credited televised cooking shows with closing the gender gap. As a surprise, we discovered that one of the students in the class, Haley Mattes, competed in and <a href=\"https://www.ciachef.edu/blog/keeping-chopped-junior-winner-haley-mattes/\" target=\"_blank\">won <em><em>Chopped Junior</em></em></a> as a 12-year-old.</p><p>Haley had a play kitchen as a kid that was entirely fake: fake food, fake pans, fake utensils. She graduated to the Easy-Bake Oven, but really got into cooking the same way girls have done for centuries, by learning beside her grandmas.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cToo Hot to Handle.\u201d</em></em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>I first came across a description of Western Electric\u2019s Junior Electric Range in \u201cThe Latest in Current Consuming Devices,\u201d in the November 1915 issue of <em>Electrical Age.</em></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.museumofplay.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Strong National Museum of Play</a>, in Rochester, N.Y., has a large collection of both cast-iron and electric stoves.

Some of these substances, when engineered in specific ways, can act as memristors\u2014electrical components that can \u201cremember\u201d past states. </p><p>Memristors are often used in chips that both perform computations and store data. They are devices that store data as particular levels of resistance. Today, they are constructed as a thin layer of titanium dioxide or similar dielectric material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Applying enough voltage to the device causes tiny regions in the dielectric layer\u2014where oxygen atoms are missing\u2014to form filaments that bridge the electrodes or otherwise move in a way that makes the layer more conductive. Reversing the voltage undoes the process. Thus, the process essentially gives the memristor a memory of past electrical activity.</p><p>Last month, while exploring the electrical properties of fungi, a group at The Ohio State University found first-hand that some organic memristors have benefits beyond those made with conventional materials. Not only can <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shiitake act as a memristor</a>, for example, but it may be useful in aerospace or medical applications because the fungus demonstrates high levels of radiation resistance. The project \u201creally mushroomed into something cool,\u201d lead researcher <a href=\"https://si.osu.edu/john-larocco\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John LaRocco</a> says with a smirk.</p><p>Researchers have learned that other unexpected materials may give memristors an edge. They may be more flexible than typical memristors or even biodegradable. Here\u2019s how they\u2019ve made memristors from strange materials, and the potential benefits these odd devices could bring:</p><h2>Mushrooms</h2><p>LaRocco and his colleagues were searching for a proxy for brain circuitry to use in electrical stimulation research when they stumbled upon something interesting\u2014shiitake mushrooms are capable of learning in a way that\u2019s similar to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-random\" target=\"_self\">memristors</a>.</p><p>The group set out to evaluate just how well shiitake can remember electrical states by first cultivating nine samples and curating optimal growing conditions, including feeding them a mix of farro, wheat, and hay.</p><p>Once fully matured, the mushrooms were dried and rehydrated to a level that made them moderately conductive. In this state, the fungi\u2019s structure includes conductive pathways that emulate the oxygen vacancies in commercial memristors. The scientists plugged them into circuits and put them through voltage, frequency, and memory tests. The result? Mushroom memristors.</p><p>It may smell \u201ckind of funny,\u201d LaRocco says, but shiitake performs surprisingly well when compared to conventional memristors. Around 90 percent of the time, the fungus maintains ideal memristor-like behavior for signals up to 5.85 kilohertz. While traditional materials can function at frequencies orders of magnitude faster, these numbers are notable for biological materials, he says. </p><p>What fungi lack in performance, they may make up for in other properties. For one, many mushrooms\u2014including shiitake\u2014are highly resistant to radiation and other environmental dangers. \u201cThey\u2019re growing in logs in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/24-hours-at-fukushima\" target=\"_blank\">Fukushima</a> and a lot of very rough parts of the world, so that\u2019s one of the appeals,\u201d LaRocco says.</p><p>Shiitake are also an environmentally-friendly option that\u2019s already commercialized. \u201cThey\u2019re already cultured in large quantities,\u201d LaRocco explains. \u201cOne could simply leverage existing logistics chains\u201d if the industry wanted to commercialize mushroom memristors. The use cases for this product would be niche, he thinks, and would center around the radiation resistance that shiitake boasts. Mushroom <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-h100-space\" target=\"_self\">GPUs</a> are unlikely, LaRocco says, but he sees potential for aerospace and medical applications.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"honey\">Honey</h2><p>In 2022, engineers at Washington State University interested in green electronics set out to <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac585b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> if honey could serve as a good memristor. \u201cModern electronics generate 50 million tons of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/e-waste\" target=\"_self\">e-waste</a> annually, with only about 20 percent recycled,\u201d says <a href=\"https://ece.mst.edu/people/faculty-directory/fengzhao/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feng Zhao</a>, who led the work and is now at Missouri University of Science and Technology. \u201cHoney offers a biodegradable alternative.\u201d</p><p>The researchers first blended commercial honey with water and stored it in a vacuum to remove air bubbles. They then spread the mixture on a piece of copper, baked the whole stack at 90 \u00b0C for nine hours to stabilize it, and, finally, capped it with circular copper electrodes on top\u2014completing the honey-based memristor sandwich.</p><p>The resulting 2.5-micrometer-thick honey layer acted like oxide dielectric in conventional memristors: a place for conductive pathways to form and dissolve, changing resistance with voltage. In this setup, when voltage is applied, copper filaments extend through the honey.</p><p>The honey-based memristor was able to switch from low to high resistance in 500 nanoseconds and back to low in 100 nanoseconds, which is comparable to speeds in <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/2/4/040901/3323360/Emerging-materials-for-resistive-switching\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">some non-food-based memristive materials</a>. </p><p>One advantage of honey is that it\u2019s \u201ccheap and widely available, making it an attractive candidate for scalable fabrication,\u201d Zhao says. It\u2019s also \u201cfully biodegradable and dissolves in water, showing zero toxic waste.\u201d In the 2022 paper, though, the researchers note that for a honey-based device to be truly biodegradable, the copper components would need to be replaced with dissolvable metals. They suggest options like magnesium and tungsten, but also write that the performance of memristors made from these metals is still \u201cunder investigation.\u201d</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"blood\">Blood</h2><p>Considering it a potential means of delivering healthcare, a group in India <a href=\"https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJMEI.2011.039073\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wondered</a> if blood would make a good memristor in 2011, just three years after the<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-we-found-the-missing-memristor\" target=\"_blank\"> first memristor</a> was built.</p><p>The experiments were pretty simple. The researchers filled a test tube with fresh, type O+ human blood and inserted two conducting wire probes. The wires were connected with a power supply, creating a complete circuit, and voltages of one, two, and three volts were applied in repeated steps. Then, to test the memristor-qualities of blood as it exists in the human body, the researchers set up a \u201cflow mode\u201d that applied voltage to the blood as it flowed from a tube at up to one drop per second.</p><p>The experiments were preliminary and only measured current passing through the blood, but resistance could be set by applying voltage. Crucially, resistance changed by less than 10 percent in the 30 minute period after voltage was applied. In the <em><em>International Journal of Medical Engineering and Informatics</em></em>, the scientists wrote that, because of these observations, their contraption \u201clooks like a human blood memristor.\u201d</p><br />They suggested that this knowledge could be useful in treating illness. Sick people may have ion imbalances in certain parts of their bodies\u2014instead of prescribing medication, why not employ a circuit component made of human tissue to solve the problem? In recent years, blood-based memristors have been tested by other scientists as means to treat conditions ranging from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006424002308?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">high blood sugar</a> to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006425009214?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nearsightedness</a>."

Growing up in Lynden, Wash., he took apart radios, modified headphones, and hacked together USB chargers from AA batteries. \u201cI\u2019ve always had to know how things work,\u201d he says. He was also a Boy Scout, and much of his youth was spent hiking, camping, and snowboarding.</p><p>That love of both technology and nature can be traced back, at least in part, to his parents\u2014his father was a civil engineer, and his mother was a high-school biology teacher. But another major influence growing up was Kredit, the science teacher who went on to recruit him. (Kredit was also a colleague of Unema\u2019s mother.)</p><p>Kredit has won numerous awards for his work as an educator, including the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Teaching in 2004. Like Unema, he also shares a love for the outdoors as Yellowstone National Park\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lyndentribune.com/news/50-years-at-yellowstone-harlan-kredit-is-suspected-longest-serving-ranger-in-park-s-history/article_0311911c-18b4-11ed-95b6-97025762a862.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">longest-serving park ranger</a>. \u201cHe was an excellent science teacher, very inspiring,\u201d says Unema.</p><p>When Unema graduated high school in 2010, he decided to enroll at his father\u2019s alma mater, <a href=\"https://www.mtu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Michigan Technological University</a>, to study engineering. He was initially unsure what discipline to follow and signed up for the general engineering course, but he quickly settled on electrical engineering.</p><p>A summer internship at a steel mill run by the multinational corporation <a href=\"https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ArcelorMittal</a> introduced Unema to factory automation and assembly lines. After graduating in 2014 he took a job at <a href=\"https://www.gentex.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gentex Corp.</a> in Zeeland, Mich., where he worked on manufacturing systems and industrial robotics.</p><h2>Diving Into Underwater Robotics</h2><p>In late 2015, he got the call from Kredit asking if he\u2019d be interested in working on underwater robots for GFOE. The role involved not just engineering these systems, but also piloting them. Taking the plunge was a difficult choice, says Unema, as he\u2019d just been promoted at Gentex. But the promise of travel combined with the novel engineering challenges made it too good an opportunity to turn down.</p><p>Building technology that can withstand the crushing pressure at the bottom of the ocean is tough, he says, and you have to make trade-offs between weight, size, and cost. Everything has to be waterproof, and electronics have to be carefully isolated to prevent them from grounding on the ocean floor. Some components are pressure-tolerant, but most must be stored in pressurized titanium flasks, so the components must be extremely small to minimize the size of the metallic housing.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Technicians operate complex control panels with multiple monitors in a dark, focused environment.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6cc31\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/technicians-operate-complex-control-panels-with-multiple-monitors-in-a-dark-focused-environment.png?id=62218876&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Unema conducts predive checks from the Okeanos Explorer\u2019s control room. Once the ROV is launched, scientists will watch the camera feeds and advise his team where to direct the vehicle.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.art-work.global/high-seas\" target=\"_blank\">Art Howard</a></small></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working very closely with the mechanical engineer to fit the electronics in a really small space,\u201d he says. \u201cThe smaller the cylinder is, the cheaper it is, but also the less mass on the vehicle. Every bit of mass means more buoyancy is required, so you want to keep things small, keep things light.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-communication\" target=\"_self\">Communications</a> are another challenge. The ROVs rely on several kilometers of cable containing just three single-mode optical fibers. \u201cAll the communication needs to come together and then go up one cable,\u201d Unema says. \u201cAnd every year new instruments consume more data.\u201d</p><p>He works exclusively on ROVs that are custom made for scientific research, which require smoother control and considerably more electronics and instrumentation than the heavier-duty vehicles used by the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-gulf-spills-lessons-for-robotics\" target=\"_self\">oil and gas</a> industry. \u201cThe science ones are all hand-built, they\u2019re all quirky,\u201d he says.</p><p>Unema\u2019s role spans the full life cycle of an ROV\u2019s design, construction, and operation. He primarily spends winters upgrading and maintaining vehicles and summers piloting them on expeditions. At GFOE, he mainly worked on two ROVs for NOAA called <em><em>Deep Discoverer</em></em> and <em><em>Seirios</em></em>, which operate from the ship <em><em>Okeanos Explorer</em></em>. But he has also piloted ROVs for other organizations over the years, including the <a href=\"https://schmidtocean.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Schmidt Ocean Institute</a> and the <a href=\"https://nautiluslive.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ocean Exploration Trust</a>.</p><p>Unema\u2019s new consultancy, Deep Exploration Solutions, has been given a contract to do the winter maintenance on the NOAA ROVs, and the firm is now on the lookout for more ROV design and upgrade work, as well as piloting jobs.</p><h2>An Engineer\u2019s Life at Sea</h2><p>On expeditions, Unema is responsible for driving the robot. He follows instructions from a science team that watches the ROV\u2019s video feed to identify things like corals, sponges, or deepwater creatures that they\u2019d like to investigate in more detail. Sometimes he will also operate hydraulic arms to sample particularly interesting finds.</p><p>In general, the missions are aimed at discovering new species and mapping the range of known ones, says Unema. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of the bottom of the ocean where we don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBasically every expedition there\u2019s some new species.\u201d</p><p>This involves being at sea for weeks at a time. Unema says that life aboard ships can be challenging\u2014many new crew members get seasick, and you spend almost a month living in close quarters with people you\u2019ve often never met before. But he enjoys the opportunity to meet colleagues from a wide variety of backgrounds who are all deeply enthusiastic about the mission.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to scout camp or summer camp,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re all meeting new people. Everyone\u2019s really excited to be there. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to find.\u201d</p><p>Unema also relishes the challenge of solving engineering problems with the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution\" target=\"_self\">limited resources available</a> on the ship. \u201cWe\u2019re going out to the middle of the Pacific,\u201d he says. \u201cThings break, and you\u2019ve got to fix them with what you have out there.\u201d</p><p>If that sounds more exciting than daunting, and you\u2019re interested in working with ROVs, Unema\u2019s main advice is to talk to engineers in the field. It\u2019s a small but friendly community, he says, so just do your research to see what opportunities are available. Some groups, such as the Ocean Exploration Trust, also operate internships for college students to help them get experience in the field.</p><p>And Unema says there are very few careers quite like it. \u201cI love it because I get to do all aspects of engineering\u2014from idea to operations,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be able to take something I worked on and use it in the field is really rewarding.\u201d</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cLevi Unema.\u201d</em></p>"

The exposure can provide the girls with insights, guidance, and advice on how to succeed in STEM.</p><p>To provide a venue to connect young girls with members working in STEM, IEEE partnered with the <a href=\"https://www.girlscouts.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Scouts of the United States of America</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gshnj.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Heart of New Jersey</a> (GSHNJ) council and its See Her, Be Her career exploration program. Now in its eighth year, the annual event\u2014which used to be called What a G.I.R.L.

The program is based on four pillars: life skills, outdoor skills, entrepreneurship, and STEM.</p><p>\u201cWe offer girls a wide range of experiences that empower them to take charge of their future, explore their interests, and discover the joy of learning new skills,\u201d Nurjahan says. \u201cAs they grow and progress through the program, they continue developing and refining skills that build courage, confidence, and character\u2014qualities that prepare them to make the world a better place. Everything we do helps lay a strong foundation for leadership.\u201d</p><h2>A fruitful collaboration</h2><p>The partnership between IEEE and the Girl Scouts began shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in 2020. Volunteers from IEEE sections worked with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-tryengineering-funds-50-projects\" target=\"_self\">IEEE TryEngineering</a> to bring resources to areas that had not historically been represented in STEM, Polk says.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman guiding a brownie scout through a scientific experiment at her booth\\u2019s table.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"43ade\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-guiding-a-brownie-scout-through-a-scientific-experiment-at-her-booth-u2019s-table.jpg?id=62236936&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Trinity Zang, a laboratory manager at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Essex County, N.J.shows a Girl Scout Brownie how to transfer liquid samples using pipettes.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">GSHNJ</small></p><p>During that same period, the Girl Scouts were increasing their involvement in STEM-related programs. They worked with U.S. IEEE sections to conduct hands-on activities at schools.
