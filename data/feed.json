        "summary": "Is human-caused climate change likely to trigger enduring economic decline in modern societies? We study whether changes in violent conflict and economic growth caused by warming could interact to degrade economic opportunities and trap African countries in poverty. We provide evidence of an emerging high-conflict and low-growth \"poverty trap\" equilibrium in Africa and describe theoretically how such an equilibrium could result from warming. We then combine historical data on temperature, growth, and conflict with projections from a large ensemble of global climate models to evaluate the risk that warming and subsequent conflict could push African economies into a regime of sustained negative economic growth. We find that the risk of such \"economic collapse\" is material in a moderate-to-high emissions scenario. We estimate that in Africa, a current \"high\" emissions trajectory (RCP 7.0) may increase the incidence of conflict 5.1 percentage points (95% CI 0.2-13.0) and increase the share of countries with net negative GDP growth this century by 12.2 percentage points (95% CI 2.0-27.5).  We calculate that roughly 82% of this additional conflict risk and 14% of projected GDP losses are due to the interacting effects between these two outcomes, underscoring the importance of accounting for their indirect effects and feedbacks. Our findings suggest an unprecedented scale of emissions mitigation, economic policy innovation or institutional investment that would be required to contain the risk of catastrophic human impacts from climate change in many African countries."

        "summary": "Immunotherapy is a breakthrough innovation in cancer care but is also among the most expensive treatments, with costs exceeding $150,000 per patient. We study the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the most widely used class of immunotherapy drugs. In 2022, ICIs accounted for 44% of the $17.5 billion Medicare Part B cancer drug spending. We focus on metastatic melanoma, the first approved indication for ICIs. While overall cancer mortality rates declined since the 1990s, melanoma mortality rates increased through the early 2010s. Following the first ICI approvals in 2011 and 2014, melanoma mortality declined sharply. Using traditional Medicare claims, we estimate the impact of the introduction of ICIs on healthcare utilization, costs, and 1-year survival for patients with metastatic melanoma, relative to metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), where ICIs were not approved until 2017. Variation in approval timing allows us to isolate the effect of ICIs from broader cancer care trends. We find that ICIs reduced 1-year mortality by 6.2%. Since about 1 in 5 metastatic melanoma patients received ICIs, this implies a 27.5% reduction among treated patients. The introduction of ICIs also reduced chemotherapy and radiation use, but increased Medicare spending by 59.3% or about 260% among ICI-treated patients. Accounting for life expectancy gains beyond one year, the benefits of ICIs for melanoma patients appear comparable, or potentially even greater, than the substantial added Medicare costs. Nonetheless, ICI use remains relatively low given large survival benefits and few alternative treatments, suggesting that costs\nand other barriers limit patient access."

While the 2025 System of National Accounts introduces AI as a distinct asset, challenges remain in valuing AI-related investments, inputs, and outputs. Moreover, as a general-purpose technology, AI alters business processes, service quality, and labor organization in ways poorly reflected in official data. This paper outlines key measurement gaps from transformative AI, including the tracking cross-border inputs, quality change, and process changes. We argue that economic statistics should adopt more granular, task-based, and outcome-focused approaches to ensure relevance in an increasingly AI-driven economy."

I review evidence on how trade in LMICs is shaped by frictions in labor, capital, material, land, and information markets, and highlight areas where the evidence base remains thin. I concluded with a discussion of vertical policies relevant for LMICs\u2014particularly the role of services\u2014and suggest areas where further research is needed to assess whether development can be service-led."

We study the effect of fractional ownership on the licensing of copyrighted material and its reuse. To do so, we compile new data on the copyright ownership structure of songs and their licensing for use in movies. We document that fractional song ownership has increased substantially: the mean number of songwriters and publishers per song has tripled between 1958 and 2021. We show that, conditional on a rich set of controls, greater fractionalization is associated with lower likelihood of licensing. We leverage the Sony-led acquisition of EMI Music Publishing in 2012 to obtain within-song variation in ownership and find that consolidating ownership rights significantly increases licensing, beyond any standalone effects of the merger."

        "summary": "We explore the evolving significance of different production sectors within the U.S. economy since World War II and provide methods for estimating and forecasting these shifts. Using a compositional accounting approach, we find that the well-documented transition from goods to services is primarily driven by two compositional changes: 1) the rise of Intellectual Property Products (IPP) as an input producer, replacing Durable Goods almost one-for-one in terms of input shares in virtually all sectors; and 2) a shift in consumer spending from Nondurable Goods to Services. A structural model replicating these shifts reveals that the rise of IPP at the expense of Durable Goods is largely explained by increases in the efficiency of IPP inputs used in production: input-biased technical change. Trend variations in sectoral total factor productivity, and their attendant effects on relative prices and income, are the main driver of evolving consumption patterns. Both reduced-form and structural forecasts project these trends to continue over the next two decades, albeit at lower rates, indicating a slower pace of structural change."

Orbital collision warnings can be unremitting.

Each collision then creates more fragments, in a runaway cascade that turns low Earth orbit into a hazard zone.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>For satellite operators, sudden silences could be the first warning signs. Ground station crews that today coordinate elegant sequences of thruster burns will face more chaotic obstacle courses and bigger debris fields blooming across their display monitors. Communication lines and data traffic may drop from time to time, too, sowing chaos on the ground and menacing flights across the globe. And as the slow catastrophe builds, fuel reserves for satellite constellations will bleed down into the red from so many extensive orbital maneuvers. Spacecraft that\u2019ve run dry today will be the seedbed for tumbling, hypervelocity shrapnel tomorrow.</p><p>This doomsday scenario is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Kessler syndrome,</a> named after the American astrophysicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Kessler</a>, who <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19990041784/downloads/19990041784.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in 1976</a> began circulating his first notices at NASA about possible runaway orbital debris. Now, as the magnitude of the <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-space-junk-and-why-is-it-a-problem.html\" target=\"_blank\">space junk problem</a> rapidly scales up, technological responses are ramping up as well. Solutions in the offing include high-resolution orbital tracking, AI-powered constellation management, and an emerging robotic tech called \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/european-space-agency-esa-mission-news-orbital-debris-solar-storms\" target=\"_blank\">active debris removal</a>.\u201d This last item involves lofting a specialized spacecraft into orbit, armed with grippers or other satellite-wrangling tech that can target and grab orbiting stuff. The removal craft then guides the space junk through reentry and the ultimate splashdown of whatever survives reentry into the middle of the ocean.</p><p>But tech alone may not be enough for the magnitude of the task ahead. The debris problem could simply be growing too fast. International treaties and government regulations may be needed to classify orbits as <a href=\"https://www.wfw.com/articles/spectrum-rights-and-orbital-positions-what-do-space-operators-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">globally managed resources, like radio spectrum</a>. Because as Kessler himself has pointed out, space <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/027311779190543S\" target=\"_blank\">is complicated</a>\u2014sometimes <a href=\"https://newspaceeconomy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-kessler-syndrome-2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">frustratingly so</a>.</p><h2>What Is the Kessler Syndrome?</h2><p>In the early days, those frustrations were related to simply getting the space community to realize the problem that lay ahead. Back in the early 1970s, when <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vleo\" target=\"_blank\">low Earth orbit</a> was all but pristine, Kessler was a midcareer NASA scientist, having already notched important contributions to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab\" target=\"_blank\">Skylab</a> programs. As his colleague, the late NASA administrator <a href=\"https://aquarid.physics.uwo.ca/kessler/Burt%20Cour_Palais.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Burton Cour-Palais</a>, noted in a 2004 <a href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/Cour-PalaisBG/Cour-PalaisBG_3-1-04.htm\" target=\"_blank\">oral history</a>, Kessler \u201cwas bringing up this orbital debris thing, and the higher-ups did not want to know about it at all.\u201d</p><p>Cour-Palais also recalled being told to urge Kessler to \u201ccome up with solutions rather than problems.\u201d Fortunately, neither took the overly cautious route.</p><p>In June 1978, the <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21562202\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em></em></a><em> </em>published a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JA083iA06p02637\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> by Kessler and Cour-Palais in which they argued that a rapidly growing belt of defunct satellites, collision fragments, and other detritus could \u201cbe a significant problem during the next century.\u201d It\u2019s a prediction that has come to pass. In April of this year, Kessler and <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wzjd6/professor-hugh-lewis\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Lewis</a>, professor of astronautics at the <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Birmingham</a>, in England, presented their <a href=\"https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/sdc9/paper/305/SDC9-paper305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">latest models</a>, concluding that space junk orbiting between 400 and 1,000 kilometers\u2014where most low Earth satellites operate\u2014is already unstable. And between 520 and 1,000 km, the researchers found, debris concentrations are at or near levels that might sustain runaway growth.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25069014/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p>A recent internal report shared with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em><em>, </em></em>written by analysts at the Menlo Park, Calif.\u2013based <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, has divided the problem into what it calls \u201cfour waves of the Kessler syndrome.\u201d The first three waves, it says, may have already begun. They are: nontrackable stuff like tiny steel fragments and glass splinters colliding with non-operational trackable objects; nontrackable stuff impacting functioning satellites and causing malfunctions; and trackable objects hitting other trackable objects and creating a clouds of fragments. The fourth wave, in which two large pieces of debris incite a chain reaction of other collisions, has yet to occur. In LeoLabs\u2019 observations and models, satellites and operational spacecraft including the International Space Station, and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_space_station\" target=\"_blank\">Tiangong</a> space station continue to face manageable levels of collision avoidance maneuvers\u2014for now.</p><p>\u201cIt is assumed these operational satellites will avoid catastrophic collisions with trackable objects,\u201d the report concludes.</p><p>But according to <a href=\"https://www.swfsummit.org/luc-piguet\" target=\"_blank\">Luc Piguet</a>, CEO and cofounder of the Lausanne, Switzerland\u2013based startup <a href=\"https://clearspace.today/\" target=\"_blank\">ClearSpace</a>, challenges for operational satellites are real and mounting. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is a slow, crawling effect\u2014that when it starts accelerating, it\u2019s already too late,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is happening.\u201d</p><p>The problem can be further segmented into specific problematic orbits, according to <a href=\"https://aiaa.org/people/darren-mcknight/\" target=\"_blank\">Darren McKnight</a>, senior technical fellow at <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, which performs high-resolution debris tracking for private clients and government agencies.</p><p>\u201cThere are certain altitudes where we\u2019ve already passed the threshold for the Kessler syndrome,\u201d McKnight says. For instance, at 775 km altitude, as well as at 840 km and 975 km, the collision risk is scaling up rapidly. (See graph, \u201cLow Earth Orbit\u2019s Most High-Risk Places.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cWe will hit a point where particular popular orbits are so risky to operate in that the benefits of operating there are outweighed by the cost and risk,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.daniellerwood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danielle Wood</a>, head of <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Media Lab</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-enabled/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Space Enabled Research Group</a>.</p><h2>Why Is the Kessler Syndrome Complicated?</h2><p><a href=\"https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">According to the European Space Agency</a>, 14.5 million kilograms of man-made stuff circles the planet today. Compare that to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230930201159/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">11 million</a> kg two years ago and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200818221915/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">8.9 million</a> kg in 2020\u2014a 63 percent increase over the past five years.</p><p>McKnight says the Kessler problem comes into sharper focus when dividing mass in any given orbit by the volume of space that orbit occupies. The <em><em>mass density </em></em>in orbit, also known as the mass per cubic kilometer, provides a clue not only to the chance of orbital collisions but also to those collisions\u2019 consequences. Two small orbiting items colliding won\u2019t create nearly as much new debris as will two big ones. The more densely packed an orbit is, in other words, the more treacherous it is to keep a satellite at that orbit. \u201cMass per cubic kilometer is debris-generating potential,\u201d McKnight says, which would be a great thing to know with confidence in all the different regions of low Earth orbit.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Solar panel with three impact holes and visible damage on each section.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ff39b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/solar-panel-with-three-impact-holes-and-visible-damage-on-each-section.png?id=61618553&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 2002, Space Shuttle astronauts retrieved these solar panels from the Hubble Space Telescope\u2014revealing how destructive even small projectiles are when traveling at low Earth orbit speeds.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ESA </small></p><p>However, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kcourtneybis/\" target=\"_blank\">Katherine Courtney</a>, chair of the <a href=\"https://gnosisnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Network on Sustainability in Space</a>, knowing where all orbiting stuff is today has become a tall order. \u201cA substantial portion of smaller space junk can only be extrapolated using data collected from returned spacecraft and historical records. The vast majority can\u2019t be tracked from the ground,\u201d Courtney adds.</p><p>Moreover, says <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/jonathan-mcdowell\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan McDowell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mcdowell-19b0997/\" target=\"_blank\">astrophysicist and space historian</a> at the Harvard & Smithsonian <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Astrophysics</a>, in Cambridge, Mass., once stuff in orbit goes missing, further complications emerge. Collisions between the missing matter and other debris can completely knock the collisions\u2019 by-products into different orbits.</p><p>\u201cThe operating satellites are in nice circular orbits,\u201d McDowell says, \u201cwhereas the collision debris is crossing many orbits and affecting many more.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s now needed as the problem grows larger is a complete rethink, says <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/jah\" target=\"_blank\">Moriba Jah</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics</a> at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to the Kessler syndrome,\u201d Jah says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cascading collisions can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s that the framework oversimplifies the problem and doesn\u2019t give us a way to manage or evolve the system.\u201d</p><p>Consider instead, Jah says, a parameter he calls \u201corbital carrying capacity.\u201d \u201cIf we start from the end, we can say that carrying capacity is consumed when our ability to make decisions to avert harm no longer work,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo to me, that doesn\u2019t necessarily look like you\u2019re bumping into stuff. It also looks like you\u2019re spending fuel moving around stuff so much that you can\u2019t do the things that you wanted to do to begin with.\u201d</p><h2>How to Avoid Satellite Collisions</h2><p>As SpaceX proved 144,404 times from December 2024 through May of this year, the Starlink constellation\u2019s capacity to maneuver its hardware around space junk is impressive.</p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink</a> is a brilliant constellation,\u201d McKnight says. \u201cThey\u2019re like a granny driving on the highway. They pump their brakes. They avoid everything.\u201d</p><p>However, Starlink\u2019s own public record also showcases how rapidly the collision hazards in orbit are evolving. The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://universemagazine.com/en/starlink-satellites-performed-26-thousand-avoidance-maneuvers/\" target=\"_blank\">publicly disclosed data</a> reveals a 22-fold increase since 2020 in the amount of ducking and dodging the constellation has needed to perform to avoid collisions with other stuff in orbit.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s ducking and dodging these days, too.</p><p>\u201cCollision avoidance is a standard practice now for every operator,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Flohrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Flohrer</a>, head of the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris\" target=\"_blank\">Space Debris Office</a>.</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep your operations making sense, communicating with everybody else,\u201d says <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/person/marlon-sorge\" target=\"_blank\">Marlon Sorge</a>, technical fellow at the Chantilly, Va.\u2013based <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace Corp.</a>, \u201cand not making more of the stuff that you can\u2019t communicate with.\u201d</p><p>Yet, space junk isn\u2019t the only class of noncommunicative stuff up there. \u201cMore than half of the unidentified objects are Chinese satellites,\u201d says Courtney of the Global Network on Sustainability in Space. \u201cSo they\u2019re active satellites, but they\u2019re just not registered as identifiable objects.\u201d</p><p>The tracked debris, the untrackable tiny debris, the bigger things that are also incommunicado\u2014all of it combines to make for an increasingly massive headache.</p><p>\u201cEvery collision-avoidance maneuver is a nuisance,\u201d Holger Krag, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-krag-72895324/\" target=\"_blank\">head of ESA\u2019s Space Safety office</a>, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/AI-autonomous-space-debris-avoidance-esa\" target=\"_blank\">has said.</a> \u201cNot only because of fuel consumption but also because of the preparation that goes into it. We have to book ground-station passes, which costs money. Sometimes we even have to switch off the acquisition of scientific data. We have to have an expert team available round the clock.\u201d</p><p>So who or what, then, could possibly keep up with the rapidly scaling nature of the Kessler problem? Artificial intelligence is the almost unanimous answer.</p><p>Many of the world\u2019s major players in low Earth orbit, including <a href=\"https://content.neuraspace.com/product-launch\" target=\"_blank\">small satellite startups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation/Artificial_intelligence_in_space\" target=\"_blank\">big national space programs</a>, are currently testing and developing AI constellation-management systems.

And you\u2019re not allowed to touch someone else\u2019s stuff without their permission.\u201d</p><p>In August, Japan <a href=\"https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/japan-launches-international-rules-for-space-debris-removal/60484/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> it would be developing its own legal frameworks for removing space junk from orbit.

This compact, open-source model can handle massive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-context-window\" target=\"_blank\">context windows</a> of 250,000 tokens (meaning that it can \u201cremember\u201d and reason over much more text than typical language models) and can run at high speed, even on consumer devices. The launch highlights a growing shift: smaller, more efficient models could shape the future of AI just as much as raw scale. </p><p>\u201cWe believe in a more decentralized future for AI\u2014one where not everything runs in massive data centers,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ori-goshen/\" target=\"_blank\">Ori Goshen</a>, Co-CEO of AI21, in an interview with <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>. \u201cLarge models will still play a role, but small, powerful models running on devices will have a significant impact\u201d on both the future and the economics of AI, he says. Jamba is built for developers who want to create edge-AI applications and specialized systems that run efficiently on-device.</p><p>AI21\u2019s Jamba Reasoning 3B is designed to handle long sequences of text and challenging tasks like math, coding, and logical reasoning\u2014all while running with impressive speed on everyday devices like laptops and mobile phones. Jamba Reasoning 3B can also work in a hybrid setup: simple jobs are handled locally by the device, while heavier problems get sent to powerful cloud servers. According to AI21, this smarter routing could dramatically cut AI infrastructure costs for certain workloads\u2014potentially by an order of magnitude.</p><h2>A Small but Mighty LLM</h2><p>With 3 billion parameters, Jamba Reasoning 3B is tiny by today\u2019s AI standards. Models like GPT-5 or Claude run well past 100 billion parameters, and even smaller models, such as Llama 3 (8B) or Mistral (7B), are more than twice the size of AI21\u2019s model, Goshen notes.</p><p>That compact size makes it more remarkable that AI21\u2019s model can handle a context window of 250,000 tokens on consumer devices. <span>Some proprietary models, like GPT-5, offer even longer context windows, but Jamba sets a new high-water mark among open-source models. The previous open-model</span><span> record of 128,000 tokens </span><span>was held by </span><span>Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2 (3B), Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 Mini, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepseek\" target=\"_blank\">DeepSeek R1</a>, which are all much larger models. </span><span>Jamba Reasoning 3B can process more than 17 tokens per second even when working at full capacity</span><span>\u2014that is, with</span><span> extremely long inputs that use its full 250,000-token context window. Many other models slow down or struggle once their input length exceeds 100,000 tokens.</span></p><p>Goshen explains that the model is built on an architecture called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887\" target=\"_blank\">Jamba</a>, which combines two types of neural network designs: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a> layers, familiar from other large language models, and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mamba-model\" target=\"_blank\">Mamba</a> layers, which are designed to be more memory-efficient. This hybrid design enables the model to handle long documents, large codebases, and other extensive inputs directly on a laptop or phone\u2014using about one-tenth the memory of traditional transformers. Goshen says the model runs much faster than traditional transformers because it relies less on a memory component called the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249\" target=\"_blank\">KV cache</a>, which can slow down processing as inputs get longer. </p><h2>Why Small LLMs Are Needed</h2><p>The model\u2019s hybrid architecture gives it an advantage in both speed and memory efficiency, even with very long inputs, confirms a software engineer who works in the LLM industry. The engineer requested anonymity because they\u2019re not authorized to comment on other companies\u2019 models. <span>As more users run generative AI locally on laptops, models need to handle long context lengths quickly without consuming too much memory. At 3 billion parameters, Jamba meets these requirements, says the engineer, making it a model that\u2019s optimized for on-device use.</span></p><p>Jamba Reasoning 3B is open source under the permissive <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 license</a> and available on popular platforms such as <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugging Face</a> and <a href=\"https://lmstudio.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">LM Studio</a>. The release also comes with instructions for fine-tuning the model through an open-source reinforcement-learning platform (called <a href=\"https://github.com/volcengine/verl\" target=\"_blank\">VERL</a>), making it easier and more affordable for developers to adapt the model for their own tasks.</p><p>\u201cJamba Reasoning 3B marks the beginning of a family of small, efficient reasoning models,\u201d Goshen said. \u201cScaling down enables decentralization, personalization, and cost efficiency. Instead of relying on expensive GPUs in data centers, individuals and enterprises can run their own models on devices. That unlocks new economics and broader accessibility.\u201d</p>"

Then a pattern is made, the fabric is chosen and cut, and the garment is sewed. Finally the clothing is packaged and shipped.</p><p>To expedite the process, some apparel companies now use 3D technologies including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/augmented-reality-consumers-customize-products\" target=\"_self\">design software</a>, <a href=\"https://sagroups.ieee.org/ic15-004/home/ic-groups/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">body scans</a>, visualization, and 3D <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printing-smart-objects\" target=\"_self\">printers</a>. The tools allow designers to envision their creations in a variety of colors, fabrics, and motifs. Avatars known as <em><em>digital twins</em></em> are created to simulate how the clothes will look and fit on different body types.

Based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, the consultancy assists fashion and consumer goods companies with automating content, managing 3D digital assets, and improving workflows.</p><h2>Custom-made clothing by 3D and AI</h2><p>Ill-fitting garments, shoes, and accessories are problems for clothing companies. The average <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/media/clothing-return-rates-by-category-and-country-csf-a/#:~:text=Global%20Overview,in%20the%20region%20at%2022%2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">return rate worldwide for clothing ordered online is more than 25 percent</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PrimeAI</a>.</p><p>To make ready-to-wear clothing, designers use grading, a process that takes an initial sample pattern of a base size using established standards and 3D body scans, then makes smaller and larger versions to be mass-produced. But the resulting clothes do not fit everyone.</p><p>Returns, which can be frustrating for shoppers, are costly for clothing companies due to reshipping and restocking expenses.</p><p>Some customers can\u2019t be bothered to send back unwanted items, and they throw them in the garbage, where they end up in landfills.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we could go back to the days when you would go to a shop, get measured, and someone would custom-make your garment?\u201d posits <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-lavange-b0358a15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh LaVange</a>, an assistant professor of technical design and patternmaking at FIT.</p><p>That was the idea behind LaVange\u2019s winning project, Automated Custom Sizing. Her proposal uses 3D technology and AI to produce custom-tailored clothing on demand for all body types. She outlined short- and long-term scalable solutions in her submission.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d <strong>\u2014Leigh LaVange</strong></p><p>\u201cI see it [custom sizing] as a solution that can be automated and eventually rolled out across all different types of brands,\u201d she says.</p><p>The short-term proposal involves measuring a person\u2019s base body specifications, such as bust, waist, thighs, biceps, and hips\u2014either manually or from a 3D body scan. An avatar of the customer is then created and entered into a database preloaded with 3D representations of various sizes of the sample garment. The AI program notes the customer\u2019s specs and the existing sizes to determine the best fit. If, for example, the person\u2019s chest matches the medium-size dimensions but the hips are a few millimeters larger, the program still might recommend medium because it determined the material around the hips had enough excess fabric. A rendering of an avatar wearing an item is shown to customers to help them decide whether to make the purchase.</p><p>LaVange says her solution will help improve customer satisfaction and minimize returns.</p><p>Her long-term plan is a truly customized fit. Using 3D body scans, an AI program would determine the necessary adjustments to the pattern based on the customer\u2019s specifications and critical fit points, like the waist, while preserving the original design. The 3D system then would make alterations, which would be rendered on the customer\u2019s avatar for approval. The solution would eliminate excess inventory, LaVange says, because the clothing would be custom-made.</p><p>Because her proposals rely on technologies not currently used by the industry and a different way of interacting with customers, a shift in production would be required, she says.</p><p>\u201cMost manufacturing systems today are set up to produce as many units as possible in a single day,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a way to produce garments efficiently if you set up your manufacturing facility correctly. I want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d</p><h2>A digital asset management platform</h2><p>The winning submission in the startup category, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhl20Qr4Ss\" target=\"_blank\">AI-First DAM [digital asset management] as an Intelligent Backbone for Agile Product Development</a>, uses 3D technology and AI to combine components of clothing design into a centralized platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristian-sons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kristian Sons</a>, chief executive of Pixascale, launched the startup in February. He left <a href=\"https://www.adidas.com/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adidas</a> in January after nine years at the company, where he was the technical lead for digital creation.</p><p>Many apparel companies, Sons says, still store their 3D files on employees\u2019 local drives or on Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint</a>, a Web-based document-management system.</p><p>Those methods make things difficult because not everyone has access.</p><p>Sons\u2019 cloud-based platform addresses the issue by sharing digital assets, such as images, videos, 3D models, base styles, and documents, to all parties involved in the process.</p><p>That includes designers, seamstresses, and manufacturers. His system integrates with the client\u2019s file management system, providing access to the most recent images, renderings, and other relevant data.</p><p>His DAM system also includes a library of embellishments such as zippers and buttons, as well as fabric options.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and can understand what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration.\u201d <strong>\u2014Kristian Sons</strong></p><p>\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and track what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration,\u201d he says.</p><p>Sons also is working on incorporating <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-economy\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> and large language models to connect with internal systems and application programming interfaces to autonomously conduct simple research requests.</p><p>That might include suggesting new products or different silhouettes, or modifying the previous season\u2019s offerings with new colors, Sons says.</p><p>\u201cThese AI agents certainly will not be perfect, but they are a good starting point so designers don\u2019t have to start from scratch,\u201d he says. \u201cI think using AI agents is super exciting because in the past few years in the fashion industry, we have been talking about how AI would do the creative parts, like designing a product.

She has explored the role artificial intelligence plays in diagnosing and treating conditions including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alzheimers-disease\" target=\"_self\"> Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\"> </a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression\" target=\"_self\">depression</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\">, epilepsy</a>, and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/schizophrenia\" target=\"_self\"> schizophrenia</a>.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_self\">IEEE mentoring program</a>, she received guidance from global experts including a doctor from India who helped refine her early AI projects.</p><p>Her work quickly evolved from class assignments to projects with real-world potential.</p><p>\u201cThe project I\u2019m most excited about has not been published, but it mainly consisted of using convolutional neural networks in medical image processing (MRI) and machine learning in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases,\u201d she says.</p><p>This year she broadened her scope by attending the IEEE<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Conference on Robotics and Automation</a> in Atlanta, where she gained exposure to both industrial and academic applications of robotics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick. I want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Currently she is an intern at <a href=\"https://www.aunainvestors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Auna</a>, a health care network in Latin America. She contributes to improving the patient experience in hospitals across Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.</p><p>\u201cI design projects aimed at improving the quality of care and making the hospital intervention more effective for patients across different stages: prevention/wellness, diagnosis, hospitalization, rehabilitation, and post-discharge follow-up,\u201d She declined to provide specific examples, citing medical confidentiality agreements.</p><p>\u201cMy internship is about finding ways to make health care not just effective but also more humane,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about improving processes so patients feel cared for\u2014from the moment they enter the hospital until they leave.\u201d</p><h2>Finding leadership and purpose in IEEE</h2><p>Ramirez founded the IEEE EMBS student branch in 2023. As chair, she represents the branch at <a href=\"https://r9.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Region 9</a> meetings, where she advocates for mentorship opportunities and collaboration with other IEEE groups.</p><p>Through her involvement, she says, she has gained not only technical knowledge but also critical soft skills in leadership, time management, and teamwork.</p><p>\u201cIEEE taught me how to lead with empathy and how to work with people from different backgrounds,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has expanded my vision beyond Mexico, showing me challenges and innovations happening all over the world.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree abroad\u2014potentially in public health or AI for medical devices\u2014and ultimately a Ph.D. Her long-term goal is to launch a business focused on developing health care innovations, specifically in disease prevention.</p><h2>A future built on innovation</h2><p>For Ramirez, improving health care means more than developing cutting-edge technology. It also involves rethinking how people understand and manage their own health.</p><p>\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Her vision is as ambitious as it is personal, rooted in her own journey from Zacatecas to Monterrey and beyond.</p><p>As her career advances, she says, she intends to keep IEEE at the center of her professional life.</p><p>\u201cIn IEEE I\u2019ve found a community that challenges me to grow, supports me when I fail, and celebrates when I succeed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about engineering; it\u2019s about building a better future, together.\u201d</p>"

Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.<br /></p><p>Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July. Leathers uses his <span>28</span>-foot (8.5-meter) boat for cultivating oysters at <a href=\"https://maineoceanfarms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maine Ocean Farms</a>, where roughly <span>3</span> million of the animals grow in dozens of floating cages.</p><p>Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine\u2019s <span>3</span>,<span>500</span> miles (5,633 kilometers) of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor. For Leathers, whose <span>10</span>-acre (4-hectare) sea farm is a significant presence in the cove where he operates, the swap is about being a good neighbor to the shoreside community.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>It\u2019s an innovation born from necessity for us,\u201d said Strater about his electric boat, which he docks each night at the <a href=\"https://www.seameadow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sea Meadow Marine Foundation</a>, the nonprofit boatyard and aquaculture innovation hub he runs with several other small business owners. \u201c[The boat] really works well for what we do with it, and we\u2019re letting farmers use it to see how it could work for them.\u201d</p><h2>The Rise of Electric Boats</h2><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-boats\" target=\"_blank\">Battery-powered vessels</a> are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/the-first-all-electric-tugboat-in-the-us-is-about-to-launch\" target=\"_blank\">tugboats</a>, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.</p><p>In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world\u2019s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>Everyone\u2019s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we\u2019ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,\u201d said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. ferries</a>. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two men stand outside the cockpit of an electric boat named Heron that sits on the water.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e15a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-men-stand-outside-the-cockpit-of-an-electric-boat-named-heron-that-sits-on-the-water.jpg?id=61664831&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Maine Ocean Farms founders Eric Oransky [left] and Willy Leathers switched to an electric workboat in July 2025.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.bullockweddings.com/index/G0000YGZ6gDoqSck\" target=\"_blank\">Brendan Bullock</a></small></p><p><span>Electrification has only very recently come to the U.S. aquaculture sector. In Maine, the small but fast-growing segment includes nearly </span><a href=\"https://maineaqua.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>200</span> farms</a><span> for shellfish, fin fish, and edible seaweed. Strater and Leathers are among the first in their business to trade gas motors for electric propulsion\u2014a switch they say they\u2019re hoping to accelerate. Oil-guzzling motors are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar seafood sector.</span></p><p>Still, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-container-ships-are-stuck-on-the-horizon\" target=\"_blank\">electrifying commercial watercraft can be a difficult course to navigate</a>, given the higher up-front costs of electric motors and the lack of charging infrastructure\u2014and grid infrastructure in general\u2014in rural waterfront communities.</p><p>Early adopters like Strater and Leathers said they hope the experiences gained from their demonstrations can help pave the way for decarbonizing Maine\u2019s blue economy. With the help of the <a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Island Institute</a>, a Maine-based nonprofit that works on marine-related energy transitions, Leathers is collecting performance data from his vessel to share more broadly with the industry.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>People say it looks cool and shiny and looks like it operates great,\u201d Lia Morris, the Island Institute\u2019s senior community development officer, said of electric boats. <span>\u201c</span>But we really want to be able to prove out the [business] case.\u201d <span>Electric boats can cost between </span><span>20 percent</span><span> and </span><span>30 percent</span><span> more than a gas- or diesel-powered vessel of a comparable size. However, owners can save on maintenance and fuel over the long term, Strater\u2019s business partner Nick Planson said.</span><br /></p><p><span>\u201c</span>The high-level math that we\u2019ve come up with\u201d is a financial break-even point of <span>\u201c</span>about four to five years, and then over a <span>10</span>-year time span, you\u2019re definitely coming out way ahead based on the vastly reduced maintenance cost, replacement cost of failed equipment, and fuel costs,\u201d said Planson.</p><h2>Battery-Powered Workboats Lack Charging Infrastructure</h2><p>But the initial price tag presents a significant hurdle. Strater and Planson\u2019s sleekly designed, no-frills watercraft cost US $<span>100</span>,<span>000</span> to build and outfit with a single electric outboard motor. Leathers\u2019s boat, called Heron, cost about four times as much. It has two electric outboards and a ramp for unloading and hauling more than <span>10</span>,<span>000</span> oysters at a time from the sea farm to distributors waiting on the dock. Its hull is also equipped with a small cabin and toilet.</p><p>Both operations relied on grant funding to defray the expense of going electric.</p><p>For their part, Strater and Planson used about $<span>50</span>,<span>000</span> from a larger U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/1031783-an-electric-workboat-for-the-aquaculture-industry.html\" target=\"_blank\">small business grant</a> they got in <span>2024</span> to establish a use case for electric workboats in the aquaculture industry. Leathers\u2019s business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $<span>500</span>,<span>000</span> U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) <a href=\"https://www.aquaculturenorthamerica.com/maine-ocean-farms-adopts-electric-workboats-for-oyster-farming/#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20able%20to%20bring%20this,of%20Energy%2C%20Office%20of%20Energy%20Efficiency%20and\" target=\"_blank\">grant</a> last year that earmarked about $<span>289</span>,<span>000</span> for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.</p><p>The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.</p><p>The <span>DOE</span>\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it\u2019s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d says Strater.</p><p>But federal grants aren\u2019t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises, Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a <span>\u201c</span>marine green\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ceimaine.org/financing/small-business-loans/#marine-green-loans\" target=\"_blank\">loan program</a> that can make the up-front costs of switching to electric propulsion more accessible to small businesses.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,\u201d said Nick Branchina, director of <span>CEI</span>\u2019s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, <span>CEI</span> offers loans starting at $<span>25</span>,<span>000</span> for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.</p><p><span>Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to </span><span>\u201c</span><span>take a reasonable swing\u201d at electric propulsion.</span></p><p>Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.</p><h2>How Do Electric Boats Perform in Cold Weather?</h2><p><span></span><span>This summer, Leathers said he\u2019s had no trouble making the nearly 2-mile (3-kilometer) round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he\u2019s not sure how far the outboards\u2019 two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor\u2019s range. It\u2019s a part of Leathers\u2019s demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.</span></p><p>Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they\u2019re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of <span>2024</span>. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, <a href=\"https://www.shredelectric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shred Electric</a>, a boat\u2019s ability to run through the year\u2019s coldest months is a key selling point.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Planson. <span>\u201c</span>When you\u2019re working with\u2026waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.\u201d</p><p>Strater and Planson said their boat\u2019s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations 7 miles (11 kilometers) away. In the <span>10</span> months since the boat\u2019s launch, Strater has learned that range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat\u2019s pace depending on how far he wants to go.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d he said.</p><p><span></span><span>Soon, Maine\u2019s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level </span><span>2</span><span> charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over 2 hours, or three times as fast as the current system. The startup </span><a href=\"https://www.aqua-superpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua SuperPower</a><span> was awarded a portion of the </span><span>DOE</span><span> funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.</span></p><p>Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said Morris, of the Island Institute. As the state\u2019s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.</p><p>Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a <span>\u201c</span>chicken and egg\u201d problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there\u2019s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.</p><p>This challenge is compounded by both New England\u2019s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region\u2019s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it\u2019s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route <span>1</span>.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>There are a lot of complicated questions,\u201d Morris said. <span>\u201c</span>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to Maine, it\u2019s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.\u201d</p><p>Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm\u2019s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.</p><p><span></span><span>\u201c</span><span>As a whole industry, I think it\u2019s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,\u201d Leathers said. </span><span>\u201c</span><span>And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.\u201d</span> </p>"

According to a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050925008439\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> published earlier this year in the journal <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/procedia-computer-science\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Procedia Computer Science</em></a>, a range of industries face simulation bottlenecks where, the authors say, \u201cexecuting high-fidelity simulation can take even weeks per design.\u201d</p><p>Surrogate models, the <em>Procedia </em>authors note, involve whittling equations down to simplified versions of the larger simulation environments. In other words, the surrogates capture essential behaviors of specific systems being modeled but without so much <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whats-better-than-40-gpubased-servers-a-server-with-40-gpus\" target=\"_blank\">computational overhead</a>. Often this trimming-down process can involve strategically sampling the original complex model at key points, and then training a faster approximation that can predict results for new scenarios.</p><p>\u201cYou can evaluate these models instantaneously,\u201d Sjodin says of COMSOL\u2019s surrogate modeling system. \u201cWhereas if you solve the full model with unknown inputs, it could take you 15 minutes. And people are very impatient.\u201d</p><p>According to Sjodin, European automotive manufacturers are now using COMSOL\u2019s surrogate models to rapidly simulate entire electric vehicle battery packs, enabling real-time decisions that managers and engineers had once needed to wait a coffee break or longer for. Meanwhile, Sjodin adds, a Swiss institute has deployed the COMSOL surrogate system as an app for Indian farmers to predict food spoilage in cold storage. The surrogate simulation, the institute found, enabled the farmers to reduce food spoilage by 20 percent. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Visualization of microstrip patch antenna with 3D gain analysis in simulation software.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5d198\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/visualization-of-microstrip-patch-antenna-with-3d-gain-analysis-in-simulation-software.jpg?id=61723155&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">COMSOL\u2019s full numerical simulations predict performance of an antenna surface (right sphere), while its streamlined surrogate model (left sphere) arrives at nearly the same results in substantially less running time.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">COMSOL</small></p><h3>Making Multiphysics Into an App</h3><p>Sjodin says COMSOL intends to turn users of the simulation system into something closer to software developers in their own right.</p><p>\u201cYou can compile those apps into standalone executables that you can distribute around the world without any kind of license payment,\u201d Sjodin says.</p><p>The company\u2019s surrogate models, he says, are able to run as standalone applications, which can work on laptops or smartphones.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to give this to someone on the factory floor, these surrogate models are really useful because it allows you to evaluate and get results immediately,\u201d Sjodin says. <span>The models run quickly compared to the full multiphysics simulation</span><span> because the app version of, say, a specific battery pack\u2019s thermal performance and chemical composition comes pre-loaded. The simulation is fast, because it already has on hand pre-calculated parameters specific to the physical environment to be simulated\u2014and only the environment to be simulated.</span></p><p>In addition to AI smarts that speed up the computing time for each run, COMSOL relies on other tricks as well. What modelers call <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction\" target=\"_blank\">\u201creduced order\u201d models</a> (ROMs) involve optimizations like mathematical pattern recognition and slimming down some of the more complicated equations in a calculation. \u201c<span>Neural networks come into play there, but also other technologies, more traditional reduced order modeling technologies,\u201d he says.</span></p><p>For instance, in a 2024 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2406.00559v2\" target=\"_blank\">industry-wide review of ROMs</a>, researchers from Trieste, Italy\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_School_for_Advanced_Studies\" target=\"_blank\">International School for Advanced Studies</a> described a range of ROM techniques that are based on more than just AI or neural networks.</p><p>\u201cROMs are divided in two big families: intrusive methods, in which one manipulates directly the governing equations, and non-intrusive methods, in which only the simulation data are considered,\u201d the researchers wrote. The paper shows that a mixture of neural nets and more conventional mathematical ROM tools can achieve computational speedups up to 100,000 times as fast as models without ROM smarts added in.</p>"

The company says that the Eve 1V measures an object\u2019s motion with accuracy, repeatability, and reliability\u2014all without ever making contact with the material. That last point is key for the Eve 1V\u2019s intended environment: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductor-industry-in-india\" target=\"_blank\">Industrial manufacturing</a>.</p><p>Today\u2019s manufacturing lines are under pressure to deliver faster production, tighter tolerances, and zero defects, often while working with a wide variety of delicate materials. Traditional tactile tools such as measuring wheels and encoders can slip, wear out, and cause costly downtime. Many noncontact alternatives, while promising, are either too expensive or fall short in accuracy and reliability under real-world conditions, says <a href=\"https://investors.aeva.com/board-member/mina-rezk\" target=\"_blank\">Mina Rezk</a>, cofounder and chief technology officer at Aeva.</p><p>\u201cEve 1V was built to solve that exact gap: A compact, eye-safe, noncontact motion sensor that delivers submillimeter-per-second velocity accuracy without touching the material, so manufacturers can eliminate slippage errors, avoid material damage, and reduce maintenance-related downtime, enabling higher yield and more predictable operations,\u201d Rezk says.</p><p>Unlike traditional lidar that sends bursts of light and waits for those bursts to return to make measurements, FMCW continuously emits a low-power laser while sweeping its frequency. By comparing outgoing and returning signals, it detects frequency shifts that reveal both distance and velocity in real time. The additional measurement of an object\u2019s velocity to its position in three-dimensional space makes FMCW a type of 4D lidar.<strong></strong></p><p>Eve 1V is the second member of its Eve 1 family, following the launch of the <a href=\"https://investors.aeva.com/node/9096/pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://investors.aeva.com/node/9096/pdf\">Eve 1D earlier this year</a>. The Eve 1D is a compact displacement sensor capable of detecting movement at the micrometer scale, roughly 1/100 the thickness of a human hair. \u201cTogether, Eve 1D and Eve 1V show how we can take the same FMCW perception platform and tailor it for different industrial needs: Eve 1D for distance measurement and vibration detection, and Eve 1V for precise velocity and length measurement,\u201d Rezk says.</p><p>Future applications could extend into robotics, logistics, and consumer health, where noncontact sensing may enable the detection of microvibrations on human skin for accurate pulse and blood-pressure readings.</p><h2>FMCW Lidar for Precision Manufacturing</h2><p>The company\u2019s core FMCW architecture, originally developed for long-range 4D lidar for automobiles, can be adjusted through software and optics for highly precise motion sensing at close range in manufacturing, according to Rezk. This flexibility means the system can track extremely slow movements, down to fractions of a millimeter per second, in a factory setting, or it can monitor faster motion over longer distances in other applications.</p><p>By avoiding physical contact, Eve 1V eliminates wear and tear, slippage, contamination, or the need for physical access to the part. \u201cThat delivers three practical advantages in a factory: One, maintenance-free operation with no measuring wheels to replace or recalibrate; two, material friendliness\u2014you can measure delicate, soft, or textured surfaces without risk of damage, and three, operational robustness\u2014no slippage errors and fewer stoppages for service,\u201d Rezk says. Put together, that means more uptime, steady throughput, and less scrap, he adds.</p><p>When measuring velocity, engineers often rely on one of three tools: encoders, laser velocimeters, or camera-based systems. Each has its strengths and its drawbacks. Traditional encoders are low-cost but can wear down over time. Laser-based velocity-measurement systems, while precise, tend to be large and expensive, making them difficult to implement widely. And camera-based approaches can work for certain inspection tasks, but they usually require markers, controlled lighting, and complex processing to measure speed accurately.</p><p>Rezk says that the Eve 1V system offers a balance of these options. It provides precise and consistent velocity measurements without contacting material, making it compact, safe, and simple to install. Its outputs are comparable with existing encoder systems, and because it doesn\u2019t rely on physical contact, it requires minimal maintenance.</p><p>This approach helps cut down on wasted energy from slippage, eliminates the need for maintenance tied to parts that wear out, and ultimately lowers long-term operating costs\u2014especially when compared with traditional contact-based systems or expensive laser options.</p><p>This method avoids stitching together frame-by-frame comparisons and resists interference from sunlight, reflections, or ambient light. Built on silicon photonics, it scales from micrometer-level sensing to millimeter-level precision over longer ranges. The result is clean, repeatable data with minimal noise\u2014outperforming legacy lidar and camera-based systems.</p><p>Aeva is expecting to begin full production of the Eve 1V in early 2026. The Eve 1V reveal follows <a href=\"https://www.aeva.com/press/aeva-and-lg-innotek-form-strategic-collaboration-to-bring-next-generation-perception-platform-to-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.aeva.com/press/aeva-and-lg-innotek-form-strategic-collaboration-to-bring-next-generation-perception-platform-to-market/\">a recent partnership with LG Innotek</a>, a components subsidiary of South Korea\u2019s LG Group, under which Aeva will supply its Atlas Ultra 4D lidar for automobiles, with plans to expand the technology into consumer electronics, robotics, and industrial automation.</p>"

The ability to simulate multiple physical phenomena in a unified modeling environment gives engineers a deeper understanding of how different components of the grid interact with and affect each other.</p><p>For example, when designing the various components of grid infrastructure, such as transformers and transmission lines, multiphysics electromagnetic field analysis is essential for ensuring the safety of the surrounding individuals and environment. Understanding thermal behavior, another phenomenon involving multiple physics, is equally necessary for the design of grid components where heat dissipation and thermal stresses can significantly affect performance and lifespan. Structural and acoustics simulation, meanwhile, is used to predict and mitigate issues like transformer vibration and noise \u2014 an important practice for ensuring the longevity and reliability of grid components.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Multiphysics simulation provides critical insight into the complex interactions at play within power grid components, enabling engineers to virtually test and optimize future grid designs.</p><p>Electric breakdown and corona discharge analyses are particularly vital for high-voltage transmission lines, as such phenomena can compromise the performance of their insulation systems. Simulation allows development teams to predict where such events are likely to happen, enhancing the design of insulators and other components where the goal is to minimize energy loss and material degradation.</p><p><span>As a real-world example, one leading manufacturer uses the <a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae simulation software</a></span><a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics\"> software</a> to develop magnetic couplings, a noncontact alternative to mechanical transmission that enables power transfer without the inherent friction-based limitations of continual contact. While the advantage of friction-free power transmission means that magnetic couplings have found applications in a broad range of technologies, including offshore wind turbines, these systems must be developed carefully to avoid degradation. By employing highly nonlinear hysteresis curves and applying its own material temperature dependences for magnetic loading, the manufacturer\u2019s development team has successfully used multiphysics simulation to help prevent the permanent magnets from reaching critical temperatures, which can cause irreversible demagnetization and compromise the reliability of the designs. Additionally, due to the diverse nature of use cases for magnetic couplings, the company\u2019s design engineers must be able to interchange shapes and materials of magnets to meet customer requirements without building costly and time-consuming prototypes \u2014 rendering multiphysics simulation a powerful approach for characterizing configurations, providing virtual prototypes of their designs, and ultimately reducing the price for customers while remaining vigilant on fine details.</p><p>These examples show just a few of the ways that coupling multiple interacting physics within a single model can lead to successful simulation of real-world phenomena and thereby provide insights into current and future designs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Powerline tower on field; energetic aura and electric flow against a vivid blue sky\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b4c8e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/powerline-tower-on-field-energetic-aura-and-electric-flow-against-a-vivid-blue-sky.png?id=61634378&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Lightning strikes a tower\u2019s shielded wires.

A digital twin contains a high-fidelity description of a physical product, device, or process \u2014 from the microscopic to the macroscopic level \u2014 that closely mirrors its real <span>counterpart</span>. For every application, the digital twin is continuously receiving information, ensuring an up-to-date and accurate representation. </p><p><span>With this technology, grid operators and their equipment suppliers can predict which components are most likely to fail, enabling them to schedule maintenance and replacement more efficiently and thereby improving grid reliability. Digital twins can be made for equipment ranging from power sources including solar cells and wind turbines to power distribution systems and battery energy storage.</span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Illustration of sea-floor mounted wind turbines generating electricity.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d74bd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-sea-floor-mounted-wind-turbines-generating-electricity.png?id=61634379&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">An offshore wind farm where lightning strikes one of the turbine blades. The electric field on the turbine towers, seawater, and seabed is shown.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">COMSOL</small></p><p>The most recent modeling and simulation technology provides power and energy companies with tools for creating digital twins in the form of standalone simulation apps, which significantly increases the number of users who have access to advanced simulation technology. By including only relevant functionality in a standalone simulation app, colleagues with no modeling and simulation experience can utilize this technology without needing guidance from the modeling specialist. Furthermore, the use of data-driven surrogate models in simulation apps enables near-instantaneous evaluation of what would otherwise be time-consuming simulations \u2014 which means that simulation technology can now be used in a real-world setting.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Digital twins, in the form of standalone apps, bring the power of simulation to the field, where grid operators can utilize real-time performance information to ensure grid reliability.</p><p><span></span><span>For instance, one organization that works with local power companies to analyze equipment maintenance and failure built a custom app based on a multiphysics model it had developed to predict cable faults and improve troubleshooting efficiency. While engineers have been utilizing simulation in labs for decades, cable failure occurs in the field, and onsite troubleshooting personnel are responsible for assessing these failure conditions. With this in mind, an engineer at the organization developed the simulation app using the Application Builder in <a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL Multiphysics</a>\u00ae.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Colorful, stacked layers of a 3D model resembling a futuristic computer chip design.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"93733\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/colorful-stacked-layers-of-a-3d-model-resembling-a-futuristic-computer-chip-design.png?id=61634382&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Temperature distribution in a battery energy storage system (BESS).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">COMSOL</small></p><p>The app features relevant parameters that troubleshooting personnel with no prior simulation experience can easily modify. Field technicians enter cable data and select the type of <span>fault, which modifies the multiphysics model in real time, allowing the app to evaluate</span> and output the data necessary to understand the condition that led to the fault. The app then produces a reported potential and electric field, which leads the technicians to an informed decision regarding whether they need to replace or repair the cable. Following the app\u2019s successful deployment, the engineer who developed it stated, \u201cThe simulation app plays a key role in cable maintenance. It makes the work of our field technicians more efficient by empowering them to confidently assess and repair faults.\u201d</p><p>Routine physical tests of grid equipment cannot fully reflect conditions or determine failure types in many situations, as a large number of complex factors must be considered, such as cable structure and material, impurities in the cable, voltage fluctuation, and operating conditions and environments. As a result, simulation has proven to be indispensable in many cases for collecting accurate cable health assessments \u2014 and now in the form of custom apps, it is more accessible than ever.</p><h2>Generating Nuclear Solutions</h2><p>Simulation has also been heavily integrated into the design process of various components related to the nuclear industry. For example, simulation was used to help design generator circuit breakers (GCBs) for nuclear power plants. GCBs must be reliable and able to maintain performance even after long periods of inactivity. The COMSOL Multiphysics<sup>\u00ae</sup> software can be used to improve the current-carrying capacity of the GCBs, which can offer protection from current surges and provide dependable electricity generation. </p><p>The design of nuclear fusion machines like tokamaks has also benefitted from the use of simulation. These devices must be able to withstand high heat fluxes and plasma disruptions. COMSOL Multiphysics<sup>\u00ae</sup> has been used to help engineers predict the effects of these problems and come up with design solutions, such as adding a structural support system that can help reduce stress and survive challenging conditions.</p><h2>Engineering the Grid of Tomorrow</h2><p>The development of next-generation power grid systems is a complex and dynamic process that requires safe, reliable, and affordable testing. Multiphysics simulation technology can play a major role in future innovations for this industry, enabling engineers to anticipate and analyze the complex interactions happening inside these devices while building upon the existing infrastructure to address the demands of modern-day consumption.</p><p><span></span><em>COMSOL Multiphysics is a registered trademark of COMSOL AB.</em></p>"

There I worked with teachers and other parents to plan and implement annual programs that enriched the students and the school community as a whole.</p><p>Through my work, I\u2019ve realized that volunteering isn\u2019t just about giving back; it\u2019s also a way to learn new skills. Every hour invested adds tangible value to one\u2019s personal and professional growth.</p><p>My experiences have shown me that membership-based organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a> that offer volunteer opportunities should position and market them as top-tier member benefits. Even if not all members volunteer their time, the availability of the opportunities and the inspiration drawn from participating can be powerful catalysts for a more vibrant and committed community.</p><p>The merits of volunteering are universally known and acknowledged. Its powerful capacity to reduce stress and boost feel-good hormones such as dopamine is widely touted, as noted in a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/onemind/2022/11/01/employer-sponsored-volunteerism-doing-good-for-business-mental-health-and-the-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Forbes</em></em> article</a> by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/onemind/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Garen Staglin</a>, the cofounder of One Mind at Work. However, the impacts of volunteering extend far beyond the typical benefits of building a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, acquiring skills, and feeling a sense of fulfillment. The deeper value lies in its ability to enhance <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/tips-on-how-to-elevate-your-career/\" target=\"_self\">professional growth and personal development</a> in less apparent ways.</p><h2>The pros of volunteering</h2><p>Here are five ways in which the \u201cwhy\u201d of purpose can fuel the \u201chow\u201d of growth:</p><ol><li><strong>Opportunities for collaboration.</strong> Volunteering provides an arena for collaboration, bringing together professionals from industry and academia, for example, in tackling shared goals. The dynamic interchange is where true growth happens. It\u2019s not just about what gets done; it\u2019s about the invaluable experience of working with diverse minds to solve problems\u2014an experience that accelerates development in all areas.</li><li><strong>Incubator for leadership.</strong> In an organization such as IEEE, where volunteers are shaping its structure and future through committees and governance bodies, the environment is ideal for developing high-impact professional skills. Volunteering instills leadership skills\u2014including strategic thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to inspire others\u2014that can be utilized in one\u2019s professional (and personal) life.</li><li><strong>Sharpening decision-making abilities.</strong> Volunteering lets you sharpen skills that are sometimes difficult to improve in the structured confines of a typical job. Working outside the usual professional hierarchy, volunteers get a chance to sharpen their critical thinking and decision-making skills with greater autonomy and a clear, mission-driven focus. A volunteering task, such as judging submissions for awards and scholarships, can hone analytical and fair-judgment skills. Planning conferences and events can help develop organizational, project management, and problem-solving abilities.</li><li><strong>Intellectual expansion</strong>. Volunteering is a fantastic way to boost your intellect and uncover hidden potential. Through collaborative problem-solving and organic knowledge-sharing, one can tackle complex issues. As you move from one task to the next, the skills can build on each other, creating a compounding effect that rapidly enhances your abilities.</li><li><strong>Staying current, relatable, and confident. </strong>A cumulative benefit of volunteering is that it can serve as a professional refresh for one\u2019s skills and perspective and can expose you to new technologies and trends outside of your field. You can learn to connect and communicate more effectively across generations and backgrounds by working alongside a diverse group of people. The collaborative environment also can provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate expertise in new ways and receive peer recognition, which in turn can reinforce your professional value and boost your confidence.</li></ol><p>Volunteering isn\u2019t just for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/celebrating-young-professionals-and-students/\" target=\"_self\">young professionals</a>; it can be a catalyst for people at every stage of their career. It can boost mid-career professionals\u2019 confidence, enabling them to hone their skills and tackle new challenges. For senior-level professionals, volunteering can expand their networks, providing fresh perspectives and collaborative opportunities outside traditional silos.</p><p>Any organization that provides volunteering opportunities is providing members or employees a valuable chance for an active investment in themselves. </p>"
