        "summary": "This paper examines the motives, constraints, and sequencing behind Argentina\u2019s 2017 tax reform, drawing on the authors\u2019 direct involvement in its design and implementation. We document how a large inherited fiscal imbalance, a disinflation program that mechanically raised real pension spending under the pre-existing indexation rule, minority status in Congress, and limited administrative capacity jointly narrowed the feasible policy set. Within those constraints, the reform aimed to be near-revenue-neutral while rebalancing the system toward investment and employment: phasing down corporate rates with dividend taxation and inflation adjustment, reducing the labor wedge at the bottom via a per-worker deduction, rationalizing VAT and excises (including carbon and health-motivated taxes), and coordinating with provinces to cap and de-cascade the turnover tax (ISIB) through a Fiscal Consensus. We trace how coalition politics and sectoral vetoes reshaped the package, why forward guidance and escape clauses were embedded ex ante, and how the 2018 sudden stop, followed by policy reversals, limited the reform\u2019s realized growth dividend. We draw four lessons: credibility is a fiscal instrument; provincial coordination beats technocratic perfection; discretionary levers invite rent-seeking; and targeting informality and compliance margins yields higher returns than blunt rate changes. The analysis offers a pragmatic template for tax reform under macroeconomic fragility, federal fragmentation, and state-capacity constraints."

        "summary": "This paper examines the rise of high-skill migration from Asia to the United States over the past three decades and its consequences for both sending and receiving economies. Between 1990 and 2019, migrants from five Asian countries\u2014India, China, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines\u2014accounted for over one-third of the growth in US software developers and a quarter of the increase in scientists, engineers, and physicians. Drawing on census microdata, visa records, and administrative sources, I show how US demand for talent in information technology, higher education, and healthcare interacted with Asia\u2019s demographic and educational transformations to generate this migration boom. Policy reforms (notably the H-1B, F-1, and J-1 visa programs) and sectoral shifts\u2014such as the internet revolution, declining public support for universities, and aging-related healthcare demand\u2014created persistent needs for foreign students and workers. Asian economies were uniquely positioned to meet this demand through rapid tertiary expansion, strong STEM institutions, English proficiency, and diaspora networks. These inflows boosted US innovation, entrepreneurship, and service-sector productivity while fostering \u201cbrain gain\u201d and \u201cbrain circulation\u201d in Asia. Together, these trends reveal how talent flows from Asia have become central to the structure and growth of the modern US economy."

        "summary": "This paper examines the impact of the UK's decision to leave the European Union (Brexit) in 2016. Using almost a decade of data since the referendum, we combine simulations based on macro data with estimates derived from micro data collected through our Decision Maker Panel survey. These estimates suggest that by 2025, Brexit had reduced UK GDP by 6% to 8%, with the impact accumulating gradually over time. We estimate that investment was reduced by between 12% and 18%, employment by 3% to 4% and productivity by 3% to 4%. These large negative impacts reflect a combination of elevated uncertainty, reduced demand, diverted management time, and increased misallocation of resources from a protracted Brexit process. Comparing these with contemporary forecasts \u2013 providing a rare macro example to complement the burgeoning micro-literature of social science predictions \u2013 shows that these forecasts were accurate over a 5-year horizon, but they underestimated the impact over a decade."

        "summary": "We study how market power in artificial intelligence (AI) shapes wages and welfare in open-economy general equilibrium by treating AI as a priced, imported factor. Across three models, we separate technical efficiency from the impact of upstream price setting. In a two-traded-goods benchmark, the incidence of AI price changes depends on how sectoral skill intensity changes with AI prices; non-monotone intensity can generate \u201cdouble harm\u201d for unskilled workers (lower real wage after a large decrease in the price of AI, and real wage decreases further when the AI price rises as a result of market power). With one non-traded sector, we observe that the classic \u201cDutch disease\u201d effect here would arise when one sector gets more productive and draws labor away from other sectors, creating scarcity and raising prices; but this is not what we expect from the introduction of labor-substituting AI. In contrast, our last model considers two non-traded sectors and CES/free entry, and the opportunity for discrete adoption of technology that replaces unskilled labor from the AI-using sector. When AI reduces unit costs and increases variety, it will not pull U from non-tradables, instead it will displace workers from the AI-using sector and lower wage due to diminishing returns in alternative sectors. Strategic upstream pricing of AI then harms welfare through unit-cost (usage fees) and variety (access fees) channels, with income leakage abroad. We derive an adoption frontier tying feasible usage prices to displaced workers\u2019 outside options and show a monopolist typically prices on this boundary; capping one instrument shifts rents to the other. Broad gains for the adopting country relies on pressure (or regulation) on both usage and access fees and as well as policy that supports productive absorption of displaced labor. The framework clarifies when AI can lower real wages and aggregate welfare despite efficiency gains."

Using labor force surveys covering the informal sector, we show the minimum wage exhibits near full passthrough to informal employees working in formal firms, about half of all informal employees. The formal-to-informal reallocation elasticity with respect to the formal-wage is small: -0.28. Our findings illustrate how minimum wages can positively affect living standards for workers thought beyond the reach of labor law, a sizable share of the workforce in developing economies."

Using newly digitized bank and branch balance sheet data matched to state and county panels, we provide direct evidence that branching produced lasting productivity gains without aggregate capital deepening by leveraging internal capital markets to improve the geographic allocation of capital. Our novel ``deposit market access'' measure shows that bank funding grew most in capital-constrained counties within branching states. Both market access and border discontinuity designs indicate that branching\u2019s organizational structure reduced capital allocation frictions to generate persistent growth."

        "summary": "We study the causal effect of different early career occupational experiences on labor market outcomes. To do so, we pair over two decades of administrative tax data with internal personnel records from one of the largest employers of young adults in the United States: the US Army. Enlistees work in a diverse and varied set of occupations, including non-combat roles like mechanics, legal services, financial specialists, cooks, dental hygienists, police officers, and network/computer specialists. Occupational eligibility is determined by test score cutoffs which we leverage in a series of 35 regression discontinuity designs. We find that a typical early career occupational experience generates a substantial amount of path dependence, with point estimates that suggest a 19p.p. increase in the likelihood of being observed in an identical or closely related occupation as much as 20 years later. The corresponding impact of different occupations on earnings are highly heterogeneous, yet predictable: long-run changes in the average earnings of the occupations applicants are pushed into, and pulled out-of, can explain over 60% of the causal variation across cutoffs, with point estimates that suggest improvements in occupational earnings premia translate dollar-for-dollar into economic success. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of early career occupational experience as a key channel for promoting long-run well-being among young adults who are not college bound."

But there was a short period, roughly 36 months, when it was possible to get a licensed Mac that had the blessing of the team in Cupertino.</p><p>They called it the Mac clone era. It was Apple\u2019s direct response to a PC market that had come to embrace open architectures\u2014and, over time, made Apple\u2019s own offerings seem small.</p><div class=\"badge_module shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\">\n<a class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" href=\"https://tedium.co/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"Tedium logo, a red rectangle with the word Tedium in white, above the text &quot;This post originally appeared on Tedium.&quot;\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/tedium-logo-a-red-rectangle-with-the-word-tedium-in-white-above-the-text-this-post-originally-appeared-on-tedium.png?id=60568211&amp;width=1800&amp;quality=85\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>During that period, from early 1995 to late 1997, you could get legally licensed Macs from a series of startups now forgotten to history, as well as one of Apple\u2019s own major suppliers at the time, Motorola. And it was great for bargain hunters who, for perhaps the first time in Apple\u2019s history, had a legit way to avoid the Apple tax.</p><p>But that period ended fairly quickly, in large part thanks to the man whose fundamental aversion to clone-makers likely caused the no-clones policy in the first place: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/10-lessons-from-steve-jobs\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Jobs</a>.</p><p>\u201cIt was the dumbest thing in the world to let companies making crappier hardware use our operating system and cut into our sales,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Steve_Jobs/8U2oAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA336&amp;printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jobs told Walter Isaacson</a> in his 2011 biography.</p><p>Apple has generally avoided giving up its golden goose because the company was built around vertical integration. If you went into a CompUSA and bought a Mac, you were buying the full package, hardware and software, made by Apple. This had benefits and downsides. Because Apple charged a premium for its devices (unlike other vertical integrators, such as Commodore and Atari), it tended to relegate the company to a smaller part of the market. On the other hand, that product was highly polished.</p><p>That meant Apple needed to be good at two wildly disparate skill sets\u2014and protect others from stealing Apple\u2019s software prowess for their own cheaper hardware.</p><p>While historians can point to the rise of unofficial <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2017/05/04/apple-ii-clones-franklin-vtech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple II clones</a> in the \u201880s, and modern Apple fans can still technically build <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/04/08/hackintosh-proxmox-vm-experience/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hackintoshes</a> on Intel hardware, Apple\u2019s own Mac clone program came and went in just a few short years.</p><p>It was a painful lesson.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of an Outbound Notebook's RAM slots.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e29a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-an-outbound-notebook-s-ram-slots.jpg?id=62164700&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This Outbound Notebook wasn\u2019t sold with Apple features, but allowed users to insert a Mac ROM, a component that helped Apple limit cloning. However, the ROM had to come from a genuine, working Apple computer. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chaosdruid/Wikimedia Commons</small></p><h3>Why Apple was afraid of Mac clones</h3><p>For years, companies attempted to wrangle the Mac out of Apple\u2019s hands, corporate blessing or no. Apple, highly focused on vertical integration, used its ROM chips as a way to limit the flow of MacOS to potential clone-makers. This mostly worked, as the Mac\u2019s operating system was far more complex and harder to reverse-engineer than the firmware used by the IBM PC.</p><p>But plenty still tried. For example, <a href=\"https://lowendmac.com/2016/unitron-mac-512-a-contraband-mac-512k-from-brazil/\" target=\"_blank\">a Brazilian company named Unitron</a> sold a direct clone of the Macintosh 512K, which fell off the market only after a Brazilian trade body intervened. Later, a company named Akkord Technology attempted to sell a reverse-engineered device called the Jonathan, but ended up attracting <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/MacUser9007July1990/page/n49/mode/2up?q=Akkord+\" target=\"_blank\">a police raid</a> instead.</p><p>Somewhat more concerning for Apple\u2019s exclusivity: Early Macs shared much of their hardware architecture with other popular machines, particularly the <a href=\"https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/amax\" target=\"_blank\">Commodore Amiga</a> and <a href=\"https://www.atarimania.com/utility-atari-st-spectre-gcr_31462.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atari ST</a>, each of which received peripherals that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v4BaWwoyA0&amp;t=1s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introduced Mac software support</a> and made it easier to work across platforms.</p><p>But despite claims that this ROM-based approach was technically legal, it\u2019s not like any of this was explicitly allowed by Apple. At one point, <em><em>Infoworld</em></em> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=gjoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">responded to a letter to the editor</a> about this phenomenon with a curt note: \u201cApple continually reaffirms its intention to protect its ROM and to prevent the cloning of the Mac.\u201d </p><p>So what <em><em>was</em></em> Apple OK with? Full-on conversions, which took the hardware of an existing Mac, and rejiggered its many parts into an entirely new product. There are many examples of this throughout Apple\u2019s history\u2014such as the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/03/axiotron-modbook-tablet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ModBook</a>, a pre-iPad Mac tablet\u2014but the idea started with Chuck Colby.</p><p>Colby, an early PC clone-maker who was friends with Apple team members like Steve Wozniak, <a href=\"https://www.digibarn.com/friends/chuck-colby/mac-colby.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was already offering a portable Mac conversion</a> called the MacColby at one of the Mac\u2019s introductory events in 1984. (Apparently Apple CEO John Sculley bought two\u2014but never paid for them.)</p><p>One of Colby\u2019s later conversions, the semi-portable Walkmac, had earned a significant niche audience. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/walkmac-revisited-the-inside-story-of-the-first-portable-mac/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A 2013 <em><em>CNET</em></em> piece</a> notes that the rock band Grateful Dead and news anchor Peter Jennings were both customers, and that Apple would actually send Colby referrals.</p><p>So, why did Colby get the red-carpet treatment while other clone-makers were facing lawsuits and police raids? You still needed a Mac to do the aftermarket surgery, so Apple still got its cut. <span>One has to wonder: Would Apple have been better off just giving Chuck Colby, or any other interested party, a license to make their own clones? After all, it\u2019s not like Colby\u2019s ultra-niche portables were going to compete with Apple\u2019s experience. Right?</span></p><p>During the 1980s, this argument was basically a nonstarter\u2014the company even went so far as to change its dealer policy to limit the resale of its system ROMs for non-repair purposes. But by the 1990s, things were beginning to thaw.</p><p>You can thank a firm named NuTek for the nudge.<strong> </strong>The company, like Apple, was based in Cupertino, California, and it spent years talking up its reverse-engineering plans.</p><p>\u201cNutek will do for Mac users what the first IBM-compatible developers did in the early 1980s: open up the market to increased innovation and competition by enabling major independent third-party manufacture,\u201d explained Benjamin Chou, the company\u2019s CEO, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=7S6aSlz957QC&amp;pg=PA16\" target=\"_blank\">in a 1991 <em><em>ComputerWorld</em></em> piece</a>.</p><p>And by 1993, it had built a \u201cgood enough\u201d analogue of the Mac that could run most, but not all, Mac programs. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested the top 15 software applications and 13 of those worked,\u201d <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=cTwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chou told <em><em>InfoWorld</em></em></a>, an impressive boast until you hear the non-working apps are Microsoft Works and Excel.</p><p>It failed to make a splash, but NuTek\u2019s efforts nonetheless exposed a thaw in Apple\u2019s thinking. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9104_April_1991/page/n121/mode/2up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A 1991 <em><em>MacWorld</em></em> piece</a> on NuTek\u2019s reverse engineering attempt <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9104_April_1991/page/n127/mode/2up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">quoted Apple Chief Operating Officer Michael Spindler</a> as saying, \u201cIt is not a question of whether Apple will license its operating system, but how it will do this.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Windows was finally making inroads in the market, and Apple was ready to bend.</p><h3>The moment Apple changed its mind about clones</h3><p>There was a time when it looked like MacOS was about to become a Novell product. Really. In 1992, Apple held very serious talks <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2021/03/24/novell-apple-macos-history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with the networking software provider</a> about selling, and it almost happened. ThenMichael Spindler became Apple\u2019s CEO in 1993 and killed the Novell experiment, but not the idea of licensing MacOS. It just needed the right partner.</p><p>It found one with Stephen Kahng\u2019s Power Computing. Kahng, a veteran of the clone wars, first made waves in the PC market with the clone-maker <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Jy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leading Edge</a>, and he wanted to repeat that feat with the Mac. And his new firm, Power Computing, was offering an inroad for Apple to potentially score similar success.</p><p>And so, in the waning days of 1994, just before the annual MacWorld conference, the news hit the wires: Apple was getting an authorized clone-maker. It turns out that the key was just to wait for the right CEO to take over, then ask nicely. </p><p>Though the idea may have looked rosy at first, some saw some dark clouds over the whole thing. Famed tech columnist John C. Dvorak suggested that Kahng was more dangerous than he seemed. \u201cApple is not going to know what hit them,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/29/business/for-apple-clones-and-competition.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told <em><em>The New York Times</em></em></a>.</p><p>And there were other signs that Apple was starting to lose its identity. A <em><em>PC Magazine</em></em> analysis from early 1995 perhaps put the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=79i1lfAqumUC&amp;pg=PA29\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biggest frowny-face</a> on the story:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Apple\u2019s decision to create a clone market may or may not be successful, but it didn\u2019t really have a choice. At the recent MacWorld conference, one of the most popular technical seminars was given by Microsoft. It covered how Mac programmers can learn to write Windows applications.</p><p>One can see why Apple might have been attracted to this model, in retrospect. The company was a bit lost in the market at the time, and needed a strategy to expand its shrinking base of users.</p><p>But the clone market did not expand its base. Instead, it invited a price war.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A PowerComputing PowerCenter Pro 210 running Mac OS 7.6.1\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d6523\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-powercomputing-powercenter-pro-210-running-mac-os-7-6-1.jpg?id=62164712&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A PowerCenter Pro 210, a Macintosh clone manufactured by Power Computing Corporation.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angelgreat/Wikimedia Commons</small></p><h3>Why licensed Mac clones didn\u2019t work</h3><p>The best time for Apple to introduce a clone program was probably a decade earlier, in 1985 or 1986. At the time, people like Chuck Colby were inventing new kinds of Macs that didn\u2019t directly compete with what Apple was making. Furthermore, the concept of a Mac was new, just as desred for its form factor as its software. </p><p>In hindsight, it\u2019s clear that 1995 <em><em>wasn\u2019t</em></em> a good time to do so. The decision put a mirror against Apple\u2019s own offerings, which attempted to hit every possible market segment\u201447 different device variants that year alone, per <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/macs-released-in-1995.html\" target=\"_blank\">EveryMac</a>.</p><p>This didn\u2019t reflect well on Apple\u2014and companies like Power Computing exploited that to offer cheaper hardware. The company\u2019s Power 100, for example, scored basically identical performance to the Macintosh 8100/100, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=aS7TOePnRDAC&amp;pg=PA48\" target=\"_blank\">while cutting more than US $1,000</a> off the Apple product\u2019s $4,400 price tag. Meanwhile, other machines, such as the <a href=\"https://lowendmac.com/1995/daystar-genesis-mp/\" target=\"_blank\">DayStar Genesis MP</a>, outpaced Apple\u2019s own ability to hit the high end. </p><p>Both of these machines, in their own ways, hit at a key problem with Apple\u2019s mid-\u201990s industrial design. Before the iMac revolutionized Apple computers upon its 1998 release, Macs simply didn\u2019t have enough of a \u201cwow factor\u201d driving the industrial design. It made the Mac about the software, not the hardware.</p><p>Within a year or two, it was clear that Apple had begun to undermine its own bottom line. When Chuck Colby put a Mac motherboard in a new chassis, Apple kept its high margins. But Power Computing\u2019s beige boxes ate into Apple\u2019s market share, and the MacOS-makers also got a far smaller cut.</p><p><span>There likely was a magic point at which Power Computing\u2019s scale would have made up for the loss in hardware revenue. But in the era of Windows 95, Apple needed a partner that would go toe-to-toe with Packard Bell. Instead, these cut-rate Macs only attracted the already converted, undercutting Apple along the way.</span></p><p>\u201cI would guess that somewhere around 99 percent of their sales went to the existing customer base,\u201d then-CFO Fred Anderson <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1997/09/apple-kills-clone-market/\" target=\"_blank\">told <em><em>Wired</em></em> in 1997</a>.</p><p>The company only figured this part out after Steve Jobs returned to the fold.</p><h3>Apple\u2019s retreat from cloning</h3><p>The course correction got messy: Jobs, in the midst of trying to fix this situation in his overly passionate way, might have harmed the evolution of the PowerPC chip, for example. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB892507589126559000?st=SGhrTb&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\">A 1998 piece</a> from the <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em> notes that Jobs\u2019 tough negotiations over clones damaged its relationship with Motorola, its primary CPU supplier, to the point the company pledged it would no longer go the extra mile for Apple.</p><p>\u201cThey will be just another customer,\u201d a Motorola employee told the paper.</p><p>Power Computing\u2014which had an apparent <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=HOYtntaY99UC&amp;pg=PA242\" target=\"_blank\">$500 million in revenue</a> in 1996 alone\u2014got a somewhat softer landing, though not without its share of drama. Apple had pushed the company to agree to a new licensing deal even before Jobs took over as CEO, and once he did, it was clear the companies would not see eye to eye. The company\u2019s then-president, Joel Kocher, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1997/08/power-computing-rank-and-file-grow-restless/\" target=\"_blank\">attempted to take the battle to MacWorld</a>, where he forced a public confrontation over the issue. The board disagreed with Kocher\u2019s actions, Kocher quit, and ultimately the company <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/apple-purchases-power-computing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sold most of its assets</a> to Apple for $100 million, effectively killing the market entirely.</p><p>The only clone-maker that Apple seemed willing to play ball with was the company UMAX. The reason? Its SuperMac line had figured out how to hit the low-end market, an area Apple has famously struggled to hit. Apple wanted UMAX to focus on the sub-$1,000 market, especially in parts of the world where Apple lacks a foothold. But UMAX didn\u2019t want the low-end if it couldn\u2019t keep a foothold in the more lucrative high end, and it chose to dip out on its own. </p><p>The situation highlighted the ultimate problems with cloning\u2014a loss of control, and a lack of alignment between licensor and licensee.</p><p>Apple restricted the licenses, making these System 7 clones, for the most part, restricted from (legally) upgrading to Mac OS 8. It did the trick\u2014and starved the clone-makers out.</p><h3>The one time Steve Jobs flirted with a Mac clone</h3><p>That would be the end of the Apple clone story, except for one dangling thread: Steve Jobs once attempted to make an exception to his aversion to clones.<span>In the early 2000s, Jobs pitched Sony on the idea of putting Mac OS X on its VAIO desktops and laptops, essentially because he felt it was the only product line that matched what Apple was doing from a visual standpoint.</span></p><p>Jobs looked up to Sony and its cofounder Morita Akio, even offering a eulogy for Akio after his passing. (<a href=\"https://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00010/\" target=\"_blank\">Nippon</a>, upon Jobs\u2019 passing, called the Apple founder\u2019s appreciation for the country and its companies \u201ca reciprocal love affair.\u201d) But Sony had already done the work with Windows, so <a href=\"https://nobi.com/en/Steve%20Jobs%20and%20Japan/entry-1212.html\" target=\"_blank\">it wasn\u2019t to be</a>. </p><p>On Sony\u2019s part, it sounds like the kind of prudent decision Jobs made when he killed the clones a few years earlier.</p>"

Its GPUs powered search engines, video apps, smartphones, electric vehicles, and the current wave of generative AI models. Even as Washington tightened export rules for advanced AI chips, Chinese companies kept settling for and buying \u201cChina-only\u201d Nvidia chips stripped of their most advanced features\u2014H800, A800, and H20.</p><p><span>But by 2025, patience in Beijing had seemingly snapped. State media began labeling Nvidia\u2019s China-compliant H20 as <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3321411/nvidias-h20-chips-face-growing-chinese-distrust-over-alleged-back-doors-15-revenue-deal\" target=\"_blank\">unsafe and possibly compromised with hidden \u201cbackdoors.\u201d</a> Regulators <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3320240/chinas-cyberspace-regulator-summons-nvidia-explain-h20-chips-alleged-back-door-risks\" target=\"_blank\">summoned</a> company executives for questioning, while reports from <em>The Financial Times</em> surfaced that tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12adf92d-3e34-428a-8d61-c9169511915c\" target=\"_blank\">quietly told to cancel new Nvidia GPU orders.</a> The Chinese AI startup DeepSeek also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/deepseek-hints-latest-model-supported-by-chinas-next-generation-homegrown-ai-chips.html\" target=\"_blank\">signaled</a> in August that its next model will be designed to run on China\u2019s \u201cnext-generation\u201d domestic AI chips.</span></p><p><span>The message was clear: China could no longer bet its AI future on an U.S. supplier. If Nvidia wouldn\u2019t\u2014or couldn\u2019t\u2014sell its best hardware in China, domestic alternatives must fill the void by designing specialized chips for both AI training (building models) and AI inference (running them).</span></p><p>That\u2019s difficult\u2014in fact, some say it\u2019s impossible. Nvidia\u2019s chips set the global benchmark for AI computing power. Matching them requires not just raw silicon performance but memory, interconnection bandwidth, software ecosystems, and above all, production capacity at scale.</p><p>Still, a few contenders have emerged as China\u2019s best hope: Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, and Cambricon. Each tells a different story about China\u2019s bid to reinvent its AI hardware stack.</p><h2>Huawei\u2019s AI Chips Are in the Lead</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"People at an AI conference stop to look at a display of servers that stretches across the room. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6d9d5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/people-at-an-ai-conference-stop-to-look-at-a-display-of-servers-that-stretches-across-the-room.jpg?id=62132455&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Huawei is betting on rack-scale supercomputing clusters that pool thousands of chips together for massive gains in computing power. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">VCG/Getty Images</small></p><p>If Nvidia is out, Huawei, one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, looks like the natural replacement. Its Ascend line of AI chips has matured under the U.S. sanctions, and in September 2025 the company laid out a multi-year public roadmap:</p><ul><li>Ascend 950, expected in 2026 with a performance target of 1 petaflop in the low-precision FP8 format that\u2019s commonly used in AI chips. It will have 128 to 144 gigabytes of on-chip memory, and interconnect bandwidths (a measure of how fast it moves data between components) of up to 2 terabytes per second.</li><li>Ascend 960, expected in 2027, is projected to double the 950\u2019s capabilities.</li><li>Ascend 970 is further down the line, and promises significant leaps in both compute power and memory bandwidth.</li></ul><p>The current offering is the Ascend 910B, introduced after U.S. sanctions cut Huawei off from global suppliers. Roughly comparable to the A100, Nvidia\u2019s top chip in 2020, it became the de facto option for companies who couldn\u2019t get Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. One Huawei official even claimed the 910B outperformed the A100 by around 20 percent in some training tasks in 2024. But the chip still relies on an older type of <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/leashing-chinese-ai-needs-smart-chip-controls.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">high-speed memory (HBM2E)</a>, and can\u2019t match Nvidia\u2019s H20: It holds about a third less data in memory and transfers data between chips about 40 percent more slowly.</p><p><span>The company\u2019s latest answer is the 910C, a dual-chiplet design that fuses two 910Bs. In theory, it can approach the performance of Nvidia\u2019s H100 chip (Nvidia\u2019s flagship chip until 2024); Huawei showcased a 384-chip Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD cluster that reached roughly 300 Pflops of compute, implying that each 910C can deliver just under 800 teraflops when performing calculations in the FP16 format. That\u2019s still shy of the H100\u2019s roughly 2,000 Tflops, but it\u2019s enough to train large-scale models if deployed at scale. </span>In fact, Huawei has detailed how they used Ascend AI chips to train DeepSeek-like models.</p><p>To address the performance gap at the single-chip level, Huawei is betting on rack-scale supercomputing clusters that pool thousands of chips together for massive gains in computing power. Building on its Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD, the company plans to launch the Atlas 950 SuperPoD in 2026, linking 8,192 Ascend chips to deliver 8 exaflops of FP8 performance, backed by 1,152 TB of memory and 16.3 petabytes per second of interconnect bandwidth. The cluster will span a footprint larger than two full basketball courts. Looking further ahead, Huawei\u2019s Atlas 960 SuperPoD is set to scale up to 15,488 Ascend chips.</p><p>Hardware isn\u2019t Huawei\u2019s only play. Its MindSpore deep learning framework and lower-level CANN software are designed to lock customers into its ecosystem, offering a domestic alternative to PyTorch (a popular framework from Meta) and CUDA (Nvidia\u2019s platform for programming GPUs) respectively.</p><p>State-backed firms and U.S.-sanctioned companies like iFlytek, 360, and SenseTime have already signed on as Huawei clients. The Chinese tech giants ByteDance and Baidu also ordered small batches of chips for trial.</p><p>Yet Huawei isn\u2019t an automatic winner. Chinese telecom operators such as China Mobile and Unicom, which are also responsible for building China\u2019s data centers, remain wary of Huawei\u2019s influence. They often prefer to mix GPUs and AI chips from different suppliers rather than fully commit to Huawei. Big internet platforms, meanwhile, worry that partnering too closely could hand Huawei leverage over their own intellectual property.</p><p>Even so, Huawei is better positioned than ever to take on Nvidia.</p><h2>Alibaba Pushes AI Chips to Protect Its Cloud Business</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A tall server rack has the words Alibaba Cloud Server Panjiu AI Infra 2.0 written at the top.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2111f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-tall-server-rack-has-the-words-alibaba-cloud-server-panjiu-ai-infra-2-0-written-at-the-top.jpg?id=62132469&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Alibaba Cloud\u2019s business depends on reliable access to training-grade AI chips. So it\u2019s making its own. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sun Pengxiong/VCG/Getty Images</small></p><p>Alibaba\u2019s chip unit, T-Head, was founded in 2018 with modest ambitions around open-source RISC-V processors and data center servers. Today, it\u2019s emerging as one of China\u2019s most aggressive bids to compete with Nvidia.</p><p>T-Head\u2019s first AI chip is the Hanguang 800 chip, an efficient chip designed for AI inference that was announced in 2019; it\u2019s able to process 78,000 images per second and optimize recommendation algorithms and large language models (LLMs). Built on a 12-nanometer process with around 17 billion transistors, the chip can perform up to 820 trillion operations per second (TOPS) and access its memory at speeds of around 512 GB per second.</p><p>But its latest design\u2014the PPU chip\u2014is something else entirely. Built with 96 GB of high-bandwidth memory and support for high-speed PCIe 5.0 connections, the PPU is pitched as a direct rival to Nvidia\u2019s H20.</p><p>During a state-backed television program featuring a China Unicom data center, the PPU was presented as capable of rivaling Nvidia\u2019s H20. Reports suggest this data center runs over 16,000 PPUs out of 22,000 chips in total. <em>The Information</em> also reported that Alibaba has been <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/alibaba-baidu-adopt-ai-chips-major-shift-chinese-tech\" target=\"_blank\">using its AI chips</a> to train LLMs.</p><p>Besides chips, Alibaba Cloud lately also upgraded its supernode server, named <a href=\"https://x.com/poezhao0605/status/1970782067958149414\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Panjiu</span></a>, which now features 128 AI chips per rack, modular design for easy upgrades, and fully liquid cooling.</p><p>For Alibaba, the motivation is as much about cloud dominance as national policy. Its Alibaba Cloud business depends on reliable access to training-grade chips. By making its own silicon competitive with Nvidia\u2019s, Alibaba keeps its infrastructure roadmap under its own control.</p><h2>Baidu\u2019s Big Chip Reveal in 2025</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man on stage is dwarfed by enormous imagery of server racks alongside Chinese characters. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0025e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-on-stage-is-dwarfed-by-enormous-imagery-of-server-racks-alongside-chinese-characters.jpg?id=62132479&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At a recent developer conference, Baidu unveiled a 30,000-chip cluster powered by its third-generation P800 processors.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images</small></p><p>Baidu\u2019s chip story began long before today\u2019s AI frenzy. As early as 2011, the search giant was experimenting with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate its deep learning workloads for search and advertising. That internal project later grew into Kunlun.</p><p>The first generation arrived in 2018. Kunlun 1 was built on Samsung\u2019s 14-nm process, and delivered around 260 TOPS with a peak memory bandwidth of 512 GB per second. Three years later came Kunlun 2, a modest upgrade. Fabricated on a 7-nm node, it pushed performance to 256 TOPS for low-precision INT8 calculations and 128 Tflops for FP16, all while reducing power to about 120 watts. Baidu aimed this second generation less at training and more at inference-heavy tasks such as its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tesla-robotaxi-chinese-competitors\" target=\"_self\">Apollo autonomous cars</a> and Baidu AI Cloud services. Also in 2021, Baidu spun off Kunlun into an independent company called Kunlunxin, which was then valued at US $2 billion.</p><p><span>For years, little surfaced about Kunlun\u2019s progress. But that changed dramatically in 2025. At its developer conference, Baidu unveiled a 30,000-chip cluster powered by its third-generation P800 processors. Each P800 chip, according to research by Guosen Securities, reaches roughly 345 Tflops at FP16, putting it in the same level as Huawei\u2019s 910B and Nvidia\u2019s A100. Its interconnect bandwidth is reportedly close to Nvidia\u2019s H20. Baidu pitched the system as capable of training \u201cDeepSeek-like\u201d models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Baidu\u2019s latest multimodal models, the Qianfan-VL family of models with 3 billion, 8 billion, and 70 billion parameters, were all trained on its Kunlun P800 chips.</span></p><p>Kunlun\u2019s ambitions extend beyond Baidu\u2019s internal demands. This year, Kunlun chips secured orders worth over 1 billion yuan (about $139 million) for China Mobile\u2019s AI projects. That news helped restore investor confidence: Baidu\u2019s stock is up 64 percent this year, with the Kunlun reveal playing a central role in that rise.</p><p>Just today, Baidu <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/11/13/news-baidu-rolls-out-kunlun-roadmap-m100-m300-ai-chips-arrive-2026-2027/\" target=\"_blank\">announced its roadmap for its AI chips</a>, promising to roll out a new product every year for the next five years. In 2026, the company will launch the M100, optimized for large-scale inference, and in 2027 the M300 will arrive, optimized for training and inference of massive multimodal models. Baidu hasn\u2019t yet released details about the chips\u2019 parameters.</p><p><span>Still, challenges loom. Samsung has been Baidu\u2019s foundry partner from day one, producing Kunlun chips on advanced process nodes. Yet reports from Seoul suggest Samsung has paused production of <a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/08/01/ETCXKAQ7GFDPNLZBZTTGHZTR3A/\" target=\"_blank\">Baidu\u2019s 4-nm</a> designs.</span></p><h2>Cambricon\u2019s Chip Moves Make Waves in the Stock Market</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A closeup shows a small silver and black chip with the word Cambricon at the top.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bf8ef\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-closeup-shows-a-small-silver-and-black-chip-with-the-word-cambricon-at-the-top.jpg?id=62132486&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cambricon struggled in the early 2020s, with chips like the MLU 290 that couldn\u2019t compete with Nvidia chips. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images</small></p><p>The chip company Cambricon is probably the best performing publicly traded company on China\u2019s domestic stock market. Over the past 12 months, Cambricon\u2019s share price has jumped nearly 500 percent.</p><p>The company was officially spun out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016, but its roots stretch back to a 2008 research program focused on brain-inspired processors for deep learning. By the mid-2010s, the founders believed AI-specific chips were the future.</p><p>In its early years, Cambricon focused on accelerators called neural processing units (NPUs) for both mobile devices and servers. Huawei was a crucial first customer, licensing Cambricon\u2019s designs for its Kirin mobile processors. But as Huawei pivoted to develop its own chips, Cambricon lost a flagship partner, forcing it to expand quickly into edge and cloud accelerators. Backing from Alibaba, Lenovo, iFlytek, and major state-linked funds helped push Cambricon\u2019s valuation to $2.5 billion by 2018 and eventually landing it on Shanghai\u2019s Nasdaq-like STAR Market in 2020.</p><p>The next few years were rough. Revenues fell, investors pulled back, and the company bled cash while struggling to keep up with Nvidia\u2019s breakneck pace. For a while, Cambricon looked like another cautionary tale of Chinese semiconductor ambition. But by late 2024, fortunes began to change. The company returned to profitability, thanks in large part to its newest MLU series of chips.</p><p>That product line has steadily matured. The MLU 290, built on a 7-nm process with 46 billion transistors, was designed for hybrid training and inference tasks, with interconnect technology that could scale to clusters of more than 1,000 chips. The follow-up MLU 370, the last version before Cambricon was sanctioned by the United States government in 2022, can reach 96 Tflops at FP16.</p><p>Cambricon\u2019s real deal came with the MLU 590 in 2023. The 590 was built on 7-nm and delivered peak performance of <a href=\"https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20250826A08Y4I00\" target=\"_blank\"><span>345 Tflops at FP16</span></a>, with some reports suggesting it could even surpass Nvidia\u2019s H20 in certain scenarios. Importantly, it introduced support for less-precise data formats like FP8, which eased memory bandwidth pressure and boosted efficiency. This chip didn\u2019t just mark a leap\u2014it turned Cambricon\u2019s finances around, restoring confidence that the company could deliver commercially viable products.</p><p>Now all eyes are on the MLU 690, currently in development. Industry chatter suggests it could approach, or even rival, Nvidia\u2019s H100 in some metrics. Expected upgrades include denser compute cores, stronger memory bandwidth, and further refinements in FP8 support. If successful, it would catapult Cambricon from \u201cdomestic alternative\u201d status to a genuine competitor at the global frontier.</p><p>Cambricon still faces hurdles: its chips aren\u2019t yet produced at the same scale as Huawei\u2019s or Alibaba\u2019s, and past instability makes buyers cautious. But symbolically, its comeback matters. Once dismissed as a struggling startup, Cambricon is now seen as proof that China\u2019s domestic chip path can yield profitable, high-performance products.</p><h2>A Geopolitical Tug-of-War</h2><p>At its core, the battle over Nvidia\u2019s place in China isn\u2019t really about teraflops or bandwidth. It\u2019s about control. Washington sees chip restrictions as a way to protect national security and slow Beijing\u2019s advance in AI. Beijing sees rejecting Nvidia as a way to reduce strategic vulnerability, even if it means temporarily living with less powerful hardware.</p><p>China\u2019s big four contenders, Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, and Cambricon, along with other smaller players such as Biren, Muxi, and Suiyuan, don\u2019t yet offer the real substitutes. Most of their offerings are barely comparable with A100, Nvidia\u2019s best chips five years ago, and they are working to catch up with H100, which was available three years ago.</p><p>Each player is also bundling its chips with proprietary software and stacks. This approach could force Chinese developers accustomed to Nvidia\u2019s CUDA to spend more time adapting their AI models which, in turn, could affect both training and inference.</p><p>DeepSeek\u2019s development of its next AI model, for example, has reportedly been delayed. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb984646-6320-4bfe-a78d-a1da2274b092\" target=\"_blank\"><span>The primary reason</span></a> appears to be the company\u2019s effort to run more of its AI training or inference on Huawei\u2019s chips.</p><p>The question is not whether Chinese companies can build chips\u2014they clearly can. The question is whether and when they can match Nvidia\u2019s combination of performance, software support, and trust from end-users. On that front, the jury\u2019s still out.</p><p>But one thing is certain: China no longer wants to play second fiddle in the world\u2019s most important technology race.</p>"

Those LEGO-style hands getting media attention didn\u2019t have the strength needed for a wearable device, the prints themselves had too many inaccuracies, and the designs were\u2014as you may imagine an entirely plastic object to be\u2014deeply uncomfortable.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of Quorum's 3D-printed prostheses socket.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8fce8\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-quorum-s-3d-printed-prostheses-socket.jpg?id=62149737&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Quorum\u2019s 3D-printed prostheses socket.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Quorum</small></p><p>The so-called \u201cTrough of Disillusionment\u201d followed. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-johnson-07413b216/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Johnson</a>, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.quorumprosthetics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quorum Prosthetics</a> in Windsor, Colorado, saw prosthetists shy away from 3D printing technologies for years. Johnson stuck it out, though, waiting for  technology and bureaucracy to catch up to his ambition. A milestone happened last year when U.S. medical insurers released an \u201cL-code\u201d specifically for adjustable sockets for prosthetic limbs. An L-code allows durable medical equipment\u2014such as prosthetics\u2014to be handled for billing within the U.S. insurance system. <span>Quorum\u2019s engineers responded with a sophisticated, adjustable socket utilizing 3D printing. Quorum\u2019s design can adjust both volume and compression on residual limbs, making a better fit, like tightening your shoe laces.</span></p><p>Despite its high-tech and sleek appearance, Johnson says his socket <em>could</em> be made using traditional methods. But 3D printing makes it a \u201cbit better and easier.\u201d \u201cWhen you look at overall cost of labor,\u201d says Johnson, \u201cit just keeps going up. To manufacture one of our sockets would take a technician 12 or 16 hours to make [using traditional methods].\u201d Using 3D printing, he says \u201cwe can make five overnight.\u201d As a result, Quorum spends less on technician labor.</p><p>However, there are new costs. Quorum needs to pay for software subscriptions and licenses on top of the overhead required to operate a nearly one-million dollar Hewlett-Packard 3D printer. \u201cWe have to spend $50,000 on the A/C unit just to control the humidity,\u201d says Johnson. At the end of the day, it costs over $1000 to print each socket, even when they print multiple sockets together. The costs are actually now higher than if Quorum didn\u2019t use 3D printing to manufacture prostheses, but Johnson believes the quality is superior. \u201cYou can see more patients. [3D printing] is so precise and less adjustments need to be made.\u201d This has meant fewer follow-up visits for patients and, for many, better fits.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A doctor adjusting a prosthetic liner on their seated patient's leg.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30aab\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-doctor-adjusting-a-prosthetic-liner-on-their-seated-patient-s-leg.jpg?id=62149626&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Operation Namaste is using 3D printing to standardized the liners for prosthetic limb sockets.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Operation Namaste</small></p><h2>Why hasn\u2019t 3D printing lowered costs?</h2><p>When I asked <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-erenstone-439145140/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Erenstone,</a> a prosthetist for over two decades and founder of prosthetic limb non-profit <a href=\"https://www.operationnamaste.org/copy-of-what-we-do\" target=\"_blank\">Operation Namaste,</a> why 3D printed designs hadn\u2019t lowered costs, he said Quorum is \u201cable to make a socket that was not possible before 3D printing\u2014very next level socket and sophistication. What they are making isn\u2019t lowering costs any more than Ferrari is lowering costs. They are making the Ferrari of sockets.\u201d</p><p>But Erenstone says the technology is finally getting closer to achieving some of the things everyone imagined was possible ten years ago. Namely, the ability to share designs around the world and increase communication between practitioners has been life-changing. Ernestone set his sights on cracking the code around prosthetic liners\u2014the silicone, flexible socks that prosthesis-users roll up onto their residual limb before inserting it into the prosthesis socket. Liners from one of the most common brands, <a href=\"https://www.ossur.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Ossur</a>, are sold for many hundreds of dollars each, but are vital for a prosthetic to be comfortable enough to wear all day. To bring high quality liners to prosthesis-users in low-resourced countries, Operation Namaste is standardizing the molds to make silicone liners. Clinicians anywhere in the world can print the mold using inexpensive 3D printers and about $22 in materials and local labor costs to produce a high-quality silicone liner. \u201c3D printing has value in low income countries because accessibility is so much harder,\u201d explains Erenstone. \u201cI have not seen it [have as much value] in the urban areas where there is adequate prosthetic care.\u201d</p><p>3D printing has been especially helpful in war zones such as Ukraine and Sudan, where it may be unsafe for prosthetists to visit from abroad and there are very few resources. Canada-based <a href=\"https://www.victoriahandproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Victoria Hand Project </a>identifies prosthetics and orthotics clinics around the world, sets them up with a 3D print lab, and trains the clinicians in 3D printing software. Where 3D printing has made a difference is increasing knowledge sharing between practitioners and increasing the availability of low-cost designs. It is unclear, however, whether prosthetics printed with cheaper 3D printers hold up compared to conventional time-tested, body-powered, low-cost designs. Quorum Prosthetics operates a nonprofit called <a href=\"https://www.onelegatatime.net/about\" target=\"_blank\">One Leg at a Time </a>in Tanzania, where they train local people in 3D scanning and measuring of residual limbs, but these scans are sent back to Colorado, where an industrial multi-jet fusion printer actually prints the hands. Local Tanzanians may be trained to use the new technology, but the best equipment to finish the task is still out of their reach.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of Unlimited Tomorrow's prosthetic hand, which has intricate hinges resembling the bone structure of a human hand.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f5c7b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-unlimited-tomorrow-s-prosthetic-hand-which-has-intricate-hinges-resembling-the-bone-structure-of-a-human-hand.jpg?id=62149566&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Unlimited Tomorrow\u2019s TrueLimb</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Unlimited Tomorrow</small></p><h2>Can 3D-printed prosthetics be cheaper?</h2><p>The goal of using 3D printing to make prosthesis less expensive is still being pursued, but non-technical issues pose significant obstacles<span>. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/easton-lachappelle-8a373299/\" target=\"_blank\">Easton LaChapelle</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.unlimitedtomorrow.com/truelimb/\" target=\"_blank\">Unlimited Tomorrow,</a> sought to leverage 3D printing\u2014a technology he fell in love with as a teenager\u2014to create a high-functioning, low-cost hand to rival the clunky multi-articulating prosthetic hands on the market. The result was the TrueLimb, a $7,000  prosthetic hand so intricate in its appearance it looks as if it was carved from wood. The TrueLimb was sold directly to consumers in an effort to bypass the headaches of medical insurance, but even at $7,000\u2014about 1/10th the cost of other multi-articulating <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4968852/\" target=\"_blank\">myoelectric hands</a>\u2014the hand proved too expensive for many. Customers approached LaChapelle and asked for them to take insurance. Unlimited Tomorrow then started working with prosthetists who had to decide between billing insurance companies for (for example) a German-made prosthetic hand for tens of thousands of dollars versus the TrueLimb. \u201cProsthetists were hesitant to work with us because our price point was so low, they couldn\u2019t mark it up to what they are used to,\u201d explains LaChapelle. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the technology is in these circumstances. Unlimited Tomorrow could have produced the best device, but clinicians are like \u2018why would I bill for a TrueLimb when I could bill a <a href=\"https://www.ottobock.com/en-gb/prosthetics/upper-limb-prosthetics/bebionic\" target=\"_blank\">Bebionic</a>?\u2019\u201d As a result, TrueLimb\u2019s cost shot up.</span></p><p>Soon enough, says LaChapelle, \u201cWe became exactly the problem we tried to solve. We were just another fancy arm that cost a bunch of money and for the consumer there was still an out of pocket expense.\u201d LaChapelle decided it was unethical to continue this way and has put Unlimited Tomorrow \u201con pause.\u201d In the meantime, he\u2019s working on commercializing some of the innovations he and his team of engineers stumbled upon along the way, such as their haptic glove system, which they hope will take hold in virtual reality applications. \u201cThe US [prosthetics] market is not gonna change,\u201d he says with dismay. With the profits from their glove, he hopes to focus on developing a \u201cbadass body-powered [prosthetic] device\u201d to distribute through a nonprofit.</p><p>The insurance companies are innovating, too, and not in a helpful way. While 3D printed devices now have official, codified L-codes that prosthetists across the US can bill, Joe Johnson says insurance companies don\u2019t care about the benefits of 3D printed devices. \u201cThe lawyers have reached a level of sophistication of writing policy that they can write around mandates [that should guarantee coverage],\u201d Johnson explains. \u201cWe have certain prosthetic mandates for coverage but the insurance companies have become very sophisticated. They\u2019re betting on you giving up.\u201d Insurance companies still refuse to cover even microprocessor-enabled knees, says Johnson, a technology which is going on twenty-five years old. He and his team entertained the possibility of trying to recycle microprocessor knees to increase their affordability to many patients. In a not-to-distant future, they imagined insurance companies would find new ways to thwart their efforts. Says Johnson: \u201cThey\u2019d totally brick those knees.\u201d</p><p><em>This article was supported by the IEEE Foundation and a John C. Taenzer fellowship grant.</em></p>"

Menifee, by contrast, is producing operational data in real households.</p><h2>Why CCS Matters</h2><p>When electric vehicles first hit the market, CCS was designed for one job: move power quickly from the grid to the car. The main goal was reliable, standardized, fast charging. That fact helps explain the difference between CCS public chargers, (many of which are rated for 350-kilowatts or more) and their CHAdeMO-based counterparts, which typically max out at 100 kW (but are capable of providing home backup or grid services).</p><p>Bidirectional operation wasn\u2019t included in the original CCS standard for several reasons. Early automakers and utilities worried about safety risks, grid interference, and added hardware cost. So CCS\u2019s original communication protocol linking EVs and charging stations\u2014<a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/55365.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 15118</a>\u2014didn\u2019t even include an electronic handshake for power export. The 2022 update, <a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/iso/iso15118202022?ad_acct=0000&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=1042027569&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_gXFXvQl5EQDGOCEFGoh01iGDy7&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvJHIBhCgARIsAEQnWlD3zc6ZUuyEO-qdCkAL2-Kv1Mvg3Cz3_Ew5PD8jfmM0o-JDSdJ3YHsaAvwfEALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 15118-20</a>, added secure two-way communication, enabling CCS vehicles to supply energy to buildings and the grid.</p><p>Wallbox\u2019s Quasar 2 residential charger implements the update through an active-bridge converter circuit built with silicon-carbide transistors, achieving efficient bidirectional flow. Its <a href=\"https://support.wallbox.com/wp-content/uploads/ht_kb/2025/04/Datasheet_QX2NA_EN_0225.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12-kW</a> power rating can support typical critical loads in a house, such as heating and cooling, refrigeration, and networking, says <a href=\"https://es.linkedin.com/in/aleix-maix%C3%A9-sas-28a6724b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aleix Maix\u00e9 Sas</a>, a system electronics architect at Wallbox.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An electric SUV plugged into a charger that is mounted on the exterior of a residential garage.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fb01e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-electric-suv-plugged-into-a-charger-that-is-mounted-on-the-exterior-of-a-residential-garage.jpg?id=62054284&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">As the company\u2019s name humbly suggests, Wallbox\u2019s chargers look like plain old boxes\u2014although they contain high-tech components.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Wallbox</small></p><h2>The Menifee blueprint</h2><p>Each of the Menifee homes outfitted with a V2H system combines a rooftop solar array with a 13-kWh <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/solar/sunpower-sunvault-review/\" target=\"_blank\">SunVault</a> stationary battery from <a href=\"https://us.sunpower.com/home-solar/solar-battery-storage\" target=\"_blank\">SunPower</a>. During normal operation, solar energy powers daily household loads and charges the stationary battery. On abundantly sunny days, the solar panels can also top up the Kia EV9\u2019s battery. When the grid fails\u2014or when energy prices spike\u2014the home isolates itself: Solar power and energy stored in the SunVault keep essential systems and appliances going, while the EV battery extends power if the outage persists.</p><p>This past summer, the UC Irvine researchers tracked how solar output, stationary storage, and vehicle power interacted under summer demand and wildfire-related grid stress. They found that \u201cthe vehicle adds a major resilience feature,\u201d according to Samuelsen, who is the <span>Menifee project manager. \u201cIt can relieve grid strain, increase renewable utilization, and lower costs by supplying power during peak-rate hours.\u201d</span></p><h2>Engineering the Two-Way Home</h2><p>Home builders and the makers of electric vehicle service equipment such as Wallbox are not the only entities reconsidering how to meet the engineering demands V2H introduces. Utilities, too, must make changes to accommodate bidirectional power flow. Interconnection procedures and energy pricing structures are among the factors that must be redesigned or reconsidered.</p><h2>A Glimpse of the Energy Future</h2><p>Analysts expect <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/bidirectional-charging.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">double-digit annual growth in bidirectional-charging system sales</a> through the late 2020s as costs fall and standards mature. In regions facing wildfire- or storm-related outages and steep time-of-use pricing curves, projects like Menifee\u2019s are showing a clear path towards the use of cars as huge and flexible energy reserves.</p><p>When EV batteries can supply energy for homes as easily as they do for propulsion, the boundary between transportation and energy will begin to disappear\u2014and with it, old concepts regarding who\u2019s an energy supplier and who\u2019s a customer.</p>"

Company executives call the Metaplant North America\u2019s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.\u2019s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan\u2019s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota.

As in many new factories, you\u2019ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.</p><p>Outside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant\u2019s electricity.

But this high-altitude confab is no Victorian perambulation. It\u2019s a vital component of a sprawling, cutting-edge project that is pushing the boundaries of bioinformatics and the tools of modern genomics. These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of<a href=\"https://www.projectpsyche.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Project Psyche</a>, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. <a href=\"https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9760/\" target=\"_blank\">Psyche</a> is part of a larger effort, the<a href=\"https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Darwin Tree of Life project</a>, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the<a href=\"https://www.earthbiogenome.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Earth BioGenome Project</a>. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of <em><em>all</em></em> of Earth\u2019s roughly 1.8 million organisms\u2014every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that\u2019s made up of cells that have a nucleus.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\"><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a></p><p>None of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it\u2019s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal\u2014to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035\u2014won\u2019t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>But the project\u2019s success may ultimately hinge on functions <em><em>other</em></em> than sequencing. For example, after a creature\u2019s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data\u2014consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs\u2014must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, <em><em>before</em></em> an organism\u2019s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it\u2019s an animal, capture it. As I discovered with the Psyche team in the woods, valleys, and jagged peaks of South Tyrol, wrangling insects presents challenges that can defy logistics, technology, and even reason.</p><h2>How Can You Explain the Surpassingly Strange Atlas Blue Butterfly? </h2><p>When I first heard about Project Psyche, the first thing I wondered was, Why Lepidoptera? I put the question to<a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/wright-charlotte/\" target=\"_blank\"> Charlotte Wright</a> and<a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/meier-joana/\" target=\"_blank\"> Joana Meier</a> at the hotel in Malles Venosta, Italy, that served as the headquarters for the Project Psyche expedition. They lead the project from its base at the<a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> in Cambridgeshire, England. The reasons, they tell me, span a range from pure science to completely commercial.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A young woman wearing pale blue gloves dissects a moth.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2328a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-woman-wearing-pale-blue-gloves-dissects-a-moth.jpg?id=61998917&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" An image shows a closeup of the moth being dissected.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"45973\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-image-shows-a-closeup-of-the-moth-being-dissected.jpg?id=61998914&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the Hotel Tyrol in the Italian Alps, lepidopterist Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, dissects the yellow tiger moth captured near the stone hut.

By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, \u201cwe can find out how they have evolved and how they\u2019ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.\u201d</p><p>Those genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell\u2019s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature\u2019s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01098-X\" target=\"_blank\"> Atlas blue butterfly</a>, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.</p><p>The Atlas blue is \u201ca very good example of something that\u2019s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,\u201d says Meier. \u201cWhat we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications\u201d\u2014thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. \u201cThen we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, \u2018What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that\u2019s broken?\u2019 \u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Some three dozen species of Lepidoptera are seen pinned to a display board, with tiny hand-written notes associated with each one.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a9f32\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/some-three-dozen-species-of-lepidoptera-are-seen-pinned-to-a-display-board-with-tiny-hand-written-notes-associated-with-each-on.jpg?id=61998921&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>And it\u2019s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data.

He\u2019s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he\u2019s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it\u2019s black). He\u2019s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth\u2019s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.</p><p>The objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different \u201cmicroenvironments,\u201d he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there\u2019s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young man in a bright blue T-shirt and black cargo pants standing on a slope amid brilliant purple wildflowers swings a bright yellow butterfly net.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"70ee6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-man-in-a-bright-blue-t-shirt-and-black-cargo-pants-standing-on-a-slope-amid-brilliant-purple-wildflowers-swings-a-brigh.jpg?id=61998951&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Genetics researcher No\u00e9 Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Luigi Avantaggiato        </small></p><p>\u201cOver there\u201d\u2014he points across the valley to the opposite slope. \u201cIt faces north.

As the sky darkens to a deep blue, we trudge back to the hut to stoke the fire and wait.</p><p>At the crack of dawn the next day, Moro is jubilant as he returns with the night\u2019s haul. There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they\u2019ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

It\u2019s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can\u2019t even fly at night or in the rain. \u201cButterflies are just day-flying moths,\u201d Wahlberg quips. \u201cPeople think of them as different and special, but they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>In this new era of mass genome sequencing, they\u2019re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera\u2014about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 <a href=\"https://www.ourbreathingplanet.com/6-fabulous-european-lepidoptera/\" target=\"_blank\">European Lepidoptera</a> species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg\u2019s reckoning. And they\u2019ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.</p><p>So the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the<a href=\"https://www.lesfruitsdemer.com/wild-statia-what-are-micromoths/\" target=\"_blank\"> micromoths</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/size-really-doesnt-matter-when-it-comes-to-micro-and-macro-moths.html\" target=\"_blank\">Micromoths</a> have long vexed entomologists. The largest of them have wingspans about as wide as a U.S. dime, or a 2 euro cent coin; <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/tiniest-moths-in-the-world.html\" target=\"_blank\">the smallest</a> can fit on the head of a pin. As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as \u201cmacromoths\u201d). There are a <em><em>lot</em></em> of micromoths\u2014at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young woman stands at night next to a plastic vessel, about a meter tall, which is lit from within by a purple glow.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d5d8d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-woman-stands-at-night-next-to-a-plastic-vessel-about-a-meter-tall-which-is-lit-from-within-by-a-purple-glow.jpg?id=61999056&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>That\u2019s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes.

It\u2019s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there\u2019s a mitochondrial gene, called<a href=\"https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1937-the-ideal-barcoding-gene\" target=\"_blank\"> CO1</a>, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. \u201cWe have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,\u201d Wahlberg says. \u201cAnd only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/dna-barcoding-species-detection-and-high-throughput-assays-71860\" target=\"_blank\">DNA barcoding</a> was invented in the early 2000s by<a href=\"https://scienceline.org/2008/02/tweed-bio-dnabarcoding/\" target=\"_blank\"> Paul Hebert</a> and colleagues at the<a href=\"https://www.uoguelph.ca/\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Guelph</a>, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it. The technique starts with a minuscule sample of tissue; for example, in the makeshift lab at the hotel in Malles Venosta, researchers dissecting moths for sequencing also removed, for DNA barcoding, a leg of each moth whose species was not conclusively known.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman wearing a white lab coat retrieves boxes from a cold-storage unit.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f2165\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-wearing-a-white-lab-coat-retrieves-boxes-from-a-cold-storage-unit.jpg?id=61999084&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A closeup shows the tops of small vials, each containing a tissue sample, within a box.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"af894\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-closeup-shows-the-tops-of-small-vials-each-containing-a-tissue-sample-within-a-box.jpg?id=61999081&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sta\ufb00 Scientist Silvia P\u00e9rez Lluch of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona retrieves tissue samples for genome sequencing.

The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-9-214\" target=\"_blank\"> 100 to 250 base pairs</a>. Conversely, \u201csuper-barcodes,\u201d which can be many thousands of base pairs, are useful for differentiating among closely related species\u2014exactly the challenge with many of the micromoths.</p><h2>Why RNA Will Make Annotating Faster</h2><p>While the Psyche researchers honed the logistics and mechanics of sampling Lepidoptera, a different European Lepidoptera project was quietly making a technical advance that could resonate throughout the Earth BioGenome Project.

After sequencing, the mass of fragmented genetic data must be assembled into a complete genome sequence and then that complete sequence must be manually verified, in a process called curation, and then annotated. In annotation, the genome\u2019s many genes are identified and, ideally, their functions described.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A bespectacled man in a dark blue T-shirt stands next to a storage cabinet with his arms folded across his chest.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"085c4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-bespectacled-man-in-a-dark-blue-t-shirt-stands-next-to-a-storage-cabinet-with-his-arms-folded-across-his-chest.jpg?id=61999096&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Gen\u00f3mico in Barcelona, has high hopes for an emerging technique to identify the genes within a large mass of genetic data.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>Today, curation and annotation are time-consuming processes, regarded as major bottlenecks to the rapid progress that the Earth BioGenome Project desperately needs to reach its 2035 goal. Finding the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411012682#:~:text=Summary,basis%20of%20long%2Ddistance%20migration\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of genes</a> within the huge mass of sequenced data is a mostly automated process now but it can involve some serious bioinformatic sleuthing. \u201cYou take your linear genome, your sequence, and you go and you say, \u2018Ah, look here. There\u2019s a gene that starts here,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.cnag.eu/ivo-g-gut\" target=\"_blank\"> Ivo Gut</a>, director of the<a href=\"https://www.cnag.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Centro Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Gen\u00f3mico</a> (CNAG), in Barcelona. \u201c \u2018And this is the structure of the gene.\u2019 And then you can sort of figure out what that is. You look whether that gene is known, for example, in another species. And then you go to the next one, and so on. And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,\u201d of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.</p><p>Gut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\"> ribonucleic acid</a>. When a gene specifies, or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hudsonalpha.org/edna-gene-expression/\" target=\"_blank\">expresses</a>,\u201d a protein, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\">RNA</a> acts as the \u201cmessenger,\u201d carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.</p><p>The breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a>, in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>.\u201d] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations\u2014CNAG, the<a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Centre for Genomic Regulation</a> (CRG), the<a href=\"https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Institute of Evolutionary Biology</a> at Pompeu Fabra University, and the<a href=\"https://web.ub.edu/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Barcelona</a>\u2014and from<a href=\"https://ari.ad/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Andorra Research and Innovation</a>, in Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria.</p><p>The genome of the female <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaena_helle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">violet copper butterfly</a>, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs. By using long-read sequencing of the RNA in the sample, the researchers were able to identify 20,122 protein-coding genes and 4,264 noncoding genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4687140/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">very difficult to predict by computational means</a>. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says <a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/roderic_guigo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Roderic Guig\u00f3 Serra</a>, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.</p><p>\u201cLong-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,\u201d he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, \u201cwe get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,\u201d Serra declares.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A woman wearing a white lab coat and lavender gloves holds a pipette above a black colored box roughly the size of desktop printer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"27c81\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-wearing-a-white-lab-coat-and-lavender-gloves-holds-a-pipette-above-a-black-colored-box-roughly-the-size-of-desktop-print.jpg?id=61999110&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the Guig\u00f2 Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>His group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species\u2014including humans. They\u2019re doing this through <a href=\"https://www.gencodegenes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gencode</a>, an international consortium that aims to produce improved, \u201creference\u201d annotations for the human and mouse genomes. Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it\u2014particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39554180/\" target=\"_blank\">18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes</a>. \u201cThese genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,\u201d says Serra.</p><p>Researchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world\u2019s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe\u2019s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.</p><p>It\u2019s a mammoth task. As they grapple with it, its practitioners can take inspiration from the novelist and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov. \u201cMy loathings are simple,\u201d<a href=\"https://dianedooley.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/the-strong-opinions-of-vladimir-nabokov/\" target=\"_blank\"> he wrote in 1973</a>. \u201cStupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music.

But her second formative undergrad experience involved a different type of exclusion: Berry was one of only a few engineering students who were female or Black. \u201cIt sometimes could be a lonely experience,\u201d says Berry. \u201cRepresentation does matter.\u201d</p><p>Now, Berry is a professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at <a href=\"https://www.rose-hulman.edu/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, where her students learn about human-robot interactions and mobile robotics by using actual robots. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three people of color, including Professor Carlotta Berry in the center,  talk about a tabletop modular robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c4601\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-people-of-color-including-professor-carlotta-berry-in-the-center-talk-about-a-tabletop-modular-robot.jpg?id=62000379&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Berry works on her first open-source modular 3D-printed robot, the LilyBot, with Rose-Hulman engineering students Murari Srinivasan (left) and Josiah McGee (right). </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Bryan Cantwell/Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</small></p><p><span>She also works to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/supporting-black-scholars-in-robotics\" target=\"_blank\">support people of color in engineering</a>. Almost three decades after she graduated, Berry realized little progress had been made when she heard Black women grad students describe feeling isolated and marginalized during an online engineering conference in 2020. \u201cThis was exactly how I felt 30 years ago,\u201d says Berry, noting that today only about </span><a href=\"https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/only-8-electronics-engineering-workforce-are-women\" target=\"_blank\">8 percent</a><span> of electronics engineers are women and about </span><a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/electrical-engineer-jobs/demographics/\" target=\"_blank\">5 percent</a><span> are Black. \u201cIt was time for something to change.\u201d</span></p><h2>Berry\u2019s Path to Teaching</h2><p>As a child in Nashville, Berry excelled at school\u2014especially math\u2014and thought she\u2019d become a math teacher. But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what an engineer was,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone who was an engineer.\u201d After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.gatech.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> as part of a dual degree program with <a href=\"https://www.spelman.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Spelman College</a>, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s in mathematics in 1992.</p><p>After her bachelor\u2019s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master\u2019s in electrical engineering and control systems at <a href=\"https://wayne.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wayne State University</a> in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. \u201cI really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,\u201d she says. </p><p>After a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Vanderbilt University</a> in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school\u2014and at last found herself on the right career path: \u201cI always wanted to be an educator,\u201d she says. </p><h2>A Turn Toward Outreach</h2><p>Berry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three women of color sit in front of signs about Girls in STEM.

Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman\u2019s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Griffin Museum of Science and Industry</small></p><p>\u201cAs a full professor, I don\u2019t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I provide education for students and for the community, that\u2019s also part of my research and service.\u201d <span>For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.</span></p><p>Since 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, \u201cto the streets.\u201d</p><p>Berry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/sphero-indi-brings-robotics-to-prekindergarten\" target=\"_blank\">kids just a few years old</a> to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, \u201cvisibility matters.\u201d</p><p>With any audience, Berry is always \u201cvery approachable and very engaging,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicki-manion/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicki Manion</a>, a program manager for Rose-Hulman\u2019s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.</p><p>\u201cI have to go where people are,\u201d Berry says. \u201cI get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.\u201d</p><p>This past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics\u2014sense, plan, act\u2014the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.</p><p>Last year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.</p><h2>Online Community and Writing</h2><p><span>Berry hasn\u2019t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded <a href=\"https://blackinengineering.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Engineering</a> and <a href=\"https://blackinrobotics.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Robotics</a>\u2014part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it\u2019s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. \u201cThere were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,\u201d she says.</span></p><p>Her professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: \u201cThat was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.\u201d In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the <a href=\"https://swe.org/magazine/dee-award-berry-22/\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Women Engineers</a> and <a href=\"https://ghc.anitab.org/awards-programs/abie-awards\" target=\"_blank\">AnitaB.org</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"The book cover for There's a Robot in My Closet, by Dr. Carlotta A.

The heroine of h</span><span>er book </span><em><em>Elevated Inferno</em></em><span>, Berry says, struggles with the expectation to flawlessly juggle work and life\u2014an expectation that falls more heavily on women, she finds.) </span></p><p>While balancing her many personal and professional interests, Berry says, she maintains a clear-eyed pursuit of her professional mission: helping people of diverse backgrounds \u201csee themselves as not just consumers of technology but creators of technology.\u201d</p>"

I say \u2018generally,\u2019 because <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/edible-robots\" target=\"_self\">edible robots are actually a thing</a>\u2014and not just edible in the sense that you can technically swallow them and suffer <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/magnetic-pill-sized-robot-cartwheel\" target=\"_self\">both the benefits and consequences</a>, but <em><em>ingestible</em></em>, where you can <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/edible-robots-2667244222\" target=\"_self\">take a big bite out of the robot</a>, chew it up, and swallow it.</p><p>Yum.</p><p>But so far these ingestible robots have included a very please-don\u2019t-ingest-this asterisk: the motor and battery, which are definitely toxic and probably don\u2019t taste all that good. The problem has been that soft, ingestible actuators run on gas pressure, requiring pumps and valves to function, neither of which are easy to make without plastic and metal. But in <a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202509350\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a new paper</a>, researchers from <a href=\"https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dario Floreano\u2019s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL in Switzerland</a> have demonstrated ingestible versions of both of batteries and actuators, resulting in what is, as far as I know, the first entirely ingestible robot capable of controlled actuation.</p><hr /><p><br /></p> <p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An ingestible actuator.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ae250\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-ingestible-actuator.jpg?id=62176243&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">EPFL</small></p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the battery on this lil\u2019 guy. In a broad sense, a battery is just a system for storing and releasing energy. In the case of this particular robot, the battery is made of gelatin and wax. It stores chemical energy in chambers containing liquid citric acid and baking soda, both of which you can safely eat. The citric acid is kept separate from the baking soda by a membrane, and enough pressure on the chamber containing the acid will puncture that membrane, allowing the acid to slowly drip onto the baking soda. This activates the battery and begins to generate CO<sub>2</sub> gas, along with sodium citrate (common in all kinds of foods, from cheese to sour candy) as a byproduct.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"GIF of an ingestible battery operating.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a618d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/gif-of-an-ingestible-battery-operating.gif?id=62177237&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">EPFL</small></p><p><span>The CO2 gas travels through gelatin tubing into the actuator, which is of a </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-selfhealing-materials-for-robots-that-cannot-be-destroyed\" target=\"_self\">fairly common soft robotic design</a> that uses interconnected gas chambers on top of a slightly stiffer base that bends when pressurized. Pressurizing the actuator gets you one single actuation, but to make the actuator wiggle (wiggling being an absolutely necessary skill for any robot), the gas has to be cyclically released. The key to doing this is the other major innovation here: an ingestible valve. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-left\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"GIF of an ingestible valve snap-buckling.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d39c6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/gif-of-an-ingestible-valve-snap-buckling.gif?id=62166207&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">EPFL</small></p><p><span>The valve operates based on the principle of snap-buckling, which means that it\u2019s happiest in one shape (closed), but if you put it under enough pressure, it rapidly snaps open and then closed again once the pressure is released. The current version of the robot operates at about four bending cycles per minute over a period of a couple of minutes before the battery goes dead.</span></p><p>And so there you go: a battery, a valve, and an actuator, all ingestible, makes for a little wiggly robot, also ingestible. Great! But <em><em>why</em></em>?</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p>\u201cA potential use case for our system is to provide nutrition or medication for elusive animals, such as wild boars,\u201d says lead author Bokeon Kwak. \u201cWild boars are attracted to live moving prey, and in our case, it\u2019s the edible actuator that mimics it.\u201d The concept is that you could infuse something like a swine flu vaccine into the robot. Because it\u2019s cheap to manufacture, safe to deploy, completely biodegradable, and wiggly, it could potentially serve as an effective strategy for targeted mass delivery to the kind of animals that nobody wants to get close to. And it\u2019s obviously not just wild boars\u2014by tuning the size and motion characteristics of the robot, what triggers it, and its smell and taste, you could target pretty much any animal that finds wiggly things appealing. And that includes humans!</p><p>Kwak says that if you were to eat this robot, the actuator and valve would taste a little bit sweet, since they have glycerol in them, with a texture like gummy candy. The pneumatic battery would be crunchy on the outside and sour on the inside (like a lemon) thanks to the citric acid. While this work doesn\u2019t focus specifically on taste, the researchers have made other versions of the actuator that were flavored with grenadine. They <a href=\"https://swissnex.org/news/first-tasting-of-the-robocake-epfl/\" target=\"_blank\">served these actuators out to humans earlier this year</a>, and are working on an \u2018analysis of consumer experience\u2019 which I can only assume is a requirement before announcing a partnership with Haribo. </p><p>Eatability, though, is not the primary focus of the robot, says PI Dario Floreano. \u201cIf you look at it from the broader perspective of environmental and sustainable robotics, the pneumatic battery and valve system is a key enabling technology, because it\u2019s compatible with all sorts of biodegradable pneumatic robots.\u201d And even if you\u2019re not particularly concerned with all the environmental stuff, which you really should be, in the context of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/otherlab-apsara-aerial-delivery-system\" target=\"_self\">large swarms of robots in the wild</a> it\u2019s critical to focus on simplicity and affordability just to be able to usefully scale.</p><p>This is all part of the EU-funded <a href=\"https://www.robofood.org/research/\" target=\"_blank\">RoboFood project</a>, and Kwak is currently working on other edible robots. For example, the elastic snap-buckling behavior in this robot\u2019s valve is sort of battery-like in that it\u2019s storing and releasing elastic energy, and with some tweaking, Kwak is hoping that edible elastic power sources might be the key for <a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admt.202401230\" target=\"_blank\">tasty little jumping robots that jump right off the dessert plate and into your mouth</a>.</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p><a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202509350\" target=\"_blank\">Edible Pneumatic Battery for Sustained and Repeated Robot Actuation</a>, by Bokeon Kwak, Shuhang Zhang, Alexander Keller, Qiukai Qi, Jonathan Rossiter, and Dario Floreano from EPFL, is published in <em><em>Advanced Science</em></em></p><p>.</p>"

Then came the much-hyped and much-derided <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/google-gets-in-your-face\" target=\"_self\">Google Glass</a> in 2012, and frankly, it still seemed a silly question.</p><p>Now, though, it\u2019s a choice consumers are beginning to make. Tiny displays, shrinking processors, advanced battery designs, and wireless communications are coming together in a new generation of smart glasses that display information that\u2019s actually useful right in front of you. But the big question remains: Just why would you want to do that?</p><p>Some tech companies are betting that today\u2019s smart glasses will be the perfect interface for delivering AI-supported information and other notifications. The other possibility is that smart glasses will replace bulky computer screens, acting instead as a private and portable monitor. But the companies pursuing these two approaches don\u2019t yet know which choice consumers will make or what applications they really want.</p><p>Smart-glasses skeptics will point to the fate of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/google-gets-in-your-face\" target=\"_self\">Google Glass</a>, which was introduced in 2012 and quickly became a prime example of a pricey technology in search of practical applications. It had little to offer consumers, aside from being an aspirational product that was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ar-glasses\" target=\"_self\">ostentatiously visible</a> to others. (Some rude users were even derided as \u201cglass-holes.\u201d) While Glass was a success in specialized applications <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/google-glass-gets-a-second-life-in-the-er\" target=\"_self\">such as surgery</a> and manufacturing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/15/google-discontinues-google-glass-enterprise-end-to-early-ar-project.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">until 2023</a>\u2014at least for those organizations that could afford to invest around a thousand dollars per pair\u2014it lacked any compelling application for the average consumer.</p><p>Smart-glasses technology may have improved since then, but the devices are still chasing a solid use case. From the tech behemoths to little brands you\u2019ve never heard of, the hardware once again is out over its skis, searching for the right application.</p><p>During <a href=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/META-Q4-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a Meta earnings call</a> in January, Mark Zuckerberg declared that 2025 \u201cwill be a defining year that determines if we\u2019re on a path toward many hundreds of millions and eventually billions\u201d of AI glasses. Part of that determination comes down to a choice of priorities: Should a head-worn display replicate the computer screens that we currently use, or should they work more like a smartwatch, which displays only limited amounts of information at a time?</p><h2>Virtual Reality vs. Augmented Reality</h2><p>Head-worn displays fall into two broad categories: those intended for virtual reality (VR) and those suited for augmented reality (AR). VR\u2019s more-immersive approach found some early success in the consumer market, such as the <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Quest 2</a> (originally released as the Oculus Quest 2 in 2020), which reportedly sold more than 20 million units before it was discontinued. According to the market research firm Counterpoint, however, the global market for VR devices <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/global-xr-arvr-headsets-market-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fell by 12 percent year over year</a> in 2024\u2014the third year of decline in a row\u2014because of hardware limitations and a lack of compelling use cases. As a mass consumer product, VR devices are probably past their moment.</p><p>In contrast, AR devices allow the wearer to stay engaged with their surroundings as additional information is overlaid in the field of view. In earlier generations of smart glasses, this information added context to the scene, such as travel directions or performance data for athletes. Now, with advances in generative AI, AR can answer questions and translate speech and text in real time.</p><p>Many analysts agree that AI-enhanced smart glasses are a market on the verge of massive growth. <a href=\"https://unanimous.ai/staff-item/louis-rosenberg-phd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Louis Rosenberg</a>, CEO and chief scientist with Unanimous AI, has been involved in AR technology from its start, more than 30 years ago. \u201cAI-powered smart glasses are the first mainstream XR [extended reality] devices that are profoundly useful and will achieve rapid adoption,\u201d Rosenberg told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>. \u201cThis, in turn, will accelerate the adoption of immersive versions to follow. In fact, I believe that within five years, immersive AI-powered glasses will replace the smartphone as the primary mobile device in our digital lives.\u201d</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/history-of-augmented-reality\" target=\"_self\">How a Parachute Accident Helped Jump-Start Augmented Reality</a></p><p>Major tech companies, including <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/android-xr-gemini-glasses-headsets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/apple-plans-glasses-for-2026-as-part-of-ai-push-nixes-watch-with-camera\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>, have announced their intentions to join this market, but have yet to ship a product.

Two of the most promising models\u2014the <a href=\"https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-one-pro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">One Pro</a> from Beijing-based <a href=\"https://www.xreal.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xreal</a> and the <a href=\"https://hallidayglobal.com/pages/halliday-glasses\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI glasses from Halliday</a>, based in Singapore\u2014represent the two different design concepts evolving in today\u2019s smart-glasses market.</p><h2>Halliday\u2019s \u201cHidden Superpower\u201d</h2><p>Halliday\u2019s smart glasses are a lightweight, inconspicuousdevice that looks like everydayeyewear. The glasses have a single small microLED projector placed above the right lens. This imager beams a monochrome green image directly to your eye, with a level of light dim enough to be safe but bright enough to be seen against ambient light. What the user sees is a virtual 3.5-inch (8.9-centimeter) screen in the upper right corner of their field of view. Like a typical smartwatch screen, it can display up to 10 or so short lines of text and basic graphics, such as arrows when showing turn-by-turn navigation instructions, sufficient to provide an interface for an AI companion.</p><p>In press materials, Halliday describes its glasses as \u201ca hidden superpower to tackle life\u2019s challenges.\u201d And hidden it is. The display technology is much more discreet than those of other designs that use waveguides or prismatic lenses, which will often reveal a reflected image or a noticeable rainbow effect. Because it projects the image directly to the eye, the Halliday device doesn\u2019t produce any such indications. The glasses can even be fitted with standard prescription lenses.</p><h2>Xreal\u2019s One Pro: The Full Picture</h2><p>By contrast, the Xreal One Pro has two separate imagers\u2014one for each eye\u2014that show full-color, 1,080-pixel images that fill 57 degrees of the user\u2019s field of view. This allows the One Pro to display the same content you\u2019d see on a notebook or desktop screen. (A more typical field of view for AR glasses is 30 to 45 degrees. Halliday\u2019s virtual screen occupies only a small portion of the user\u2019s field of view.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Conceptual rendering of the expanded layers comprising Xreal\\u2019s One Pro smart glasses. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"94d7d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/conceptual-rendering-of-the-expanded-layers-comprising-xreal-u2019s-one-pro-smart-glasses.jpg?id=62146864&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Xreal\u2019s One Pro smart glasses consist of many layers that work together to create a full-color, high-resolution display.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Xreal</small></p><p>In fact, the One Pro is intended to eliminate those notebook and desktop screens. \u201cWe\u2019re now at the point where AR glasses\u2019 spatial screens can truly replace physical monitors all day long,\u201d Xreal CEO and cofounder Chi Xu <a href=\"https://us.shop.xreal.com/blogs/news/xreal-one-series-launch-global-press-release\" target=\"_blank\">said in a December 2024 press release</a>. But it\u2019s not a solution for use when you\u2019re out and about; the glasses remain tethered to your computer or mobile device by a cable.</p><p>The glasses use microLED imagers that deliver good color and contrast performance, along with lower power consumption than an OLED. They also use a \u201cflat prism\u201d lens that is 11 millimeters thick\u2014less than half the thickness of the prisms in some other AR smart glasses, but three to four times as thick as typical prescription lenses.</p><p>The flat-prism technology is similar to the \u201cbird bath\u201d prisms in Xreal\u2019s previous glasses, which used a curved surface to reflect the display image to the wearer\u2019s eye, but the flat prism\u2019s thinner and lighter design offers a larger field of view. It also has advantages over the refraction-based waveguides used by other glasses, which can introduce visible artifacts such as colored halos.</p><p>In order to improve the visibility of the projected image, the glasses block much of the ambient light from the surroundings. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-guttag-a3b890\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Guttag</a>, a display-industry expert and author of the <a href=\"https://kguttag.com\" target=\"_blank\">KGOnTech blog</a>, says that the Xreal One Pro blocks about 78 percent of real-world light and are \u201clike dark sunglasses.\u201d</p><p>The One Pro also has a built-in spatial computer coprocessor, which enables the glasses to position an image relative to a direction in your view. For example, if you have an application that shows one set of information to your left, another in the middle, and a third to the right, you would simply turn your head to look at a different set. Or you could position an image in a fixed location\u2014as with the Halliday glasses\u2014so that it remains in front of you when you turn your head.</p><p>Having separate imagers for each eye makes it possible to create stereoscopic 3D effects. That means you could view a 3D object in a fixed location in your room, making for a more immersive experience.</p><h2>The Cost of More-Immersive AR</h2><p>All these features come at a cost. Xreal\u2019s glasses draw too much power to be run by battery, and they need a high-speed data connection to access the display data on a laptop or desktop computer. This connection provides power and enables high-resolution video streaming to the glasses, but it keeps the user tethered to the host device. The Halliday glasses, by contrast, run off a battery that the company states can last up to 12 hours between charges.</p><p>Another key difference is weight. Early AR glasses were so heavy that they were uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. The One Pro is relatively light at 87 grams, or a little less than the weight of a small smartphone. But the Halliday\u2019s simpler design and direct projector yields a device that\u2019s less than half that at 35 grams\u2014a weight similar to that of many regular prescription glasses.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Attendees trying new AI glasses at the Halliday booth during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5f336\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/attendees-trying-new-ai-glasses-at-the-halliday-booth-during-the-world-artificial-intelligence-conference.jpg?id=62146878&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Customers try out Halliday\u2019s smart glasses at an expo in China in July 2025. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ying Tang/NurPhoto/Getty Images</small></p><p>In both cases, this new generation of consumer-oriented smart glasses costs much less than enterprise AR systems, which cost several thousands of dollars. The One Pro lists for $649, while the Halliday lists for $499.</p><p>Currently, neither Halliday nor Xreal has a camera built into its glasses, which instead communicate through voice control and audio feedback. This eliminates extra weight and power consumption, helps keep costs down, and sidesteps the privacy concerns that proved to be one of the main sticking points for Google Glass.</p><p>There are certainly applications where a camera can be helpful, however, such as for image recognition or when users with impaired vision want to hear the text of signs read aloud. Xreal does offer an optional high-resolution camera module that mounts at the bridge of the nose. Whether to include a built-in camera in future models is yet another trade-off these companies will need to consider.</p><h2>What Do Consumers Really Want in Smart Glasses?</h2><p>Clearly, these two models of smart glasses represent very different design strategies and applications. The Halliday glasses exist largely as a mobile platform for an AI companion that you can use discretely throughout the day, the way you would use a smartwatch. The One Pro, on the other hand, can act as a replacement for your computer\u2019s monitor\u2014or several monitors, thanks to the spatial computing feature. The high resolution and full color deliver the same information that you\u2019re used to getting from the larger displays, with the trade-off that you\u2019re physically tethered to your computer.</p><p>Are either of these scenarios the killer app for smart glasses that we\u2019ve been waiting for?</p><p>With the rise of generative AI agents, people are growing increasingly comfortable with easy access to all sorts of information all the time. Smart speakers such as Amazon Echo have trained us to get answers to just about anything simply by asking. Wearing a device on your face that can discreetly present information on demand, like Halliday\u2019s glasses, will certainly appeal to some consumers, especially when it\u2019s priced affordably.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-chinnock-790646\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Chinnock</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.insightmedia.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Insight Media</a>, thinks this is the path for the future. \u201cI am not convinced that a display is needed for a lot of applications, or if you have a display, a small [field of view] version is sufficient. I think audio glasses coupled with AI capabilities could be very interesting in the near term, as the optics [or the] display for more full-featured AR glasses are developed.\u201d</p><p>On the other hand, many people may be seeking a compact and convenient alternative to the large, bulky external monitors that come with today\u2019s laptop and desktops. On an airplane, for instance, it\u2019s difficult to comfortably open your laptop screen enough to see it, and there\u2019s little expectation of privacy on a crowded flight. But with smart glasses that project multiple virtual screens, you may actually be able to do some useful work on a long flight.</p><p>For now, companies like Halliday and Xreal are hoping that there\u2019s room for both strategies in the consumer market. And with multiple choices now available at consumer-friendly prices, we will soon start to see how much interest there is. Will consumers choose the smart AI companion, or a compact and private replacement for computer screens? In either case, your glasses are likely to become a lot smarter.</p><table border=\"1\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;\">Model</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;\">Display technology</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;\">Number of displays</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;\">Resolution</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000;\">Price<br />(US $)</th></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><a href=\"https://hallidayglobal.com/products/halliday-glasses?srsltid=AfmBOorPVcssbyTd0k88T9FFfHSk920CBx6fR1lw-uX5BlmzdrlxEc3-\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Halliday</span></a></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Monochrome microLED</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Right <br />eye only</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Low</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>499</span></span></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><a href=\"https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-one-pro?srsltid=AfmBOooR9cz240ETCKfv6hsslYy4o0xFTab3nXcaJ7xXB8VJp1aR751P\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Xreal One Pro</span></a></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>Full-color microLED</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>Both eyes</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>High</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>649</span></span></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><a href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-and-neural-band/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Meta Ray-Ban Display</span></a></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Full-color liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS)</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Right <br />eye only</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>High</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>799</span></span></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span>TCL RayNeo X3 Pro</span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>Full color microLED</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>Both eyes</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>High</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>1,250</span></span></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><a href=\"https://www.evenrealities.com/g1\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Even Realities Even G1</span></a></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Monochrome microLED</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Both eyes</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>Low</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #DFD5C1;\"><span><span>599</span></span></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><a href=\"https://global.rokid.com/products/rokid-max-2-ar-glasses?srsltid=AfmBOop3WazN9rV_fnLC2XpVbNCJG9Rlcf36d7bccWvOD7EcRbUFC6vL\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Rokid Max 2</span></a></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>Full color micro-OLED</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>Both eyes</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>High</span></span></td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #E9E3D6;\"><span><span>529</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>"

It measures brain activity in two people in order to understand how their experiences compare and recreate one person\u2019s pain for the other. The platform was developed as a partnership between the large Tokyo-based telecommunications company <a href=\"https://www.docomo.ne.jp/english/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NTT Docomo</a> and startup <a href=\"https://pain-ml.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PaMeLa</a>, short for Pain Measurement Laboratory, in Osaka, Japan.</p><p>It\u2019s part of a project from Docomo called <a href=\"https://www.docomo.ne.jp/english/corporate/technology/rd/tech/6g/pdf/feel_tech_e.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feel Tech</a>. \u201cWe are developing a human-augmentation platform designed to deepen mutual understanding between people,\u201d a Docomo representative told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum </em><span></span></em>by email. (Answers were originally provided in Japanese and translated by Docomo\u2019s public relations.) \u201cPreviously, we focused on sharing movement, <a href=\"https://www.global.ntt/insights-hub/feel-tech-and-the-future-of-human-communication/\" target=\"_blank\">touch</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.docomo.ne.jp/info/news_release/2023/12/21_00.html?icid=CRP_CORP_technology_rd_ft_001_to_CRP_INFO_news_release_2023_12_21_00\" target=\"_blank\">taste</a>\u2014senses that are inherently difficult to express and communicate. This time, our focus is on pain, another sense that is challenging to articulate.\u201d </p><p>Docomo demonstrated the platform last month at the <a href=\"https://www.ceatec.com/en/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies </a>(CEATEC), Japan\u2019s largest electronics trade show.</p><h2>How Shared Pain Perception Tech Works</h2><p>The system consists of three components: a pain-sensing device, a platform for estimating the difference in sensitivity, and a heat-based actuation device. </p><p>First, the system uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain waves and uses an AI model to \u201cvisualize\u201d pain as a score between 0 and 100, for both the sender and receiver. The actuation device is then calibrated based on each person\u2019s sensitivity, so a sensation transmitted to both people will feel the same.</p><p>In this initial version, the platform works with thermally induced pain stimuli. \u201cThis method allows for precise adjustment and ensures safety during research and development,\u201d Docomo says. PaMeLa also used thermal stimulation in its research on determining the intensity level of pain, which graded the pain stimulation data of 461 subjects with machine learning algorithms. </p><p><span>However, the company says, pain from other sources can also be shared. Eventually, Docomo aims to convey many types of physical and even psychological pain, which will be an aim of future research. </span><span>\u201cWe believe there are various possibilities for how pain can be captured and shared,\u201d Docomo says.</span></p><h2>Finding a Use Case for Shared Pain Perception</h2><p>The technology is still at a very early stage, says <a href=\"https://www.lerner.ccf.org/biomedical-engineering/saab/\" target=\"_blank\">Carl Saab</a>, the founder and director of the <a href=\"https://www.lerner.ccf.org/consortium-for-pain/\" target=\"_blank\">Cleveland Clinic Consortium for Pain</a>. Saab, who is also an adjunct professor at Brown University, researches pain biomarkers, including through EEG measurements and AI. </p><p>For one thing, Saab says he\u2019s not clear what the use case is for the platform. In terms of the science, h<span>e also notes that pain differs in healthy patients and those experiencing ongoing pain, such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chronic-pain\" target=\"_blank\">chronic pain</a> or migraine. \u201cIf you induce pain in a healthy volunteer versus somebody who\u2019s a pain patient, the nature of the representation of pain in the brain is different,\u201d Saab says. Healthy volunteers know that the pain will be temporary, he explains. But in real patients, chronic pain often comes with anxiety, depression, and sometime side effects from medication.</span></p><p>In a study Saab conducted several years ago, for example, he induced pain by submerging volunteers\u2019 arms in ice for an extended period. When he did the same with pain patients, the resulting brain activity was much more complex, and the signals weren\u2019t so clear. </p><p>Docomo says it plans to collaborate with hospitals in the future to verify the technology in medical settings. And in March, PaMeLa <a href=\"https://pain-ml.com/en/2025/03/31/completion-of-investigator-initiated-clinical-trial-for-the-development-of-the-pain-assessment-support-system-pms-2/\" target=\"_blank\">announced it completed</a> a clinical trial that analyzed changes in EEG signals before and after administration of painkillers in patients receiving surgeries under general anesthesia. The startup is also investigating pain in other conditions, such as exercise, acute pain from injections, and chronic pain.</p><p>\u201cPain is a multidimensional experience,\u201d Saab says. \u201cWhen you say you\u2019re measuring someone\u2019s pain, you always have to be careful about what kind of dimension you are measuring.\u201d</p>"
