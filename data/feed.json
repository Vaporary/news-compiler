        "summary": "Is human-caused climate change likely to trigger enduring economic decline in modern societies? We study whether changes in violent conflict and economic growth caused by warming could interact to degrade economic opportunities and trap African countries in poverty. We provide evidence of an emerging high-conflict and low-growth \"poverty trap\" equilibrium in Africa and describe theoretically how such an equilibrium could result from warming. We then combine historical data on temperature, growth, and conflict with projections from a large ensemble of global climate models to evaluate the risk that warming and subsequent conflict could push African economies into a regime of sustained negative economic growth. We find that the risk of such \"economic collapse\" is material in a moderate-to-high emissions scenario. We estimate that in Africa, a current \"high\" emissions trajectory (RCP 7.0) may increase the incidence of conflict 5.1 percentage points (95% CI 0.2-13.0) and increase the share of countries with net negative GDP growth this century by 12.2 percentage points (95% CI 2.0-27.5).  We calculate that roughly 82% of this additional conflict risk and 14% of projected GDP losses are due to the interacting effects between these two outcomes, underscoring the importance of accounting for their indirect effects and feedbacks. Our findings suggest an unprecedented scale of emissions mitigation, economic policy innovation or institutional investment that would be required to contain the risk of catastrophic human impacts from climate change in many African countries."

        "summary": "Immunotherapy is a breakthrough innovation in cancer care but is also among the most expensive treatments, with costs exceeding $150,000 per patient. We study the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the most widely used class of immunotherapy drugs. In 2022, ICIs accounted for 44% of the $17.5 billion Medicare Part B cancer drug spending. We focus on metastatic melanoma, the first approved indication for ICIs. While overall cancer mortality rates declined since the 1990s, melanoma mortality rates increased through the early 2010s. Following the first ICI approvals in 2011 and 2014, melanoma mortality declined sharply. Using traditional Medicare claims, we estimate the impact of the introduction of ICIs on healthcare utilization, costs, and 1-year survival for patients with metastatic melanoma, relative to metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), where ICIs were not approved until 2017. Variation in approval timing allows us to isolate the effect of ICIs from broader cancer care trends. We find that ICIs reduced 1-year mortality by 6.2%. Since about 1 in 5 metastatic melanoma patients received ICIs, this implies a 27.5% reduction among treated patients. The introduction of ICIs also reduced chemotherapy and radiation use, but increased Medicare spending by 59.3% or about 260% among ICI-treated patients. Accounting for life expectancy gains beyond one year, the benefits of ICIs for melanoma patients appear comparable, or potentially even greater, than the substantial added Medicare costs. Nonetheless, ICI use remains relatively low given large survival benefits and few alternative treatments, suggesting that costs\nand other barriers limit patient access."

While the 2025 System of National Accounts introduces AI as a distinct asset, challenges remain in valuing AI-related investments, inputs, and outputs. Moreover, as a general-purpose technology, AI alters business processes, service quality, and labor organization in ways poorly reflected in official data. This paper outlines key measurement gaps from transformative AI, including the tracking cross-border inputs, quality change, and process changes. We argue that economic statistics should adopt more granular, task-based, and outcome-focused approaches to ensure relevance in an increasingly AI-driven economy."

I concluded with a discussion of vertical policies relevant for LMICs\u2014particularly the role of services\u2014and suggest areas where further research is needed to assess whether development can be service-led."

We study the effect of fractional ownership on the licensing of copyrighted material and its reuse. To do so, we compile new data on the copyright ownership structure of songs and their licensing for use in movies. We document that fractional song ownership has increased substantially: the mean number of songwriters and publishers per song has tripled between 1958 and 2021. We show that, conditional on a rich set of controls, greater fractionalization is associated with lower likelihood of licensing. We leverage the Sony-led acquisition of EMI Music Publishing in 2012 to obtain within-song variation in ownership and find that consolidating ownership rights significantly increases licensing, beyond any standalone effects of the merger."

        "summary": "We explore the evolving significance of different production sectors within the U.S. economy since World War II and provide methods for estimating and forecasting these shifts. Using a compositional accounting approach, we find that the well-documented transition from goods to services is primarily driven by two compositional changes: 1) the rise of Intellectual Property Products (IPP) as an input producer, replacing Durable Goods almost one-for-one in terms of input shares in virtually all sectors; and 2) a shift in consumer spending from Nondurable Goods to Services. A structural model replicating these shifts reveals that the rise of IPP at the expense of Durable Goods is largely explained by increases in the efficiency of IPP inputs used in production: input-biased technical change. Trend variations in sectoral total factor productivity, and their attendant effects on relative prices and income, are the main driver of evolving consumption patterns. Both reduced-form and structural forecasts project these trends to continue over the next two decades, albeit at lower rates, indicating a slower pace of structural change."

He said Taiwan might consider advanced nuclear options if technology improves, waste decreases, and public support grows. <strong></strong></p><p>In late August, the government approved a draft piece of legislation, <a href=\"https://www.ey.gov.tw/File/E3D2460979E0685?A=C\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the AI Basic Act</a>, designed to create a supportive environment for AI development and use. The draft emphasizes the government\u2019s role in promoting AI research, applications, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the newly reshuffled Cabinet is under pressure by industry and the broader public to maintain energy security.<br /><br />In mid-September, newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs <a href=\"https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/EconomicChief/EconomicChief.aspx?code=E&amp;kind=01&amp;work=Y&amp;menu_id=32895\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-hsin Kung</a> emphasized that Taiwan is a global hub for chips and technology, shaping strategies for the next 10 to 20 years.</p><h2>Taiwan\u2019s Renewable Energy Goals</h2><p>Kung stressed that businesses require both <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?t=1466&amp;v=IeXR0V3Ukbo&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stable power supply and green energy</a> to meet commitments to 100 percent renewable energy from global corporate initiative <a href=\"https://www.there100.org/about-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RE110</a>.<strong> </strong>He said the new Cabinet will continue focusing on renewable energy while adjusting rollout speed.

Offshore wind construction will be accelerated, and a trial program for floating wind turbines will resume. Taiwan will also actively develop other green energy sources, such as geothermal and hydrogen.<br /><br />On nuclear, Kung reaffirmed Taiwan\u2019s nuclear-free path but left open the possibility of adopting advanced technologies like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states\" target=\"_self\">small modular reactors</a>. Guidelines for evaluating potential restarts of existing plants will be released by the end of October. The first step will see the Taiwan Power Co.

Maanshan, which began commercial operations in 1984, is regarded as the most likely to pass the safety self-assessments, which will focus on the ability to maintain aging equipment and upgrade earthquake resilience.<br /><br />In a report released on 26 September, Taiwan\u2019s Energy Administration projects electricity demand to <a href=\"https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/Populace/news/News.aspx?kind=1&amp;menu_id=40&amp;news_id=120573\" target=\"_blank\">grow 1.7 percent annually</a> from 2025 to 2034.

She acknowledges that not all women have the same support system she has\u2014which is part of the reason why she is dedicated to helping others succeed.</p><h2>A passion for teaching</h2><p>Thomas was born and raised in Kerala, India. Kerala students who excelled at school were expected to choose a career in either medicine or engineering, she says. Medicine wasn\u2019t an option for her, she says, because she faints at the sight of blood. She was good at mathematics, though, so she chose to pursue engineering.</p><p>Although both her parents were teachers (her father taught chemistry; her mother was a language instructor), she wasn\u2019t inspired to pursue a similar path until she was an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://keralauniversity.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Kerala</a>. Her extensive note-taking during class made her popular among her classmates, she says, and some would ask her to tutor them during exam season.</p><p>\u201cMy friends would come over to my home so I could explain the material to them using my notes,\u201d she says. \u201cAfterward, they would tell me that they were able to understand the subject much better than how the professor had explained it. That\u2019s what inspired me to become a teacher.\u201d</p><p>After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1984, Thomas continued her education at the <a href=\"https://www.iitm.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>. Shortly after earning her master\u2019s of technology in electrical engineering in 1986, she began her first teaching job at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, also in Kerala.</p><p>The year was a whirlwind for Thomas, who got married, left her job, and moved to New Delhi, where her husband lived. Instead of searching for another teaching job, she decided to pursue a doctoral degree in the electrical engineering program at the <a href=\"https://www.iitd.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi</a>.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I was 28, I had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which I earned in 1990,\u201d she says. \u201cI soon got a job at Delhi Technological University, the only other college in New Delhi that had an engineering school at that time, other than IIT. From there, I never looked back.\u201d</p><p>She taught at the university for five years, then left in 1995 to join Jamia Millia Islamia. She eventually was promoted to lead the electrical engineering department.</p><p>During her 11 years there, she established labs to conduct research in supervisory control and data acquisition (<a href=\"https://inductiveautomation.com/resources/article/what-is-scada\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SCADA</a>) and substation automation, collaborating with industry on projects. In 2003 she created a curriculum for\u2014and led the launch of\u2014a master\u2019s of technology program in electrical power system management as well as a training program for industry professionals. For her work, she received a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/awards/meritorious-award\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities Board Meritorious Achievement Award</a>.</p><p>In 2014 she founded the school\u2019s <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/cie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a> to help startups turn their ideas into prototypes and launch businesses.</p><p>She received an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse in 2016: become president of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli.</p><p>\u201cThis was a great honor to become the first woman president of that institute,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the only woman among 90 presidents of all the institutions of national importance at that time.\u201d</p><p>But, she says, as president, she didn\u2019t have much time to teach, and after five years, she began to miss her time in the classroom. After her five-year term was completed, she returned to Jamia Millia Islamia in 2021 as engineering dean. Since then, she has led the launch of five programs: three undergraduate programs (in data science, electrical and computer engineering, and VLSI) and graduate programs in data science and environmental sciences.</p><p>This year she stepped down after completing her three-year term as dean and is focusing more on teaching.</p><p>She teaches at least one class each semester because, she says, she finds joy in \u201cimparting and giving knowledge to young minds.\u201d</p><h2>Mentoring women in the power industry</h2><p>Thomas mentors doctoral students as well as professors who aspire to serve as deans or other high-level positions.</p><p>In addition, she trains mid-career women in the power industry on the skills they need to get promoted\u2014to technical and senior management roles\u2014through the <a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/the-wepowernetwork.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">South Asia WePOWER network</a>\u2019s South Asia Region (SAR) 100 professional development program.

Thomas is one of 40 experts who remotely teach topics such as transmission details, distribution, renewable energy, and the importance of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-updates-2025\" target=\"_self\">women in leadership</a>.</p><p>She also mentors women to give them confidence and tools to reach leadership positions because \u201cmentorship is what changed my career trajectory,\u201d she says. When she first began teaching, she says she was reluctant to take high-level positions. But after participating in a six-day leadership training at the <a href=\"https://www.jnu.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a>, which was hosted by the Government of India\u2019s <a href=\"https://ugc.gov.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University Grants Commission</a>, she felt confident in her ability to move up the career ladder.</p><p>\u201cMany women take a break from their careers to raise their children, struggle to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/work-life-balance\" target=\"_self\">balance their personal and professional lives</a>, or don\u2019t have a support system,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to impart the lessons I learned from my experiences and the training I received. Whenever I get a chance, I get involved.\u201d</p><h2>Creating lifelong friendships and mentoring students</h2><p>Thomas joined IEEE in 1990 as a graduate student member and says she continues renewing her membership to stay up to date on emerging technologies, specifically SCADA systems.</p><p>\u201cI learned everything about SCADA from a tutorial developed by the <a href=\"https://ieee-pes.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Power & Energy Society</a>. There was no such material available at that time,\u201d she says.</p><p>Years later, in 2015, Thomas cowrote <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/power-system-scada-and-smart-grids-mini-s-thomas/1133718207\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Power System SCADA and Smart Grids</em></em></a> with her friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndougmcdonald\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John McDonald</a>, whom she met through the organization. McDonald is an IEEE Life Fellow and the founder and CEO of JDM Associates in Duluth, Ga.</p><p>Thomas became an active volunteer for the <a href=\"https://www.ieeedtu.in/IEEEDTU/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delhi Technological University\u2019s student branch</a>, where she helped organize technical talks and other events. When Thomas joined Jamia Millia Islamia, she revived the inactive <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/company/ieeejmi-sb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">student branch</a> there and served as its counselor for 14 years.</p><p>During her 35 years with IEEE, she has served as chair of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities/regional-list-region-10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Region 10</a> student activities committee and vice chair of membership development for <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities</a>. She was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/eab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities</a> and the <a href=\"https://pspb.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Publication Services and Products</a> boards.</p><p>\u201cCreating programs that benefit members makes me feel satisfied,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cVolunteering has also boosted my confidence.\u201d</p><p>She is also a member of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a>\u2019s editorial advisory board.</p><p>Not only does she attribute much of her professional growth to the organization, she also has created lifelong friendships through IEEE, she says. One friend is 2023 IEEE President <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/saifur-rahman-a\" target=\"_self\">Saifur Rahman</a>, whom she met in 2000 when he spoke to the Jamia Millia Islamia student branch.</p><p>\u201cOur friendship has grown so much that Saifur is like family,\u201d she says.</p><p>When Rahman launched the IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization in 2022, he asked Thomas to become a member. She helped create the <a href=\"https://innovate.ieee.org/the-ieee-climate-change-collection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Climate Change Collection</a> on the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Xplore</a> Digital Library. The following year, she led the development of a climate change taxonomy. The 620 words are included in the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Thesaurus</a>, which defines almost 12,500 engineering, technical, and scientific terms. Now she is working with a team to expand the taxonomy by defining hundreds more climate-change terms.</p><p>\u201cYou should always do what you enjoy. For me, that\u2019s teaching and volunteering with IEEE,\u201d she says. \u201cI could just be a member, access the technical content, and be happy with just that, but I volunteer because I can do things that help others.\u201d</p>"

According to AI21, this smarter routing could dramatically cut AI infrastructure costs for certain workloads\u2014potentially by an order of magnitude.</p><h2>A Small but Mighty LLM</h2><p>With 3 billion parameters, Jamba Reasoning 3B is tiny by today\u2019s AI standards. Models like GPT-5 or Claude run well past 100 billion parameters, and even smaller models, such as Llama 3 (8B) or Mistral (7B), are more than twice the size of AI21\u2019s model, Goshen notes.</p><p>That compact size makes it more remarkable that AI21\u2019s model can handle a context window of 250,000 tokens on consumer devices. <span>Some proprietary models, like GPT-5, offer even longer context windows, but Jamba sets a new high-water mark among open-source models. The previous open-model</span><span> record of 128,000 tokens </span><span>was held by </span><span>Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2 (3B), Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 Mini, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepseek\" target=\"_blank\">DeepSeek R1</a>, which are all much larger models. </span><span>Jamba Reasoning 3B can process more than 17 tokens per second even when working at full capacity</span><span>\u2014that is, with</span><span> extremely long inputs that use its full 250,000-token context window. Many other models slow down or struggle once their input length exceeds 100,000 tokens.</span></p><p>Goshen explains that the model is built on an architecture called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887\" target=\"_blank\">Jamba</a>, which combines two types of neural network designs: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a> layers, familiar from other large language models, and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mamba-model\" target=\"_blank\">Mamba</a> layers, which are designed to be more memory-efficient. This hybrid design enables the model to handle long documents, large codebases, and other extensive inputs directly on a laptop or phone\u2014using about one-tenth the memory of traditional transformers. Goshen says the model runs much faster than traditional transformers because it relies less on a memory component called the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249\" target=\"_blank\">KV cache</a>, which can slow down processing as inputs get longer. </p><h2>Why Small LLMs Are Needed</h2><p>The model\u2019s hybrid architecture gives it an advantage in both speed and memory efficiency, even with very long inputs, confirms a software engineer who works in the LLM industry. The engineer requested anonymity because they\u2019re not authorized to comment on other companies\u2019 models. <span>As more users run generative AI locally on laptops, models need to handle long context lengths quickly without consuming too much memory. At 3 billion parameters, Jamba meets these requirements, says the engineer, making it a model that\u2019s optimized for on-device use.</span></p><p>Jamba Reasoning 3B is open source under the permissive <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 license</a> and available on popular platforms such as <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugging Face</a> and <a href=\"https://lmstudio.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">LM Studio</a>. The release also comes with instructions for fine-tuning the model through an open-source reinforcement-learning platform (called <a href=\"https://github.com/volcengine/verl\" target=\"_blank\">VERL</a>), making it easier and more affordable for developers to adapt the model for their own tasks.</p><p>\u201cJamba Reasoning 3B marks the beginning of a family of small, efficient reasoning models,\u201d Goshen said. \u201cScaling down enables decentralization, personalization, and cost efficiency. Instead of relying on expensive GPUs in data centers, individuals and enterprises can run their own models on devices. That unlocks new economics and broader accessibility.\u201d</p>"

Then a pattern is made, the fabric is chosen and cut, and the garment is sewed. Finally the clothing is packaged and shipped.</p><p>To expedite the process, some apparel companies now use 3D technologies including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/augmented-reality-consumers-customize-products\" target=\"_self\">design software</a>, <a href=\"https://sagroups.ieee.org/ic15-004/home/ic-groups/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">body scans</a>, visualization, and 3D <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printing-smart-objects\" target=\"_self\">printers</a>. The tools allow designers to envision their creations in a variety of colors, fabrics, and motifs. Avatars known as <em><em>digital twins</em></em> are created to simulate how the clothes will look and fit on different body types. Body scans generate measurements for better-fitting clothing and improved product design.</p><p>Some manufacturers incorporate artificial intelligence to streamline operations, and additional companies likely will explore it as it becomes more accurate.</p><p>Not all garment makers are utilizing 3D technologies to their fullest potential, however.</p><p>To advance 3D technology for designers, manufacturers, and retailers, the <a href=\"https://3drc.pi.tv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3D Retail Coalition</a> holds an annual challenge that spotlights academic institutions and startups that are leading the way.

The New York City school offers programs in design, fashion, art, communications, and business.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pixascale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PixaScale</a> won the startup category. Based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, the consultancy assists fashion and consumer goods companies with automating content, managing 3D digital assets, and improving workflows.</p><h2>Custom-made clothing by 3D and AI</h2><p>Ill-fitting garments, shoes, and accessories are problems for clothing companies. The average <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/media/clothing-return-rates-by-category-and-country-csf-a/#:~:text=Global%20Overview,in%20the%20region%20at%2022%2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">return rate worldwide for clothing ordered online is more than 25 percent</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PrimeAI</a>.</p><p>To make ready-to-wear clothing, designers use grading, a process that takes an initial sample pattern of a base size using established standards and 3D body scans, then makes smaller and larger versions to be mass-produced. But the resulting clothes do not fit everyone.</p><p>Returns, which can be frustrating for shoppers, are costly for clothing companies due to reshipping and restocking expenses.</p><p>Some customers can\u2019t be bothered to send back unwanted items, and they throw them in the garbage, where they end up in landfills.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we could go back to the days when you would go to a shop, get measured, and someone would custom-make your garment?\u201d posits <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-lavange-b0358a15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh LaVange</a>, an assistant professor of technical design and patternmaking at FIT.</p><p>That was the idea behind LaVange\u2019s winning project, Automated Custom Sizing. Her proposal uses 3D technology and AI to produce custom-tailored clothing on demand for all body types. She outlined short- and long-term scalable solutions in her submission.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d <strong>\u2014Leigh LaVange</strong></p><p>\u201cI see it [custom sizing] as a solution that can be automated and eventually rolled out across all different types of brands,\u201d she says.</p><p>The short-term proposal involves measuring a person\u2019s base body specifications, such as bust, waist, thighs, biceps, and hips\u2014either manually or from a 3D body scan. An avatar of the customer is then created and entered into a database preloaded with 3D representations of various sizes of the sample garment. The AI program notes the customer\u2019s specs and the existing sizes to determine the best fit. If, for example, the person\u2019s chest matches the medium-size dimensions but the hips are a few millimeters larger, the program still might recommend medium because it determined the material around the hips had enough excess fabric. A rendering of an avatar wearing an item is shown to customers to help them decide whether to make the purchase.</p><p>LaVange says her solution will help improve customer satisfaction and minimize returns.</p><p>Her long-term plan is a truly customized fit. Using 3D body scans, an AI program would determine the necessary adjustments to the pattern based on the customer\u2019s specifications and critical fit points, like the waist, while preserving the original design. The 3D system then would make alterations, which would be rendered on the customer\u2019s avatar for approval. The solution would eliminate excess inventory, LaVange says, because the clothing would be custom-made.</p><p>Because her proposals rely on technologies not currently used by the industry and a different way of interacting with customers, a shift in production would be required, she says.</p><p>\u201cMost manufacturing systems today are set up to produce as many units as possible in a single day,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a way to produce garments efficiently if you set up your manufacturing facility correctly. I want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d</p><h2>A digital asset management platform</h2><p>The winning submission in the startup category, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhl20Qr4Ss\" target=\"_blank\">AI-First DAM [digital asset management] as an Intelligent Backbone for Agile Product Development</a>, uses 3D technology and AI to combine components of clothing design into a centralized platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristian-sons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kristian Sons</a>, chief executive of Pixascale, launched the startup in February. He left <a href=\"https://www.adidas.com/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adidas</a> in January after nine years at the company, where he was the technical lead for digital creation.</p><p>Many apparel companies, Sons says, still store their 3D files on employees\u2019 local drives or on Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint</a>, a Web-based document-management system.</p><p>Those methods make things difficult because not everyone has access.</p><p>Sons\u2019 cloud-based platform addresses the issue by sharing digital assets, such as images, videos, 3D models, base styles, and documents, to all parties involved in the process.</p><p>That includes designers, seamstresses, and manufacturers. His system integrates with the client\u2019s file management system, providing access to the most recent images, renderings, and other relevant data.</p><p>His DAM system also includes a library of embellishments such as zippers and buttons, as well as fabric options.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and can understand what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration.\u201d <strong>\u2014Kristian Sons</strong></p><p>\u201cGetting this information into a platform that everyone can easily access and track what others did really builds a foundation for collaboration,\u201d he says.</p><p>Sons also is working on incorporating <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-economy\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> and large language models to connect with internal systems and application programming interfaces to autonomously conduct simple research requests.</p><p>That might include suggesting new products or different silhouettes, or modifying the previous season\u2019s offerings with new colors, Sons says.</p><p>\u201cThese AI agents certainly will not be perfect, but they are a good starting point so designers don\u2019t have to start from scratch,\u201d he says. \u201cI think using AI agents is super exciting because in the past few years in the fashion industry, we have been talking about how AI would do the creative parts, like designing a product.

A senior studying biomedical engineering at the<a href=\"https://www.uanl.mx/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n</a> (UANL), in Monterrey, Mexico, she is the founding chair of her school\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.embs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</a> (EMBS) student branch. The student member\u2019s research interests in<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neuroscience\" target=\"_self\"> neuroengineering</a> and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> artificial intelligence</a> are shaping her vision for the future of health care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about technology and health,\u201d she says. \u201cBiomedical engineering is giving me a way to combine these two worlds and work on solutions that make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>Her growing influence in<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE</a> coupled with her academic achievements signal a promising, influential career.</p><h2>From chemistry to caring </h2><p>Ramirez was born in<a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/676/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Zacatecas, Mexico</a>, known for its silver mines, agriculture, and strong cultural pride. From a young age, she loved science\u2014particularly chemistry\u2014and thrived in schools designated for advanced learners.</p><p>Her first exposure to the health care field came during high school, when she trained as a nursing technician. Her high school curriculum was organized as a co-op program, which included traditional classes alternating with internships in nursing. Ramirez interned at the <a href=\"https://www.medicina.uanl.mx/hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez</a> in Monterrey, Mexico.</p><p>Alternating between the academic and vocational tracks allowed her to graduate with a diploma and a technical degree at the same time. Speaking of her early experiences, she says, \u201cI saw how many patients struggled, not just with their conditions but also with the logistics of seeking and coordinating treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat made me want to work at the intersection of medicine and innovation.\u201d</p><p>With her father working as a materials engineer and her mother as an accountant, she grew up in a household where technical problem-solving and analytical thinking were part of daily life.</p><p>That blend of influences reinforced her decision to pursue engineering as a career rather than the medical field, she says.</p><h2>Exploring neuroengineering and AI</h2><p>Since beginning her studies at UANL in 2021, Ramirez has focused on neuroengineering, one of three specializations the school offers. She has explored the role artificial intelligence plays in diagnosing and treating conditions including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alzheimers-disease\" target=\"_self\"> Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\"> </a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression\" target=\"_self\">depression</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\">, epilepsy</a>, and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/schizophrenia\" target=\"_self\"> schizophrenia</a>.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_self\">IEEE mentoring program</a>, she received guidance from global experts including a doctor from India who helped refine her early AI projects.</p><p>Her work quickly evolved from class assignments to projects with real-world potential.</p><p>\u201cThe project I\u2019m most excited about has not been published, but it mainly consisted of using convolutional neural networks in medical image processing (MRI) and machine learning in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases,\u201d she says.</p><p>This year she broadened her scope by attending the IEEE<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Conference on Robotics and Automation</a> in Atlanta, where she gained exposure to both industrial and academic applications of robotics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick.

She contributes to improving the patient experience in hospitals across Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.</p><p>\u201cI design projects aimed at improving the quality of care and making the hospital intervention more effective for patients across different stages: prevention/wellness, diagnosis, hospitalization, rehabilitation, and post-discharge follow-up,\u201d She declined to provide specific examples, citing medical confidentiality agreements.</p><p>\u201cMy internship is about finding ways to make health care not just effective but also more humane,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about improving processes so patients feel cared for\u2014from the moment they enter the hospital until they leave.\u201d</p><h2>Finding leadership and purpose in IEEE</h2><p>Ramirez founded the IEEE EMBS student branch in 2023. As chair, she represents the branch at <a href=\"https://r9.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Region 9</a> meetings, where she advocates for mentorship opportunities and collaboration with other IEEE groups.</p><p>Through her involvement, she says, she has gained not only technical knowledge but also critical soft skills in leadership, time management, and teamwork.</p><p>\u201cIEEE taught me how to lead with empathy and how to work with people from different backgrounds,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has expanded my vision beyond Mexico, showing me challenges and innovations happening all over the world.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree abroad\u2014potentially in public health or AI for medical devices\u2014and ultimately a Ph.D. Her long-term goal is to launch a business focused on developing health care innovations, specifically in disease prevention.</p><h2>A future built on innovation</h2><p>For Ramirez, improving health care means more than developing cutting-edge technology. It also involves rethinking how people understand and manage their own health.</p><p>\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Her vision is as ambitious as it is personal, rooted in her own journey from Zacatecas to Monterrey and beyond.</p><p>As her career advances, she says, she intends to keep IEEE at the center of her professional life.</p><p>\u201cIn IEEE I\u2019ve found a community that challenges me to grow, supports me when I fail, and celebrates when I succeed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about engineering; it\u2019s about building a better future, together.\u201d</p>"

Naively, it appears that Cursor is making a meaningful percentage of coders obsolete.</p><p>This begs the question: Is it even worth learning to code anymore? </p><p>The answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The above fear-based analysis of Cursor misses several important points.</p><p>First, the demand for software is insatiable. Getting a computer to follow our instructions properly (i.e., coding) is economically incredibly valuable. However, for decades now, the number of people with the specialized skill to communicate with computers has been limited. If AI tools let us write more functional code, many more people, companies, and industries will benefit. As Marc Andreesen famously alluded to in his 2011 essay \u201c<a href=\"https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">Why Software Is Eating the World</a>,\u201d the demand for software is elastic. As software becomes cheaper, we see a disproportionately large increase in demand. </p><p>There\u2019s no such thing as finishing a software project. Humans are very good at demanding more products and services, and software will inevitably play a role in that future.</p><p>Another critical observation is that AI-assisted code is simply a continuation of the evolution of software development. In the 1970s, we used to program with punch cards. Then we started writing low-level code with a keyboard. Then we shifted to higher-level languages. Each successive era saw large increases in the number of software engineers while simultaneously improving the productivity of each person. We\u2019ve seen this storyline before: AI is just another tool to give us superpowers.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-ai-coding-tools\" target=\"_self\">Coding tools</a> like Cursor or Devin are less about replacing software engineers than they are about increasing the number of software engineers. Going forward, writing code won\u2019t be restricted to those with a particular title; everyone including lawyers, accountants, and doctors will develop software. Cursor won\u2019t replace the 25 million software engineers we have today.

It will be copper.</p><p>The world is building AI like it\u2019s Minecraft, stacking <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers\" target=\"_blank\">data centers</a>, transmission lines, and cooling systems with little regard for the physical limits beneath them. Everyone is focused on models and computation, but few acknowledge the metal that makes them run.</p><p>Every piece of modern electrical infrastructure\u2014not just AI\u2014depends on copper. AI data centers are simply accelerating demand. One hyperscale facility can require tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. For example, one Microsoft data center <a href=\"https://www.bhp.com/news/bhp-insights/2025/01/why-ai-tools-and-data-centres-are-driving-copper-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">used over 2,000 tonnes</a>, or 27 tonnes per megawatt. A McKinsey report predicts that overall transmission build-out could push annual global copper demand up to about <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/bridging-the-copper-supply-gap\" target=\"_blank\">37 million tonnes by 2031</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-mining\" target=\"_blank\">Accessible copper is running out</a>. More than 70 percent of global reserves are locked in ores that conventional mining struggles to process efficiently. Tens of billions of tons sit idle in waste piles and marginal deposits, overlooked by industry but still rich with potential.</p><p>That potential is what drew me here. As a geoscientist who later worked in energy and cloud infrastructure, I saw firsthand the growing need for copper\u2014and realized I had the knowledge to help address it. In 2023, I founded a startup called <a href=\"https://www.endolithmining.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Endolith</a> to recover copper from these forgotten sources. The tool is not drills or dynamite. It\u2019s microbes.</p><h2>How microbial mining works</h2><p>These microbes are naturally evolved, field-deployable, and highly effective at <a href=\"https://www.endolithmining.com/technology#copper\" target=\"_blank\">recovering copper</a> from complex ores such as chalcopyrite and enargite. They thrive in leaching heaps under real-world conditions, working with real customers. And the bonus: They use less energy, deliver more copper, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional methods.</p><p>And what are those traditional methods? Typically, mines extract copper from ores by grinding the rock, concentrating the ore, and then using high-temperature smelting or chemical leaching with strong acids. Both approaches are energy-intensive, slow to unlock copper, and leave behind large volumes of waste and emissions.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A researcher in a lab coat, safety glasses, and purple gloves holds a long pointed device up to a petri dish with a translucent material in it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b9a19\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-researcher-in-a-lab-coat-safety-glasses-and-purple-gloves-holds-a-long-pointed-device-up-to-a-petri-dish-with-a-translucent.jpg?id=61716661&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Endolith researchers use machine learning to determine which microbes to deploy at a given site and how to adjust the mix over time. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dynamic Tech Media/Endolith</small></p><p>In contrast, our \u201cmicrobial minions\u201d work by accelerating the natural process of <a href=\"https://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/innovations/2004/05/producing_copper_natures_way_bioleaching.html\" target=\"_blank\">bioleaching</a>. Instead of relying on smelting or harsh acids, Endolith\u2019s microbes attach to the ore and pull out the copper faster. They adapt to the chemistry of different rock types, recover more metal, and do it with lower energy use and less environmental impact.</p><p>To make this possible, we rely on machine learning. Genomic and metabolic data from thousands of microbes are modeled to predict which strains can survive in extreme ores such as chalcopyrite or enargite, and how they will perform under different environmental conditions. These models guide which microbial communities are deployed, how they are tuned for each site, and how they adapt over time. In effect, AI is what turns biology from trial-and-error into a scalable system for copper recovery; in turn, that copper is what keeps powering the growth of AI itself.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An overhead shot shows two workers in lab coats and hard hats pointing up at a series of tall columns sheathed in foil\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"98b46\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-overhead-shot-shows-two-workers-in-lab-coats-and-hard-hats-pointing-up-at-a-series-of-tall-columns-sheathed-in-foil.jpg?id=61716658&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Endolith is currently running a pilot project in Arvada, Colorado.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dynamic Tech Media/Endolith</small></p><p>Our approach has already been validated by some of the largest copper producers in the world, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/press-releases/endolith-achieves-breakthrough-in-critical-mineral-extraction-2025-05-13/\" target=\"_blank\">including BHP</a>. Microbial recovery is cleaner. It scales. It adapts. Our modular biohatcheries\u2014field units designed to grow and deliver tailored microbes\u2014can be deployed in days. They can be tuned for local conditions. They make copper recovery viable on deposits that were previously left untouched. This tool opens access to a part of the supply chain that mining has overlooked and technology has rarely considered.</p><h2>The copper crunch is slowing down AI</h2><p>Conversations about AI infrastructure rarely address this layer.

Its presence becomes obvious when a data center project is delayed because a transformer cannot be delivered on time, or when utilities cannot build transmission lines quickly enough to support new computing loads. These are copper problems, hiding in plain sight.</p><p>I have had calls with site engineers who are excited about deploying cutting-edge computing, but are quietly worried about whether the wiring can handle it. Infrastructure does not automatically follow because the software is ready. Copper is bound by geology and time. Mines move slowly, recycling moves too narrowly, and demand moves too fast. Smarter biological recovery is the lever we can pull today.</p><p><span>Skeptics note that bioleaching has historically struggled with tough ores like <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892687523004314\" target=\"_blank\">chalcopyrite</a>. Processes were often slow, incomplete, or difficult to manage at scale. Recent advances in microbial science and heap engineering are closing those gaps. With AI guiding the optimization of microbes, we can now match the right strains to the right ores, showing that biology can succeed where older methods fell short.</span></p><p>Too often, technology assumes the material world will keep pace with ambition. But ambition alone cannot dig rock from the ground\u2014and it definitely cannot create copper. I see a disconnect between belief and infrastructure. We believe this future is coming, but the physical systems required to support it are decades behind. If we want to build something durable, we need more than ambition and venture capital. We need metal, and we need smarter pathways to extract it.</p><p>If we want to keep building, we need to be clear about what we are building with. That means extraction, wiring, and chemistry\u2014the parts of the system that rarely make headlines but determine whether progress is possible.</p><p>The AI era will not be sustained by excitement. It will be sustained by copper. And the next leap in recovery may come from microbes\u2026tiny, ancient, and alive.</p>"

According to a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050925008439\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> published earlier this year in the journal <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/procedia-computer-science\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Procedia Computer Science</em></a>, a range of industries face simulation bottlenecks where, the authors say, \u201cexecuting high-fidelity simulation can take even weeks per design.\u201d</p><p>Surrogate models, the <em>Procedia </em>authors note, involve whittling equations down to simplified versions of the larger simulation environments. In other words, the surrogates capture essential behaviors of specific systems being modeled but without so much <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whats-better-than-40-gpubased-servers-a-server-with-40-gpus\" target=\"_blank\">computational overhead</a>. Often this trimming-down process can involve strategically sampling the original complex model at key points, and then training a faster approximation that can predict results for new scenarios.</p><p>\u201cYou can evaluate these models instantaneously,\u201d Sjodin says of COMSOL\u2019s surrogate modeling system. \u201cWhereas if you solve the full model with unknown inputs, it could take you 15 minutes. And people are very impatient.\u201d</p><p>According to Sjodin, European automotive manufacturers are now using COMSOL\u2019s surrogate models to rapidly simulate entire electric vehicle battery packs, enabling real-time decisions that managers and engineers had once needed to wait a coffee break or longer for. Meanwhile, Sjodin adds, a Swiss institute has deployed the COMSOL surrogate system as an app for Indian farmers to predict food spoilage in cold storage. The surrogate simulation, the institute found, enabled the farmers to reduce food spoilage by 20 percent. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Visualization of microstrip patch antenna with 3D gain analysis in simulation software.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5d198\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/visualization-of-microstrip-patch-antenna-with-3d-gain-analysis-in-simulation-software.jpg?id=61723155&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">COMSOL\u2019s full numerical simulations predict performance of an antenna surface (right sphere), while its streamlined surrogate model (left sphere) arrives at nearly the same results in substantially less running time.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">COMSOL</small></p><h3>Making Multiphysics Into an App</h3><p>Sjodin says COMSOL intends to turn users of the simulation system into something closer to software developers in their own right.</p><p>\u201cYou can compile those apps into standalone executables that you can distribute around the world without any kind of license payment,\u201d Sjodin says.</p><p>The company\u2019s surrogate models, he says, are able to run as standalone applications, which can work on laptops or smartphones.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to give this to someone on the factory floor, these surrogate models are really useful because it allows you to evaluate and get results immediately,\u201d Sjodin says. <span>The models run quickly compared to the full multiphysics simulation</span><span> because the app version of, say, a specific battery pack\u2019s thermal performance and chemical composition comes pre-loaded. The simulation is fast, because it already has on hand pre-calculated parameters specific to the physical environment to be simulated\u2014and only the environment to be simulated.</span></p><p>In addition to AI smarts that speed up the computing time for each run, COMSOL relies on other tricks as well. What modelers call <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction\" target=\"_blank\">\u201creduced order\u201d models</a> (ROMs) involve optimizations like mathematical pattern recognition and slimming down some of the more complicated equations in a calculation. \u201c<span>Neural networks come into play there, but also other technologies, more traditional reduced order modeling technologies,\u201d he says.</span></p><p>For instance, in a 2024 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2406.00559v2\" target=\"_blank\">industry-wide review of ROMs</a>, researchers from Trieste, Italy\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_School_for_Advanced_Studies\" target=\"_blank\">International School for Advanced Studies</a> described a range of ROM techniques that are based on more than just AI or neural networks.</p><p>\u201cROMs are divided in two big families: intrusive methods, in which one manipulates directly the governing equations, and non-intrusive methods, in which only the simulation data are considered,\u201d the researchers wrote.

The company says that the Eve 1V measures an object\u2019s motion with accuracy, repeatability, and reliability\u2014all without ever making contact with the material. That last point is key for the Eve 1V\u2019s intended environment: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductor-industry-in-india\" target=\"_blank\">Industrial manufacturing</a>.</p><p>Today\u2019s manufacturing lines are under pressure to deliver faster production, tighter tolerances, and zero defects, often while working with a wide variety of delicate materials. Traditional tactile tools such as measuring wheels and encoders can slip, wear out, and cause costly downtime. Many noncontact alternatives, while promising, are either too expensive or fall short in accuracy and reliability under real-world conditions, says <a href=\"https://investors.aeva.com/board-member/mina-rezk\" target=\"_blank\">Mina Rezk</a>, cofounder and chief technology officer at Aeva.</p><p>\u201cEve 1V was built to solve that exact gap: A compact, eye-safe, noncontact motion sensor that delivers submillimeter-per-second velocity accuracy without touching the material, so manufacturers can eliminate slippage errors, avoid material damage, and reduce maintenance-related downtime, enabling higher yield and more predictable operations,\u201d Rezk says.</p><p>Unlike traditional lidar that sends bursts of light and waits for those bursts to return to make measurements, FMCW continuously emits a low-power laser while sweeping its frequency. By comparing outgoing and returning signals, it detects frequency shifts that reveal both distance and velocity in real time. The additional measurement of an object\u2019s velocity to its position in three-dimensional space makes FMCW a type of 4D lidar.<strong></strong></p><p>Eve 1V is the second member of its Eve 1 family, following the launch of the <a href=\"https://investors.aeva.com/node/9096/pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://investors.aeva.com/node/9096/pdf\">Eve 1D earlier this year</a>. The Eve 1D is a compact displacement sensor capable of detecting movement at the micrometer scale, roughly 1/100 the thickness of a human hair. \u201cTogether, Eve 1D and Eve 1V show how we can take the same FMCW perception platform and tailor it for different industrial needs: Eve 1D for distance measurement and vibration detection, and Eve 1V for precise velocity and length measurement,\u201d Rezk says.</p><p>Future applications could extend into robotics, logistics, and consumer health, where noncontact sensing may enable the detection of microvibrations on human skin for accurate pulse and blood-pressure readings.</p><h2>FMCW Lidar for Precision Manufacturing</h2><p>The company\u2019s core FMCW architecture, originally developed for long-range 4D lidar for automobiles, can be adjusted through software and optics for highly precise motion sensing at close range in manufacturing, according to Rezk. This flexibility means the system can track extremely slow movements, down to fractions of a millimeter per second, in a factory setting, or it can monitor faster motion over longer distances in other applications.</p><p>By avoiding physical contact, Eve 1V eliminates wear and tear, slippage, contamination, or the need for physical access to the part. \u201cThat delivers three practical advantages in a factory: One, maintenance-free operation with no measuring wheels to replace or recalibrate; two, material friendliness\u2014you can measure delicate, soft, or textured surfaces without risk of damage, and three, operational robustness\u2014no slippage errors and fewer stoppages for service,\u201d Rezk says. Put together, that means more uptime, steady throughput, and less scrap, he adds.</p><p>When measuring velocity, engineers often rely on one of three tools: encoders, laser velocimeters, or camera-based systems. Each has its strengths and its drawbacks. Traditional encoders are low-cost but can wear down over time. Laser-based velocity-measurement systems, while precise, tend to be large and expensive, making them difficult to implement widely. And camera-based approaches can work for certain inspection tasks, but they usually require markers, controlled lighting, and complex processing to measure speed accurately.</p><p>Rezk says that the Eve 1V system offers a balance of these options. It provides precise and consistent velocity measurements without contacting material, making it compact, safe, and simple to install. Its outputs are comparable with existing encoder systems, and because it doesn\u2019t rely on physical contact, it requires minimal maintenance.</p><p>This approach helps cut down on wasted energy from slippage, eliminates the need for maintenance tied to parts that wear out, and ultimately lowers long-term operating costs\u2014especially when compared with traditional contact-based systems or expensive laser options.</p><p>This method avoids stitching together frame-by-frame comparisons and resists interference from sunlight, reflections, or ambient light. Built on silicon photonics, it scales from micrometer-level sensing to millimeter-level precision over longer ranges. The result is clean, repeatable data with minimal noise\u2014outperforming legacy lidar and camera-based systems.</p><p>Aeva is expecting to begin full production of the Eve 1V in early 2026. The Eve 1V reveal follows <a href=\"https://www.aeva.com/press/aeva-and-lg-innotek-form-strategic-collaboration-to-bring-next-generation-perception-platform-to-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.aeva.com/press/aeva-and-lg-innotek-form-strategic-collaboration-to-bring-next-generation-perception-platform-to-market/\">a recent partnership with LG Innotek</a>, a components subsidiary of South Korea\u2019s LG Group, under which Aeva will supply its Atlas Ultra 4D lidar for automobiles, with plans to expand the technology into consumer electronics, robotics, and industrial automation.</p>"

Natron\u2019s success in this space, including its plans for the North Carolina factory, prompted questions about whether sodium-ion could emerge as a direct replacement for lithium-ion batteries. <a href=\"https://natron.energy/files/news/releases/natron-united-joint-release-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>United Airlines</span></a> and <a href=\"https://enginetech.com/why-is-chevron-investing-in-sodium-ion-batteries/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Chevron</span></a> were on the list of Natron\u2019s investors.</p><p>But Evans says scaling up a low-energy density product while building out manufacturing lines is expensive. \u201cIf you think about building a manufacturing facility where you want to produce 10 gigawatt hours of batteries, if your energy density is very low, producing an equivalent number of batteries requires more manufacturing lines,\u201d Evans says.</p><p>\u201cIf you think about building a manufacturing facility where you want to produce a gigawatt-hour of battery manufacturing capacity, if your energy density per battery cell is very low, producing that capacity requires more manufacturing lines,\u201d Evans says, meaning significantly more capital and operational expenditure in an already capital-intensive undertaking.</p><p>In 2023, Natron\u2019s systems made it to market.
