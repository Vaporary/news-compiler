Beyond the direct damages, market distortions, supply chains, changes in capital and labor costs, etc. can potentially magnify (or diminish) the costs of these shocks. In this paper, we use analytical and numerical general equilibrium models to investigate the channels through which microeconomic shocks affect the macroeconomy. We model different types of shocks, evaluate how anticipation affects the macroeconomic implications of shocks, and measure the overall welfare costs relative to the value of direct damages. We find that preexisting taxes magnify the overall welfare costs relative to direct damages, that savings and investment decisions driven by anticipations of certain types of shocks can interact with tax distortions to lower welfare costs, and that the ratio of welfare cost to direct damages varies substantially across sectors of the economy."

        "summary": "We coin the term Global Stratification Economics (GSE) to extend Stratification Economics (SE) to international contexts where mechanisms emerge that can be identified as (1) universal but matched to positioning along a country\u2019s development path or (2) context-specific and historically dependent in ways different from the United States and other international environments. Building on SE\u2019s core insight that groups compete over scarce resources and that dominant groups shape rules to preserve advantage, we define GSE as an approach that foregrounds historical genesis (e.g., settler colonialism, slavery, caste, extractive governance, military intervention), local institutions that structure dominance and resistance, and transnational mechanisms (e.g., imported stratification and the lateral mobility hypothesis) that link origin- and destination-country hierarchies. Drawing on evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the global macroeconomy, we synthesize research on intergenerational mobility, wealth and asset inequality, labor-market segmentation, colorism, caste and ethnicity, gendered and intersectional constraints, spatial inequality and property regimes, and global value chains. We conclude by outlining how GSE reshapes measurement and international policy evaluation by centering group-differentiated outcomes, institutional transformation, and pillars of recognition, redistribution, and repair and by offering a checklist for researchers to apply GSE."

        "summary": "We present new evidence on how firms set prices using direct questions from a large, economy-wide survey of UK firms. Since 2023, 54% of firms report setting prices in a state-dependent manner, as opposed to changing prices at fixed intervals. In contrast, 44% of firms used state-dependent pricing in 2019. Smaller firms, those with a higher share of non-labour costs, and those reporting higher subjective uncertainty around sales and prices are more likely to be state-dependent. We then analyse the implications of price-setting behaviour for inflation dynamics. State-dependent firms experienced a sharper increase in price growth over 2022-2023, and also a faster subsequent decline. Using evidence from a randomised survey experiment, firm-level forecast errors, and local projections, we show that prices of state-dependent firms respond faster to cost shocks. The difference between state-dependent and time-dependent firms is furthermore larger for bigger shocks, consistent with theoretical predictions."

        "summary": "In models with subjective beliefs, the dynamics of investor beliefs are central to explaining asset price movements. Allowing subjective beliefs to deviate from full-information rational expectations requires a model of how investors form beliefs. I review recent research that explores experience-based belief formation. The experience-based model closely resembles Bayesian updating but allows individuals to overweight data observed during their own lifetimes when forming beliefs about the parameters of the data-generating process. Because individuals of different age learn from different histories, the model predicts heterogeneity between age groups that evolves over time with the path of realized data individuals have experienced, closely mirroring the age-related variation observed in survey microdata. At the aggregate level, experience-based expectations formation can explain asset price dynamics. In the stock market, learning from experience about long-run cash flow growth generates valuation cycles and return predictability. Experience-based formation of long-term inflation expectations can explain secular changes of real interest rates. I conclude by outlining directions for future research."

        "summary": "Using surveys and administrative data from representative samples of drivers working on three leading gig platforms in India, Indonesia, and Kenya, we document the composition, economic experiences, and labor market trajectories of platform workers. Combining platform-based earnings with operating cost data, we estimate earnings net of costs (in PPP-adjusted terms) in each context. We find that the flexible nature of platform work enables drivers to work substantially more than the full-time equivalent, generating higher monthly net earnings than low-skill or casual employment, despite comparable or lower hourly net earnings relative to these outside options. Drivers who exit platform work in India and Indonesia do so to take up better-paying full-time positions. In contrast, Kenyan drivers often exit involuntarily, returning to offline driving with adverse financial consequences. One-third of drivers across countries rely on platform work to supplement earnings during emergencies or slow work periods, suggesting that platform work may play an important role as a financial safety net."

Most notably, the </span><span><a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en\" target=\"_blank\"><span>carbon tax for goods entering the EU</span></a></span> has, as of January 2026, transitioned from a reporting exercise into a direct financial liability\u2014a shift supported by <span><a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/green-deal-industrial-plan_en\" target=\"_blank\"><span>initiatives to boost competitiveness</span></a></span> in clean energy and green infrastructure.</p><p>Beyond Europe, companies face similar emissions reporting requirements in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-enshrine-mandatory-climate-disclosures-for-largest-companies-in-law\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/mandatory-climate-related-financial-disclosures/\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sgx.com/sustainable-finance/sustainability-reporting\">Singapore</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/exxon-apple-and-other-corporate-giants-will-have-to-disclose-all-their-emissions-under-californias-new-climate-laws-that-will-have-a-global-impact-214630\">California</a>, and cities such as <a href=\"https://www.sfc.hk/en/Rules-and-standards/Securities-and-Futures-Ordinance-Part-XV---Disclosure-of-Interests\">Hong Kong</a>.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">While companies can pause their storytelling, they must still invest in the hard data infrastructure required to count their carbon.</p><p><span>While timelines for some of those laws have shifted, the underlying momentum remains. For example, while California temporarily halted a law requiring companies to publish narrative reports on their climate risks (SB 261), the mandate for hard emissions data (SB 253) remains on track for 2026. This \u201cquantitative yes, qualitative maybe\u201d status means that while companies can pause their storytelling, they must still invest in the hard data infrastructure required to count their carbon.</span></p><p><span></span><span>The</span><span> </span><span>International Court of Justice gave legal backing to such initiatives in July 2025 when it  </span>issued an <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/case/187\">advisory opinion</a> establishing that countries around the globe have a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-world-court-just-ruled-countries-can-be-held-liable-for-climate-change-damage-what-does-that-mean-for-the-us-262272\">legal obligation to protect the climate</a>. That decision may ultimately increase pressure on global businesses to reduce their contributions to climate change.</p><h2>Multinationals put pressure on supply chains</h2><p>Multinational companies\u2019 efforts to reduce their climate impact puts pressure on their suppliers\u2014meaning many more companies must take their climate impact into consideration.</p><p>For instance, U.S.-based Walmart operates over 10,000 stores across <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/about/location-facts\">19 countries</a> and is the largest single buyer of goods in the world. That means it faces a wide range of regulations, including tracking and reducing emissions from its suppliers. In 2017, it launched Project Gigaton, aiming to cut 1 gigaton of supply-chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Suppliers including Nestle, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Hanes helped the company <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/02/21/walmart-suppliers-lead-the-charge-help-deliver-project-gigaton-goal-more-than-six-years-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reach its target six years early</a> through practical measures such as boosting energy efficiency, redesigning packaging, and reducing food waste. <span>While the data is verified through internal quality controls co-developed with NGOs like the Environmental Defense Fund, analysts at </span><span><a href=\"https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CTA100-Walmart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Planet Tracker</a></span> note that these \u201cavoided\u201d emissions haven\u2019t yet stopped Walmart\u2019s absolute footprint from rising alongside its business growth.</p><p><span>In early 2025, this growth led Walmart to </span><span><a href=\"https://trellis.net/article/walmart-2025-esg-update/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>push back its interim deadlines</span></a></span> for two of its most ambitious emissions-reduction targets. Despite these delays, Walmart\u2019s \u201cemissions intensity\u201d\u2014the carbon produced per dollar of revenue\u2014has <span><a href=\"https://www.csofutures.com/news/walmart-warns-it-will-miss-2025-and-2030-targets-as-sales-growth-push-up-emissions/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>fallen by roughly 47 percent</span></a></span> over the past decade. Moreover<span>, </span>almost half of its electricity worldwide came from renewable energy in 2024, its emissions per unit of revenue fell, and it is still targeting zero emissions from its operations by 2040.</p><h2>There are profits to be made in clean tech</h2><p>In addition to facing pressure from buyers and governments, companies see profits to be made from investing in climate-friendly clean technology.</p><p>Since 2016, investments in clean energy have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/energy-environment/trump-renewable-energy-batteries.html\">outpaced that of fossil fuels</a> globally. This trend has only hastened, with nearly twice as much invested in clean energy as fossil fuels in 2025.</p><p></p><p>Lately, myriad <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00743-7\">new business opportunities</a> for multinational companies and startups alike have focused on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/amazon-sustainability-officers-ai-tool-climate-change/\">meeting AI\u2019s energy demand</a> through clean energy.</p><p>From 2014 to 2024, the climate tech sector yielded total <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/q1-2025/\">returns of nearly 200 percent</a>, and U.S. investment in climate tech was <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">still growing in 2025</a>.</p><p>In the first half of 2025, <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">close to one-fifth</a> of the more than 1,600 venture deals in climate tech were made by corporations for strategic reasons, such as technology access, supply chain integration, or future product offerings. <span>Corporate strategic deals continued to represent about </span><a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NZI_2025-State-of-Climate-Tech-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>20 to 23 percent</span></a> of all climate tech equity transactions through the third and fourth quarters of 2025.</p><p><span>However, this surge in investment is more than a search for profit; it is a defensive necessity as the tech industry\u2019s growth begins to collide with its environmental limits.</span></p><h2>The AI energy paradox</h2><p><span>The rapid expansion of AI is forcing multinational companies to make explicit choices about their climate priorities. While tech leaders once relied on annual renewable credits to meet climate targets, the scale of the AI power boom is forcing more rigorous carbon accounting. Global data centers are </span><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai\" target=\"_blank\"><span>projected</span></a> to consume more electricity than Japan by 2030, a shift that turns \u201cvoluntary\u201d climate investments into a core business requirement for securing 24/7 energy supplies.</p><p><span>In 2025, the tech giants\u2019 own reports revealed the scale of AI emissions. Microsoft\u2019s 2025 Environmental Sustainability Report revealed a 23.4 percent </span><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/29/environmental-sustainability-report/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>increase</span></a> in total emissions since its 2020 baseline. Similarly, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2025-environmental-report/\">emissions have climbed 51 percent since 2019</a>, with a 22 percent surge in Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions in 2024 alone. <span>Amazon\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2024-report\" target=\"_blank\"><span>2024 Sustainability Report</span></a> noted a 33 percent jump since 2019 driven by the construction of new data centers. Meta\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2025-sustainability-report/\">supplier\u2019s emissions (99 percent of its total footprint) are being driven to new heights</a> by the \u201cembodied carbon\u201d of AI hardware.</p><p><span>While high costs might tempt some to cut corners, climate action could instead become a hedge against energy volatility. C</span>ompanies like Amazon and Google are securing reliable supply by leveraging <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\">federal fast-tracking of nuclear permits</a> to act as primary offtakers for the first generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). <span>This shift is accelerated by new federal orders to bypass nuclear licensing hurdles, as seen in Google\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/google-and-kairos-power-team-up-for-smr-deployments-in-us-first\" target=\"_blank\"><span>landmark agreement with Kairos Power</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/amazon-invests-in-x-energy-unveils-smr-project-plans\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Amazon\u2019s $500 million investment in X-energy</span></a><span>\u2014deals designed to secure the 24/7 \u201cbaseload\u201d power AI requires without abandoning carbon-free commitments. Despite their advanced designs, SMRs are still provoking </span><span></span>debate over their <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2111833119\" target=\"_blank\">radioactive waste</a> and the potential risks of deploying nuclear technology <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/25/2025-18633/regulatory-guide-emergency-response-planning-and-preparedness-for-nuclear-power-reactors\" target=\"_blank\">closer to populated industrial hubs</a>.</p><h2>Companies look to their customers and the future</h2><p>As climate risks grow alongside political headwinds, companies are facing both pushes toward and pulls away from protecting the planet from catastrophic effects. Oil and gas companies, for example, <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/oil-and-gas-investment-is-more-important-than-ever\">continue to invest</a> in new oil and gas development. However, they also forecast <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/all-energy-types-are-needed\">renewable energy growth accelerating</a> and are investing in clean tech.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6016/chapter/5709986/Consumer-Facing-and-Carbon-Intensive-Sectors-A\">corporate leaders I interviewed</a>, from tech companies like Intel to sporting goods and apparel companies like Adidas, talked about aligning sustainability efforts and initiatives across their business globally whenever possible. This proactive approach allows them to more seamlessly collect data and respond to pressures arising domestically and globally, minimizing the need for costly patchwork efforts later. Moreover, global businesses know they will continue to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/feliciajackson/2025/11/07/international-standards-could-turn-net-zero-into-common-practice/\">face demands</a> from their customers, investors, and employees to be better stewards of the planet.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges</p><p><span>In a 2025 Getty Images </span><a href=\"http://reports.gettyimages.com/VisualGPS-Visualizing-Sustainability-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>survey</span></a> of over 5,000 consumers across 25 countries, more than 80 percent of respondents reported that they expect clear ESG guidelines from businesses. Furthermore, these consumers\u2014from Brazil, Australia, and Japan to the U.K. and U.S.\u2014are increasingly using GenAI-driven shopping assistants to filter for \u201cresponsible business\u201d practices.</p><p><span>U.S. market </span><a href=\"https://www.hartman-group.com/reports/274144747/sustainability-2025-do-consumers-care\" target=\"_blank\"><span>research</span></a> from the Hartman Group corroborates this trend<span>: 71 percent of surveyed food and beverage consumers consider environmental and social impacts in their purchasing decisions.

The divergence between federal deregulation in Washington and the rigid physical demands of the AI revolution has created a new era of corporate pragmatism. While some firms may use political shifts to \u201cgreenhush\u201d or delay abstract pledges, the world\u2019s largest corporations are finding that they cannot simply account away the massive energy and infrastructure requirements of the AI Age. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges. In this new landscape, the global businesses that thrive will be those that build carbon-free foundations, while responding to existing and future laws across the globe.</span></p><p><em>This article is adapted by the author from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Because they\u2019re invisible to the naked eye, such fractures are challenging to detect, Kizildemir says.</p><p>The project was done in collaboration with the U.S. <a href=\"https://railroads.dot.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Railroad Administration</a>\u2014part of the <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Transportation</a>\u2014which is looking to adjust technical standards and employ mitigation strategies.</p><p>Kizildemir and five colleagues designed and implemented testing protocols and physics-based simulations to detect cracks earlier and prevent their spread. Their research has given the Railroad Administration insights into structural defects that are being used to revise rail-building guidelines and inspection protocols. The administration published the <a href=\"https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/76534\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first phase</a> of the research in 2024.</p><p>After graduating in 2018, Kizildemir began a summer internship as a civil engineer at Thornton Tomasetti. She conducted computational modeling using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abaqus</a> software for rails subjected to repeated plastic deformation\u2014material that permanently changes shape when under excessive stress\u2014and presented her recommendations for improvement to the company\u2019s management.</p><p>During her internship, she worked with professors in different fields, including materials behavior and mechanical engineering. The experience, she says, inspired her to pursue a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh, continuing her research with the Railroad Administration. She earned her degree in 2023.</p><p>She loved the work and the team at Thornton Tomasetti so much, she says, that she applied to work at the company, where she is now a project engineer.</p><h2>From simulations to real-world applications</h2><p>Her work focuses on developing finite element models for critical infrastructure and extreme events.</p><p>Finite modeling breaks complex systems or topics into small elements connected together to numerically simulate real-world situations. She creates computational models of structures enduring realistic catastrophic events, such as a vehicle crashing into a building.</p><p>She uses simulations to understand how buildings react to attacks such as the one on 9/11, which, she says, is often used as an example of why such research is essential.</p><p>When starting a project, she and her team review building standards and try to identify new issues not yet covered by them. The team then adapts existing codes and standards, usually developed for well-understood hazards such as earthquakes, wind, and floods, to define simulation parameters.</p><p>When a new structure is being built, for example, it is not designed to withstand a truck crashing into it. But Kizildemir and her team want to know how the building would react should that happen. They simulate the environments and situations, and they make recommendations based on the results to reduce or eliminate risks of structural failure.</p><p>Mitigation suggestions include specific strategies to be implemented during project design and construction.</p><p>Simulations can be created for any infrastructure, Kizildemir says.</p><p>\u201cI love problems that force me to think differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to keep growing.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to live by Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s internal motto: \u201cWhen others say no, we say \u2018Here\u2019s how.\u2019\u201d</p><h2>Joining IEEE and getting more involved</h2><p>When Kizildemir first heard of IEEE, she assumed it was only for electrical engineers. But after learning how diverse and inclusive the organization is, she joined in 2024. She has since been elevated to a senior member and has become a volunteer. She joined the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMTEM014\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society</a>.</p><p>She chaired the conference tracks and IEEE-sponsored sessions at the 2024 <a href=\"https://event.asme.org/Joint-Rail-Conference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Rail Conference</a>, held in Columbia, S.C. She actively contributes to IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Collabratec platform</a> and has participated in panel review meetings for senior member elevation applications.</p><p>She\u2019s also a member of <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASME</a> and has been volunteering for it since 2023.</p><p>\u201cCommunity is what helped get me to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward and make the field better,\u201d she says. \u201cHelping others improves ourselves.\u201d</p><h2>Looking ahead and giving back</h2><p>Kizildemir mentors junior engineers at Thornton Thomasetti and is looking to expand her reach through <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/mentoring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE\u2019s mentorship programs</a>.</p><p>\u201cEngineering doesn\u2019t have a gender requirement,\u201d she says she tells girls. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious and like understanding how things work and get excited to solve difficult problems, engineering is for you.</p><p>\u201cCivil engineers don\u2019t just build bridges,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere are countless niche areas to be explored. Engineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.\u201d</p><p>Kizildemir says she wants every engineer to be able to improve their community. Her main piece of advice for recent engineering graduates is that \u201ccuriosity, discipline, and the willingness to understand things deeply, to see how things can be done better,\u201d are the keys to success.</p>"

Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills\u2014capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace.</p><p>AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybercrime\" target=\"_self\">cybercrime</a>, predict equipment failures in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stealthy-startup-aims-to-reinvent-ai-for-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">manufacturing</a>, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-jobs\" target=\"_self\">mass layoffs</a> across much of the technology sector.

Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy.</p><p>Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write.</p><p>The guide cites surveys of executives about AI\u2019s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey & Co.</a> The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants\u2019 insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate.</p><p>The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve.</p><h2>Developing complementary skills</h2><p>The strategic approach aligns with advice from <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/neil-thompson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Thompson</a>, director of FutureTech research at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.</p><p>\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,\u201d he says. \u201cApplying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.\u201d</p><h2>The technical foundation still matters</h2><p>Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning\" target=\"_self\"> machine learning</a>, and computing infrastructure.</p><p>Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say.</p><p>Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say.</p><p>Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Web Services</a>,<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Cloud</a>, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmfq865whp_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21503043035&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_sCA_X2u0APALLSysANK0Vhk&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure</a> is important, according to the guide\u2019s authors.</p><p>Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2025\" target=\"_self\">Python</a> has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models.</p><h2>From algorithms to frameworks</h2><p>The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PyTorch</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.meta.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meta AI</a>, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scikit-learn</a> provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. <strong>\u2014Neil Thompson, MIT</strong> </p><p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TensorFlow</a>, a software library for machine learning and AI created by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?zx=1767047914659&amp;no_sw_cr=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction.</p><p>The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints.</p><h2>Soft skills as career insurance</h2><p>Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders.</p><p>Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning.</p><p>Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt.</p><h2>Experience before titles</h2><p>The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience.</p><p>Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career.</p><h2>Entry-level roles that open doors</h2><p>Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide.</p><p>Each starting point reinforces the guide\u2019s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance.</p><h2>Curiosity as a long-term strategy</h2><p>Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process.</p><p>\u201cAlways be curious,\u201d he says. \u201cLearn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.\u201d</p><p>Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one\u2019s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend.</p><p>In a field where today\u2019s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide\u2019s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.</p>"

In talking to Xcel line workers and fellow safety engineers, he sensed that the accident cluster might be the tip of an iceberg. And when he and two industry colleagues scoured data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, they found 81 induction accidents between 1985 and 2021 and 60 deaths, which they documented in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9925039\" target=\"_blank\">a 2022 report</a>.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it is really common.

Both are interwoven with conductive materials such as stainless steel threads, which form a Faraday cage that shields the wearer against the lines\u2019 electric fields. But the standard suits have limited capacity to shunt current because usually they don\u2019t need to. Like a bird on a wire, bare-hands workers are electrically floating, rather than grounded, so current largely bypasses them via the line itself.</p><h2>Induction Safety Suit Design</h2><p>Backed by a US $250,000 investment from Xcel in 2019, Electrostatics adapted its standard suits by adding low-resistance conductive straps that pass current around a worker\u2019s body. \u201cWhen I\u2019m touching a conductor with one hand and the other hand is grounded, the current will flow through the straps to get out,\u201d says <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/n%25C3%25A9meth-b%25C3%25A1lint-1a366586?originalSubdomain=hu\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00e1lint N\u00e9meth</a>, Electrostatics\u2019 CEO and director of the <a href=\"https://nfl.vet.bme.hu/en/\" target=\"_blank\">High Voltage Laboratory</a> at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man holds one side of his jacket open revealing conductive straps inside.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c7b7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-holds-one-side-of-his-jacket-open-revealing-conductive-straps-inside.jpg?id=62695052&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A strapping system links all the elements of the suit\u2014the jacket, trousers, gloves, and socks\u2014and guides current through a controlled path outside the body. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">BME HVL </small></p><p>The company began selling the suits in 2023, and they have since been adopted by over a dozen transmission operators in the United States and Europe, as well as other countries including Canada, Indonesia, and Turkey. They cost about $5,200 in the United States.</p><p>Electrostatics\u2019 suits had to meet a crucial design threshold: keeping body exposure below the 6-milliampere \u201clet-go\u201d threshold, beyond which electrocuted workers become unable to remove themselves from a circuit. \u201cIf you lose control of your muscles, you\u2019re going to hold onto the conductor until you pass out or possibly die,\u201d says Ramirez Bettoni.</p><p>The gear, which includes the suit, gloves, and socks, protects against 100 amperes for 10 seconds and 50 A for 30 seconds. It also has insulation to protect against heat created by high current and flame retardants to protect against electric arcs.</p><p>Kropp, N\u00e9meth, and Ramirez Bettoni are hoping that developing industry standards for induction safety gear, including <a href=\"https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/standard-performance-specification-for-conductive-clothing-for-industry-applications\" target=\"_blank\">ones published in October</a>, will broaden their use.

In 1877, Edison had introduced <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/edisons-phonograph\" target=\"_blank\">the phonograph</a>, which he later declared <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2022/03/thomas-edisons-favorite-invention-the-phonograph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his favorite invention</a>. And yet he wasn\u2019t quite certain about its commercial applications. Initially, he thought it might be good for recording telephone messages. Then he began to imagine other uses: a mechanical stenographer for businessmen, a notetaker for students, an elocution instructor, a talking book for the blind. The playback of recorded music\u2014the phonograph\u2019s eventual killer app\u2014was No. 4 on <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edison\u2019s list</a>. And after a few public demonstrations, he set aside the invention to pursue other interests.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an apparatus consisting of a metal cylinder on a metal rod with a handle, seated on a flat rectangular base. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b77c1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-an-apparatus-consisting-of-a-metal-cylinder-on-a-metal-rod-with-a-handle-seated-on-a-flat-rectangular.jpg?id=62563774&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Thomas Edison\u2019s early phonograph from 1877 used a needle to record sound waves on a rotating cylinder wrapped with tinfoil. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Thomas Edison National Historical Park/National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior</small></p><p>Enter Bell. In 1880, the French government had awarded Bell the Volta Prize and 50,000 francs (about US $10,000 at the time) for his invention of the telephone. The following year, he, his cousin Chichester A. Bell, and Charles Sumner Tainter used the prize money to found the Volta Laboratory Association in Washington, D.C., to do research on sound recording and transmission.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/particle-physics-resurrects-alexander-graham-bells-voice\" target=\"_self\">Particle Physics Resurrects Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s Voice</a></p><p>Tainter saw potential in the phonograph. Edison\u2019s version used a needle to etch sound waves on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a metal cylinder. The foil was easily damaged, the sound quality was distorted and squeaky, and the cylinder could be replayed only a few times before degrading and becoming inaudible. Edison\u2019s phonograph couldn\u2019t be easily commercialized, in other words.</p><p>Chichester Bell and Tainter greatly improved the sound quality by replacing the tinfoil with <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\" target=\"_blank\">wax-coated cardboard cylinders</a>. By 1886, the researchers at Volta Lab had a <a href=\"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/da/79/62/6a4a3e32433adc/US341214.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">patented product</a>: the Graphophone.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Engraving of a man sitting on a chair and holding a tube to his mouth.

As a \u201cdictator,\u201d you would speak into the tube, and a stylus would trace the sound wave on the wax cylinder. The cylinder would then be handed off to a secretary for transcription. Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary.</p><p>A manufacturing company set up by Volta Lab sold several machines to the U.S. government. One enthusiastic early adopter was Edward D. Easton, a noted stenographer for the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Easton took notes in shorthand, he immediately recited his notes into the Graphophone after each session.</p><p>Easton became an evangelist for the instrument, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Phonogram1_4/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">writing glowing accounts</a> in a trade magazine. The machine made no mistakes and could take dictation as fast as the speaker could articulate. The phonograph never complained when a transcriber needed a phrase repeated. The phonograph didn\u2019t suffer from poor penmanship. Anyone could learn to use the machine in two weeks or less, compared to months or years to master stenography. Such were Easton\u2019s claims. (Easton was such a fan that he cofounded the Columbia Phonograph Co., which went on to become a leading maker of phonographs and recorded music and lives on today as <a href=\"https://www.columbiarecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia Records</a>.)</p><p>Before long, several companies were manufacturing and selling phonographs and dictation machines. Even though demand was initially light, patent-infringement lawsuits sprang up, which soon threatened to bankrupt all of the companies involved. Finally, in 1896, the various parties agreed to stop fighting and to cross-license each other\u2019s intellectual property. This didn\u2019t end the Bell-Edison rivalry, but it allowed the phonograph business to take off in earnest, aided by the sales of mass-produced recorded music cylinders. And the accepted name for this entertainment machine became the phonograph.</p><h2>The Dictaphone Gets Down to Business</h2><p>But Bell, Tainter, and Edison didn\u2019t forget the original promise of mechanical stenography, and the rivals soon came out with competing and very similar products designed specifically for dictation: the Dictaphone and the Ediphone. The public found it difficult to distinguish the two products, and it wasn\u2019t long before \u201cdictaphone\u201d was being used to describe all dictation machines. (The Columbia Graphophone Co. trademarked \u201cDictaphone\u201d in 1907\u2014a confusing neologism of <em><em>dicta</em></em> from the Latin for \u201csayings\u201d or \u201csay repeatedly\u201d and <em><em>phone</em></em> from the Greek for \u201cvoice\u201d or \u201csound.\u201d)</p><p>As David Morton recounts in his 1999 book <em><em>Off the Record</em></em> (Rutgers University Press), Dictaphone sales accelerated as scientific management for business began to take root. Office managers intent on streamlining, standardizing, and systemizing workflows saw the Dictaphone as a labor-saving device. In 1912, for instance, an efficiency commission set up by U.S. President William Taft endorsed the use of dictation machines in government offices. The railroad and insurance industries followed suit as they standardized their financial records. Later, managers began using dictation machines to conquer their business correspondence.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an older man with a moustache holding a tube near his mouth.

The U.S. government was an early adopter of the machines.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Library of Congress</small></p><p>And yet, the Dictaphone wasn\u2019t obviously destined to become an indispensable piece of office equipment like the typewriter. In 1923, for instance, 15,000 dictation machines were sold in the United States, versus 744,000 typewriters.</p><p>In 1926, the Dictaphone Corp. tried to drum up interest by sponsoring Henry Lunn, founder of a large U.K. travel company, on an around-the-world lecture tour. At each hotel he visited, the company ensured there was a Dictaphone for Lunn to record his diary. Consider this a prototype for the modern hotel business center. At the end of his journey, Lunn published <em><em>Round the World With a Dictaphone</em></em>\u2014part travelogue, part proselytizing for Christian churches to support the League of Nations, and part Dictaphone promotion. Even so, by 1945, Dictaphone estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of the potential market had been captured.</p><p>There were social reasons working against dictation machines, Morton says in his book. Executives relied on their secretaries not only for dictation and transcription, but also for their often unacknowledged aid in prompting, correcting, and filling in their bosses\u2019 thoughts\u2014the soft skills that a machine could not replace.</p><p>Morton also attributes the slow uptake to the technology itself. One quirk of the Dictaphone is that it continued to use wax cylinders long after phonograph players had switched to discs. Transcribers often complained that the wax recordings were unintelligible\u2014dictators needed to speak directly into the speaking tube, loudly, clearly, and at an appropriate pace, but many did not.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman sitting at a manual typewriter and wearing headphones that connect to a machine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"df276\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-sitting-at-a-manual-typewriter-and-wearing-headphones-that-connect-to-a-machine.jpg?id=62564524&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A secretary plays back the sound from a recorded Ediphone cylinder in 1930 to transcribe the cylinder\u2019s contents.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Popperfoto/Getty Images</small></p><p>During World War II, Dictaphone finally ditched the wax cylinders in favor of etching grooves on a plastic belt, although the new machines were available only to U.S. government agencies until the end of the war. In 1947, the company publicly introduced the new technology with its Time-Master series. Each Dictabelt held about 15 minutes of recording. Meanwhile, Edison\u2019s Ediphone was rebranded the <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2016/09/15/take-a-memo/\" target=\"_blank\">Voicewriter</a> and recorded on distinctive red plastic discs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a rectangular device with a long cord and microphone and 3 reddish discs with a hole in the middle. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f63d1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-rectangular-device-with-a-long-cord-and-microphone-and-3-reddish-discs-with-a-hole-in-the-middle.jpg?id=62564655&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This 1953 Edison Voicewriter recorded the speaker\u2019s voice on plastic Diamond Discs. Magnetic tape came later.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian Design Museum/Smithsonian Institution</small></p><p>In the 1960s, Dictaphone finally embraced magnetic recording tape, in the form of cassette tapes. Pressure initially came from European companies, such as the Dutch electronics company Philips, which entered the U.S. market in 1958 with a low-priced tape-cartridge machine. Four years later, Philips introduced the Compact Cassette, which became the basis of today\u2019s audio cassette. Transistorized electronics furthered miniaturization and made dictation machines much more portable. Eventually, solid-state storage replaced magnetic tape, and today, we all carry around a dictation device with an effectively infinite recording time via cloud storage, and, if we choose to use it, automatic transcription.</p><h2>The Dictaphone in the Classroom</h2><p>None of the stories about businessmen using (or abusing) Dictaphones really surprised me. What did surprise me were the creative ways the Dictaphone was used as a pedagogical tool.</p><p>In 1924, for example, Dwight Everett Watkins at the University of California described in a paper how his students used a microphone, an amplifier, a telemegaphone (a type of speaker), and a Dictaphone to aid in public speaking. The setup helped students understand their rhetorical imperfections: bad grammar and bad sentence and paragraph structure. It also helped with elocution\u2014one of the early applications that Edison envisioned for his phonograph.</p><p>In 1933, George F. Meyer wrote about using the Dictaphone as an educational aid for blind and low-vision students in Minneapolis. Teachers recorded course material that would otherwise have had to be read aloud. And the students liked being able to listen to the material repeatedly without inconveniencing a human reader.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman seated to the left and typing on a typewriter, with a crowd of young women standing around her wearing headphones that connect to a machine at the typist\\u2019s side.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"568fe\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-seated-to-the-left-and-typing-on-a-typewriter-with-a-crowd-of-young-women-standing-around-her.jpg?id=62564721&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Students in 1930 listen to a Dictaphone recording, which the seated woman controls with foot pedals.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images</small></p><p>In 1938, Frances M. Freeman wrote her master\u2019s thesis on whether the Dictaphone could help typing students who were struggling to master the skill. Her study was supported by the Dictaphone Sales Corp., but unfortunately for the company, she concluded that using a Dictaphone offered no advantage in learning to type. She did find that the students in the Dictaphone group seemed more alert in class than students taught the traditional way.</p><p>That last finding was borne out in a 1964 experiment at Dunbar Elementary School in New Orleans, where the Dictaphone Corp. had outfitted an \u201celectronic classroom.\u201d The idea was to help reluctant students by fostering an environment where learning was fun. As Principal Beulah E. Brown related in an article about the experiment, she\u2019d first encountered a Dictaphone several years earlier while on sabbatical and immediately saw its pedagogical potential. The Dictaphone, Brown wrote, promised individually tailored educational experiences, allowing students to focus on specific challenges and freeing the teacher to have more personal interactions with each child. Testimonials from Warren Honore\u2019s fifth grade class attest to its success as an engaging technology.</p><h2>From the Dictaphone to Email to AI</h2><p>As a historian of technology, I loved learning that two heavyweights in the field, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/us/melvin-kranzberg-78-historian-of-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">Melvin Kranzberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Kuhn</a>, were both committed fans of the Dictaphone. I also enjoyed meditating on the role of the dictaphone and other technology as a mediator in the writing process.</p><p>My research turned up <a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/tolstoys-dictaphone\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Tolstoy\u2019s Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse</em></em></a> (Graywolf Press), a 1996 collection of essays edited by the literary critic <a href=\"https://agnionline.bu.edu/about/our-people/authors/sven-birkerts/\" target=\"_blank\">Sven Birkerts</a><em><em>. </em></em>The title comes from an anecdote about the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who refused the offer of a Dictaphone because it would be \u201ctoo dreadfully exciting\u201d and would distract him from his literary pursuits. To form the volume, Birkerts posed questions to his authors concerning the place of self and soul in a society being bombarded with new forms of communication\u2014namely, email and the internet.</p><p>Today, of course, our world is being shaped by AI, arguably an even bigger disrupter than email was in the 1990s or the Dictaphone was in the early 20th century. But then, technology is always trying to remake society, and the path it takes is never inevitable. Sometimes, when we\u2019re lucky, it is delightfully surprising.</p><p><em>Part of a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\">continuing series</a> looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></p><p><span><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2026 print issue as \u201cThis Machine Listened to \u2018Dictators.\u2019 \u201d</em></span></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>David Morton emailed me and suggested I write about the Dictaphone after hearing me <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1127295581\" target=\"_blank\">give a talk</a> about this series.

Getting Past Procrastination</a></h2><p>Across a decade working at hypergrowth tech companies like Meta and Pinterest, I constantly struggled with procrastination. I\u2019d be assigned an important project, but I simply couldn\u2019t get myself to start it. The source of my distraction varied\u2014I would constantly check my email, read random documentation, or even scroll through my social feeds. But the result was the same: I felt a deep sense of dread that I was not making progress on the things that mattered.</p><p>At the end of the day, time is the only resource that matters. With every minute, you are making a decision about how to spend your life. Most of the ways people spend their time are ineffective. Especially in the tech world, our tasks and tools are constantly changing, so we must be able to adapt. What separates the best engineers from the rest of the pack is that they create systems that allow them to be consistently productive.</p><p>Here\u2019s the core idea that changed my perspective on productivity: Action leads to motivation, not the other way around. You should not check your email or scroll Instagram while you wait for motivation to \u201chit you.\u201d Instead, just start doing something, anything, that makes progress toward your goal, and you\u2019ll find that motivation will follow.\u2026</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/getting-past-procastination\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/improving-interview-odds\" target=\"_blank\">2. Improve Your Chances of Landing That Job Interview</a></h2><p>One of my close friends is a hiring manager at Google. She recently posted about an open position on her team and was immediately overwhelmed with applications. We\u2019re talking about thousands of applicants within days.</p><p>What surprised me most, however, was the horrendous quality of the average submission. Most applicants were obviously unqualified or had concocted entirely fake profiles. The use of generative AI to automatically fill out (and, in some cases, even submit) applications is harmful to everyone; employers are unable to filter through the noise, and legitimate candidates have a harder time getting noticed\u2014much less advancing to an interview.</p><p>So how can job seekers stand out among the deluge of candidates? When there are hundreds or thousands of applicants, the best way to distinguish yourself is by leveraging your network.</p><p>With AI, anyone with a computer can trivially apply to thousands of jobs. On the other hand, people are restricted by Dunbar\u2019s number\u2014the idea that humans can maintain stable social relationships with only about 150 people. Being one of those 150 people is harder, but it also carries more weight than a soulless job application.</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/improving-interview-odds\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/learning-coding-age-of-ai\" target=\"_blank\">3.

That\u2019s one billion lines of production-grade code accepted by users every single day. If we generously assume that a strong engineer writes a thousand lines of code in a day, Cursor is doing the equivalent work of a million developers. (For context, while working at Pinterest and Meta, I\u2019d typically write less than 100 lines of code per day.)</p><p>There are only about 25 million software developers worldwide! Naively, it appears that Cursor is making a meaningful percentage of coders obsolete.</p><p>This begs the question: Is it even worth learning to code anymore?</p><p>The answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The above fear-based analysis of Cursor misses several important points.\u2026</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/learning-coding-age-of-ai\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>. </em></em></p><p>\u2014Rahul<br /></p>"

These memory chips are placed as close as possible to the computing chips they serve in order to cut down on the biggest bottleneck in AI computing\u2014the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trillion-transistor-gpu\" target=\"_blank\">energy and delay</a> in getting billions of bits per second from memory into logic. But what if you could bring computing and memory even closer together by stacking the HBM on top of the GPU?</span></p><p> Imec recently explored this scenario using advanced thermal simulations, and the answer\u2014delivered in December at the <a href=\"https://www.ieee-iedm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 IEEE International Electron Device Meeting</a> (IEDM)\u2014was a bit grim. 3D stacking doubles the operating temperature inside the GPU, rendering it inoperable. But the team, led by Imec\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-myers-3163a1143/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">James Myers</a>, didn\u2019t just give up. They identified several engineering optimizations that ultimately could whittle down the temperature difference to nearly zero.</p><h2>2.5D and 3D Advanced Packaging</h2><p>Imec started with a thermal simulation of a GPU and four HBM dies as you\u2019d find them today, inside what\u2019s called a 2.5D package. That is, both the GPU and the HBM sit on substrate called an interposer, with minimal distance between them. The two types of chips are linked by thousands of micrometer-scale copper interconnects built into the interposer\u2019s surface. In this configuration, the model GPU consumes 414 watts and reaches a peak temperature of just under 70 \u00b0C\u2014typical for a processor. The memory chips consume an additional 40 W or so and get somewhat less hot. The heat is removed from the top of the package by the kind of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">liquid cooling </a>that\u2019s become common in new AI data centers.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_blank\">Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever</a></p><p>\u201cWhile this approach is currently used, it does not scale well for the future\u2014especially as it blocks two sides of the GPU, limiting future GPU-to-GPU connections inside the package,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yukai-chen-88948675/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukai Chen</a>, a senior researcher at Imec, told engineers at IEDM. In contrast, \u201cthe 3D approach leads to higher bandwidth, lower latency.\u2026 The most important improvement is the package footprint.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, as Chen and his colleagues found, the most straightforward version of stacking, simply putting the HBM chips on top of the GPU and adding a block of blank silicon to fill in a gap at the center, shot up temperatures in the GPU to a scorching 140 \u00b0C\u2014well past a typical GPU\u2019s 80 \u00b0C limit.</p><h2>System Technology Co-optimization</h2><p>The Imec team set about trying a number of technology and system optimizations aimed at lowering the temperature. The first thing they tried was throwing out a layer of silicon that was now redundant. To understand why, you have to first get a grip on what HBM really is.</p><p>This form of memory is a stack of as many as 12 high-density DRAM dies. Each has been thinned down to tens of micrometers and is shot through with vertical connections. These thinned dies are stacked one atop another and connected by tiny<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_blank\"> balls of solder</a>, and this stack of memory is vertically connected to another piece of silicon, called the base die. The base die is a logic chip designed to multiplex the data\u2014pack it into the limited number of wires that can fit across the millimeter-scale gap to the GPU.</p><p>But with the HBM now on top of the GPU, there\u2019s no need for such a data pump. Bits can flow directly into the processor without regard for how many wires happen to fit along the side of the chip. Of course, this change means moving the memory control circuits from the base die into the GPU and therefore changing the processor\u2019s floorplan, says Myers. But there should be ample room, he suggests, because the GPU will no longer need the circuits used to demultiplex incoming memory data.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/keeping-chips-cool/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hot, Hot Future of Chips</a></p><p>Cutting out this middleman of memory cooled things down by only a little less than 4 \u00b0C. But, importantly, it should massively boost the bandwidth between the memory and the processor, which is important for another optimization the team tried\u2014slowing down the GPU.</p><p>That might seem contrary to the whole purpose of better AI computing, but in this case, it\u2019s an advantage. Large language models are what are called \u201cmemory-bound\u201d problems. That is, memory bandwidth is the main limiting factor. But Myers\u2019s team estimated 3D stacking HBM on the GPU would boost bandwidth fourfold. With that added headroom, even slowing the GPU\u2019s clock by 50 percent still leads to a performance win, while cooling everything down by more than 20 \u00b0C. In practice, the processor might not need to be slowed down quite that much. Increasing the clock frequency to 70 percent led to a GPU that was only 1.7 \u00b0C warmer, Myers says.</p><h2>Optimized HBM</h2><p>Another big drop in temperature came from making the HBM stack and the area around it more conductive. That included merging the four stacks into two wider stacks, thereby eliminating a heat-trapping region; thinning out the top\u2014usually thicker\u2014die of the stack; and filling in more of the space around the HBM with blank pieces of silicon to conduct more heat.</p><p>With all of that, the stack now operated at about 88 \u00b0C. One final optimization brought things back to near 70 \u00b0C. Generally, some 95 percent of a chip\u2019s heat is removed from the top of the package, where in this case water carries the heat away. But adding similar cooling to the underside as well drove the stacked chips down a final 17 \u00b0C.</p><p>Although the research presented at IEDM shows it might be possible, HBM-on-GPU isn\u2019t necessarily the best choice, Myers says. \u201cWe are simulating other system configurations to help build confidence that this is or isn\u2019t the best choice,\u201d he says. \u201cGPU-on-HBM is of interest to some in industry,\u201d because it puts the GPU closer to the cooling. But it would likely be a more complex design, because the GPU\u2019s power and data would have to flow vertically through the HBM to reach it.</p>"

For decades, engineers have sought OLEDs that can bend, twist, and stretch while maintaining bright and stable light. These displays could be integrated into a new class of devices\u2014woven into clothing fabric, for example, to show real-time information, like a runner\u2019s speed or heart rate, without breaking or dimming.</p><p>But engineers have always encountered a trade-off: The more you stretch these materials, the dimmer they become. Now, a group co-led by <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/G/gogotsi-yury/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yury Gogotsi</a>, a materials scientist at Drexel University in Philadelphia, has found a way around the problem by employing a special class of materials called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-mxenese-matter\" target=\"_self\">MXenes</a>\u2014which Gogotsi helped discover\u2014that maintain brightness while being significantly stretched.</p><p>The team developed an OLED that can stretch to twice its original size while keeping a steady glow. It also converts electricity into light more efficiently than any stretchable OLED before it, reaching a record 17 percent external quantum efficiency\u2014a measure of how efficiently a device turns electricity into light.</p><h2>The \u201cPerfect Replacement\u201d</h2><p>Gogotsi didn\u2019t have much experience with OLEDs when, about five years ago, he teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.pnel.snu.ac.kr/professor-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tae-Woo Lee</a>, a materials scientist at Seoul National University, to develop better flexible OLEDs, driven by the ever-increasing use of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/from-foldable-phones-to-stretchy-screens\" target=\"_self\">flexible electronics</a> like foldable phones.</p><p>Traditionally, the displays are built from multiple stacked layers. At the base, a cathode supplies electrons that enter the adjacent organic layers, which are designed to conduct this charge efficiently. As the electrons move through these layers, they meet positive charge injected by an indium tin oxide (ITO) film. The moment these charges combine, the organic material releases energy as light, creating the illuminated pixels that make up the image. The entire structure is sealed with a glass layer on top.</p><p>The ITO film\u2014adhered to the glass\u2014serves as the anode, allowing current to pass through the organic layers without blocking the generated light. \u201cBut it\u2019s brittle. It\u2019s ceramic, basically,\u201d so it works well for flat surfaces, but can\u2019t be bent, Gogotsi explains. There have been attempts to engineer flexible OLEDs many times before, but they failed to meaningfully overcome both flexibility and brightness limitations.</p><p>Gogotsi\u2019s students started by creating a transparent, conducting film out of a MXene, a type of ultrathin and flexible material with metal-like conductivity. The material is unique in its inherent ability to bend because it\u2019s made from many two-dimensional sheets that can slide relative to each other without breaking. The film\u2014only 10 nanometers thick\u2014\u201cappeared to be this perfect replacement for ITO,\u201d Gogotsi says. </p><p>Through experimentation, Gogotsi and Lee\u2019s shared team found that a mix of the MXene and silver nanowire would actually stretch the most while maintaining stability. \u201cWe were able to double the size, achieving 200 percent stretching without losing performance,\u201d Gogotsi says. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A bi-axially twisted exciplex-assisted phosphorescent film deposited on a small stretchable substrate.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2a744\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-bi-axially-twisted-exciplex-assisted-phosphorescent-film-deposited-on-a-small-stretchable-substrate.jpg?id=62303071&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The new material can also be twisted without losing its glow.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Source image: Huanyu Zhou, Hyun-Wook Kim, et al.</small></p><p>And the new MXene film was not only more flexible than ITO but also increased brightness by almost an order of magnitude by making the contact between the topmost light-emitting organic layer and the film more efficient. </p><p>Unlike ITO, the surface of MXenes can be chemically adjusted to make it easier for electrons to move from the electrode into the light-emitting layer. This more efficient electron flow significantly increases the brightness of the display, as evidenced by an external quantum efficiency of 17 percent, which the group claims is a record for stretchable OLEDs.</p><p>\u201cAchieving those numbers in intrinsically stretchable OLEDs under substantial stretching is quite significant,\u201d says <a href=\"https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/professor/12225/\" target=\"_blank\">Seunghyup Yoo</a>, who runs the Integrated Organic Electronics Laboratory at South Korea\u2019s KAIST. An external quantum efficiency of 20 percent is an important benchmark for this kind of device because it is the upper limit of efficiency dictated by the physical properties of light generation, Yoo explains.</p><p>To increase illumination, the researchers went beyond working with MXene. Lee\u2019s group developed two additional organic layers to add into the middle of their OLED\u2014one that directs positive charges to the light-emitting layer, ensuring that electricity is used more efficiently, and one that recycles wasted energy that would normally be lost, boosting overall brightness.</p><p>Together, the MXene layer and two organic layers allow for a notably bright and stable OLED, even when stretched. Gogotsi thinks the subsequent OLED is \u201cvery successful\u201d because it combines both brightness and stretchability, while, historically, engineers have only been able to achieve one or the other. </p><p>\u201cThe performance that they are able to achieve in this work is an important advancement,\u201d says <a href=\"https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/sihong-wang\" target=\"_blank\">Sihong Wang</a>, a molecular engineer at the University of Chicago who also develops stretchable OLED materials. Wang also notes that the 200 percent stretchability that Gogotsi\u2019s group attained is beyond robust for wearable applications.</p><h2>Wearables and Health Care</h2><p>A stretchable OLED that maintains its brightness has uses in many settings, including industrial environments, robotics, wearable clothing and devices, and communications, Gogotsi says, although he\u2019s most excited about its adoption in health-monitoring devices. He sees a near future in which displays for diagnostics and treatment become embedded in clothing or \u201cepidermal electronics,\u201d comparing their function to smartwatches. </p><p>Before these displays can come to market, however, stability issues inherent to all stretchable OLEDs need to be solved, Wang says. Current materials are not able to sustain light emissions for long enough to serve customers in the ways they require. </p><p>Finding housings to protect them is also a problem. \u201cYou need a stretchable encapsulation material that can protect the central device without allowing oxygen and moisture to permeate,\u201d Wang says.</p><p>Yoo agrees: He says it\u2019s a tough problem to solve because the best protective layers are rigid and not very stretchable. He notes yet another challenge in the way of commercialization, which is \u201cdeveloping stretchable displays that do not exhibit image distortion.\u201d</p><p>Regardless, Gogotsi is excited about the future of stretchable OLEDs. \u201cWe started with computers occupying the room, then moved to our desktops, then to laptops, then we got smartphones and iPads, but still we carry stuff with us,\u201d he says. \u201cFlexible displays can be on the sleeve of your jacket. They can be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rollable-smartphone\" target=\"_self\">rolled into a tube</a> or folded and put in your pocket. They can be everywhere.\u201d</p>"

Overview plans to launch satellites into geosynchronous orbit (GEO) to collect unfiltered solar energy where the sun never sets and then beam this abundance back to humanity.

A beam with low power density is safer because it\u2019s not blasting too much concentrated energy onto a single spot on the Earth\u2019s surface, but it\u2019s less efficient for the task of delivering usable solar energy. A higher-density beam does the job better, but then the researchers must engineer some way to maintain safety.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Startup Overview Energy demonstrates how space-based solar power could be beamed to Earth from satellites.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Overview Energy</small></p><h2>Space-Based Solar Power Makes Waves</h2><p><span></span>Many researchers have settled on microwaves as their beam of choice for wireless power. But, in addition to the safety concerns about shooting such intense waves at the Earth, Jaffe says there\u2019s another problem: Microwaves are part of what he calls the \u201cbeachfront property\u201d of the electromagnetic spectrum\u2014a range from 2 to 20 gigahertz that is set aside for many other applications, such as 5G cellular networks. </p><p>\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Jaffe says, \u201cif you somehow magically had a fully operational solar power satellite that used microwave power transmission in orbit today\u2014and a multi-kilometer-scale microwave power satellite receiver on the ground magically in place today\u2014you could not turn it on because the spectrum is not allocated to do this kind of transmission.\u201d</p><p>Instead, Overview plans to use less-dense, wide-field infrared waves. Existing utility-scale solar farms would be able to receive the beamed energy just like they receive the sun\u2019s energy during daylight hours. So \u201cyour receivers are already built,\u201d Berte says. The next major step is a prototype demonstrator for low Earth orbit, after which he hopes to have GEO satellites beaming megawatts of power by 2030 and gigawatts by later that decade.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/space-based-solar-power-2667878868\" target=\"_self\">Plenty of doubts</a> about the feasibility of space-based power abound. It is an exotic technology with much left to prove, including the ability to survive orbital debris and the exorbitant cost of launching the power stations. (Overview\u2019s satellite will be built on Earth in a folded configuration, and it will unfold after it\u2019s brought to orbit, according to the company.)</p><p>\u201cGetting down the cost per unit mass for launch is a big deal,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cThen, it just becomes a question of increasing the specific power. A lot of the technologies we\u2019re working on at Overview are squarely focused on that.\u201d</p>"

The new platform, set to reach customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to train certain models, as compared to Nvidia\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-blackwell\" target=\"_self\">Blackwell</a> architecture. </p><p>The usual suspect for improved performance is the GPU. Indeed, the new Rubin GPU boasts 50 quadrillion floating-point operations per second (petaFLOPS) of 4-bit computation, as compared to 10 petaflops on Blackwell, at least for transformer-based inference workloads like large language models.</p><p>However, focusing on just the GPU misses the bigger picture. There are a total of six new chips in the Vera Rubin-based computers: the Vera CPU, the Rubin GPU, and four distinct networking chips. To achieve performance advantages, the components have to work in concert, says <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/author/giladshainer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gilad Shainer</a>, senior vice president of networking at Nvidia.</p><p>\u201cThe same unit connected in a different way will deliver a completely different level of performance,\u201d Shainer says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we call it extreme co-design.\u201d</p><h2>Expanded \u201cin-network compute\u201d</h2><p>AI workloads, both training and inference, run on large numbers of GPUs simultaneously. \u201cTwo years back, inferencing was mainly run on a single GPU, a single box, a single server,\u201d Shainer says. \u201cRight now, inferencing is becoming distributed, and it\u2019s not just in a rack. It\u2019s going to go across racks.\u201d</p><p>To accommodate these hugely distributed tasks, as many GPUs as possible need to effectively work as one. This is the aim of the so-called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rf-over-fiber\" target=\"_blank\">scale-up network</a>: the connection of GPUs within a single rack. Nvidia handles this connection with their NVLink networking chip. The new line includes the NVLink6 switch, with double the bandwidth of the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/\" target=\"_blank\">previous version</a><a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a> (3,600 gigabytes per second for GPU-to-GPU connections, as compared to 1,800 GB/s for the NVLink5 switch).</p><p>In addition to the bandwidth doubling, the scale-up chips also include double the number of SerDes\u2014serializer/deserializers (which allow data to be sent across fewer wires)\u2014and an expanded number of calculations that can be done within the network.</p><p>\u201cThe scale-up network is not really the network itself,\u201d Shainer says. \u201cIt\u2019s computing infrastructure, and some of the computing operations are done on the network\u2026on the switch.\u201d</p><p>The rationale for offloading some operations from the GPUs to the network is twofold. First, it allows some tasks to only be done once, rather than having every GPU have to perform them. A common example of this is the all-reduce operation in AI training. During training, each GPU computes a mathematical operation, called a gradient, on its own batch of data. In order to train the model correctly, all the GPUs need to know the average gradient computed across all batches. Rather than each GPU sending its gradient to every other GPU, and every one of them computing the average, it saves computational time and power for that operation to only happen once, within the network.</p><p>A second rationale is to hide the time it takes to shuttle data in between GPUs by doing computations on them en route. Shainer explains this via an analogy of a pizza parlor trying to speed up the time it takes to deliver an order. \u201cWhat can you do if you had more ovens or more workers? It doesn\u2019t help you; you can make more pizzas, but the time for a single pizza is going to stay the same. Alternatively, if you would take the oven and put it in a car, so I\u2019m going to bake the pizza while traveling to you, this is where I save time. This is what we do.\u201d</p><p>In-network computing is not new to this iteration of Nvidia\u2019s architecture. In fact, it has been in common use since around 2016. But, this iteration adds a broader swath of computations that can be done within the network to accommodate different workloads and different numerical formats, Shainer says.</p><h2>Scaling out and across</h2><p>The rest of the networking chips included in the Rubin architecture comprise the so-called scale-out network. This is the part that connects different racks to each other within the data center.</p><p>Those <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">chips</a> are the ConnectX-9, a networking interface card; the BlueField-4 a so-called data processing unit, which is paired with two Vera CPUs and a ConnectX-9 card for offloading networking, storage, and security tasks; and finally the Spectrum-6 Ethernet switch, which uses <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_self\">co-packaged optics</a> to send data between racks. The Ethernet switch also doubles the bandwidth of the previous generations while minimizing jitter\u2014the variation in arrival times of information packets.</p><p>\u201cScale-out infrastructure needs to make sure that those GPUs can communicate well in order to run a distributed computing workload, and that means I need a network that has no jitter in it,\u201d he says. The presence of jitter implies that if different racks are doing different parts of the calculation, the answer from each will arrive at different times. One rack will always be slower than the rest, and the rest of the racks, full of costly equipment, sit idle while waiting for that last packet. \u201cJitter means losing money,\u201d Shainer says.</p><p>None of Nvidia\u2019s host of new chips are specifically dedicated to connect between data centers, termed \u201cscale-across.\u201d But Shainer argues this is the next frontier. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop here, because we are seeing the demands to increase the number of GPUs in a data center,\u201d he says. \u201c100,000 GPUs is not enough anymore for some workloads, and now we need to connect multiple data centers together.\u201d</p>"
