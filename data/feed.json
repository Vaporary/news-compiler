In a model with realistic risk premia, nominal rigidities, and an intermediary sector, calibrated to the U.S., we estimate this threshold at 189%. We highlight the roles of safety premia and intermediation-driven convenience yields. The threshold varies with the source of surpluses: spending cuts reduce inflation and allow low interest rates, while tax increases distort labor supply and raise inflation. Uncertainty over the austerity regime\u2014spending cuts or tax increases\u2014sharply lowers fiscal capacity. The expected austerity regime affects asset prices and macro outcomes even when debt-to-GDP is well below the threshold."

To demonstrate the framework\u2019s full potential, we extend the benchmark human survey (10 waves, 2018\u20132023) to over 50 waves dating back to 1990. We further examine the economic mechanisms underlying agents\u2019 expectation formation, identifying the mean-reversion and individual-attention channels. Finally, we trace dynamic treatment effects and demonstrate clean identification. Together, these innovations demonstrate that LLM surveys enable research designs unattainable with human surveys."

Leveraging nearly 75 years of economist survey data on real GDP growth expectations, we identify economic states while sidestepping model-driven forecast error. GDP forecasts comove with consumption and predict the market return, real GDP growth, and consumption growth. This approach builds on the literatures on both the Intertemporal and Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Models. We document a statistically significant, economically meaningful procyclicality premium that remains robust to standard factor controls."

        "summary": "This paper simulates economic developments as if the discretionary fiscal stimulus enacted in the past two recessions had not occurred and additional automatic fiscal stabilizers had been deployed instead. For the calibration of key economic relationships most consistent with the empirical literature, we find that more sustained fiscal stimulus would have pushed unemployment down more rapidly following the Great Recession and that more limited stimulus would have caused inflation to increase much less following the COVID recession. We caution, though, that our estimates are uncertain given the large number of assumptions embedded in the calculations. Under different assumptions about the supply side of the economy when resource utilization is high, the stimulus enacted in early 2021 was not a significant cause of the observed runup in inflation that followed, and substituting an automatic stabilizer would have made little difference to inflation."

AI is making warfare more precise and deadly amidst intransigent conflicts. AI companies are exploiting people in the global South who work as data labelers, and profiting from content creators worldwide by using their work without license or compensation. The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" target=\"_blank\">enormous energy demands</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, particularly in the United States, public investment in science seems to be <a href=\"https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/leading-research-universities-report/white-house-proposes-steep-cuts-science-and-education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>redirected</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/trump-plan-highlights-ai-for-science\" target=\"_blank\">concentrated</a> on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And Big Tech companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.</p><p>This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here\u2019s how.</p><h2>The Academy\u2019s View of AI <a target=\"_blank\"></a></h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Pew study</span></a> in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn\u2019t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 <a href=\"https://sci-ops.org/survey/artificial-intelligence-survey-x/scientists-perceptions-and-personal-use/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of generative AI in daily life\u2014by nearly a three to one ratio.</p><p>We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, cybersecurity, physical sciences, drug discovery, public health, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we\u2019ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we\u2019ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.</p><p>We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.</p><h2>Elements of a Positive Vision for AI</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/working-waterfront/hope-a-framework-for-climate-action/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7178677/climate-scientist-optimist-refuse-to-give-up-hope/\" target=\"_blank\">have</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">rgu</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">ed</a> <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that</a> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">turn</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ing</a> the <a href=\"https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/making-case-climate-optimism\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tide</a> of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.</p><p>There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples\u2019 lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.</p><p>Some examples: AI is eliminating communication barriers across languages, including under-resourced contexts like <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5230744\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>marginalized sign languages</span></a> and <a href=\"https://ojs.bilpub.com/index.php/card/article/view/517\" target=\"_blank\">indigenous African languages</a>. It is helping policymakers incorporate the viewpoints of many constituents through AI-assisted <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adq2852\" target=\"_blank\">deliberations</a> and <a href=\"https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legislative engagement</a>.

National labs are building AI <a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/cels/auroragpt-foundation-models-for-science\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">foundation models</a> to accelerate scientific research. And throughout the fields of medicine and biology, machine learning is solving scientific problems like the prediction of protein structure in aid of drug discovery, which was recognized with a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Prize</a> in 2024.</p><p>While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.</p><h2><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>A Call to Action for Scientists</h2><p>In our new book, <span><em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\">Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship</a></em></span><span>, we describe four key actions for policymakers committed to steering AI toward the public good.</span></p><p>These apply to scientists as well. Researchers should work to <strong>reform</strong> the AI industry to be more ethical, equitable, and trustworthy. We must collectively<a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"><span>develop</span></a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\">ethical</a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\">norms</a> for research that advance and applies AI, and should use and draw attention to AI developers who adhere to those norms. </p><p>Second, we should <strong>resist</strong> harmful uses of AI by documenting the negative applications of AI and casting a light on inappropriate uses. </p><p>Third, we should <strong>responsibly use</strong> AI to make society and peoples\u2019 lives better, exploiting its capabilities to help the communities they serve. </p><p>And finally, we must advocate for the <strong>renovation</strong> of institutions to prepare them for the impacts of AI; universities, professional societies, and democratic organizations are all vulnerable to disruption.</p><p>Scientists have a special privilege and responsibility: We are close to the technology itself and therefore well positioned to influence its trajectory. We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Melvin Kranzberg observed</span></a>, \u201cis neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today.

Within the next 24 hours, the balloons were able to enter the hurricane and release their dropsondes to measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, along with wind speed and direction\u2014information that potentially could have helped forecasters determine exactly how the hurricane would behave.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A close-up shows a small black device in a plastic bag.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"51a2b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-close-up-shows-a-small-black-device-in-a-plastic-bag.jpg?id=61772142&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The sensors that collect weather data for each Global Sounding Balloon are encased in plastic.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Christie Hemm Klok </small></p><p>This dropsonde deployment, the first ever by weather balloon, demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to release airborne sensors without the usual costs and risks to human life. And when our team ran the collected data through our AI-based forecasting model, WeatherMesh, its predictions of Milton\u2019s path were more accurate than those from the <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. National Hurricane Center</a>. Alas, because our dropsonde launch was an experiment meant to test our technology\u2019s capabilities, the results we obtained couldn\u2019t be disseminated to the public in real time. But it was nevertheless a great accomplishment: WindBorne proved definitively that AI forecasts can outperform the kind of weather models our society has relied on for decades.</p><p>Our mission at WindBorne is to build what we liken to a \u201cplanetary nervous system\u201d\u2014an end-to-end AI-based forecasting system that can gather vast amounts of weather data and transform that data into accurate and timely forecasts. Just as a person\u2019s nervous system constantly sends information from all parts of the body to the brain, our planetary nervous system gathers observations from all over the Earth and sends them to our AI brain.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Our system, which requires both advanced data-collection hardware and sophisticated AI modeling, can radically improve how people use weather predictions to make decisions in areas such as national defense, renewable energy, and agriculture. With <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">climate change</a> increasing the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/weather-climate\" target=\"_blank\">frequency</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/257054/climate-change-behind-almost-half-cost/\" target=\"_blank\">cost</a> of extreme weather events like Milton, we hope to provide better forecasts to help society navigate this new reality.</p><h2>WindBorne\u2019s Stanford Origins</h2><p>WindBorne started as a 2015 project in the <a href=\"https://www.stanfordssi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Student Space Initiative</a>, when Andrey Sushko (now WindBorne\u2019s CTO) and some other students became interested in extending the flight duration of conventional weather balloons. Most weather balloons burst after just a couple of hours in flight, collecting data for only a single up-down cycle as they ascend, pop, and then drop back down to the ground. These balloons almost never go far beyond their continental launch sites, leaving the air above oceans, deserts, and other remote regions underobserved. That\u2019s problematic because weather is global: A disturbance that starts near the west coast of Africa can develop into the next catastrophic storm to hit North America.</p><p>While working on the project, we discovered that the flight limitations of conventional weather balloons mean that they\u2019re observing only about 15 percent of the globe. We realized that if we improved the hardware and control systems, we could create weather balloons that self-navigate and intelligently \u201csurf\u201d the wind, allowing them to stay aloft much longer than conventional balloons\u2014think weeks instead of hours.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A young man in a black t-shirt stands in front of a large machine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a4dbc\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-man-in-a-black-t-shirt-stands-in-front-of-a-large-machine.jpg?id=61772455&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">John Dean cofounded WindBorne in 2019.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Jason Henry/The New York Times/Redux        </small></p><p>I cofounded the company in 2019 with four of my peers from Stanford, and later took on the role of CEO. At that time, we were still in the early R&amp;D stages for our balloons. The result of that work was a design for autonomous, long-duration balloons that communicate with operators via satellite. In 2024, we introduced our first AI forecasting model, WeatherMesh, to ingest the data from the balloons and give them high-level instructions on where to fly next to fill in specific data gaps.</p><p>The main envelope of a WindBorne balloon is made from a thin, transparent film just 20 micrometers thick\u2014less than half the thickness of a human hair\u2014and the whole assembly weighs less than 2 kilograms. Each balloon has a bag of sand used as ballast; the balloon can release sand to rise higher or vent gas to descend to a different wind current. Each balloon\u2019s onboard autonomous system plots how to use the winds at different elevations to reach the locations specified by its WeatherMesh instructions.</p><p>Our GSBs, which collect orders of magnitude more data than single-use dropsondes, make up <a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/products/observations\" target=\"_blank\">Atlas</a>, our global constellation. Today, our GSBs can fly for well over 50 days at altitudes ranging from ground level up to around 24 kilometers. Atlas, which typically has hundreds of balloons in the air at any time, collects more in situ data each day than the balloons managed by the U.S. National Weather Service.</p><p>Following our time at Stanford, the WindBorne team built a business by scaling our Atlas constellation and providing weather data as a service. At first, the balloons\u2019 navigation was guided by results from a traditional numerical weather-prediction model that ran on a supercomputer. But running that model required hundreds of times as much computing power as AI weather models do. As our constellation proved capable of collecting vast amounts of data, we knew we needed to build a model that could not only efficiently direct our balloon constellation but also assimilate its massive datasets.</p><h2>The Limitations of Traditional Forecast Methods</h2><p>Currently, most weather forecasts rely on physics-based <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/numerical-weather-prediction\" target=\"_blank\">numerical weather prediction</a>. In the United States, this job is handled by the federal government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast\" target=\"_blank\">Global Forecast System</a> (GFS), which ingests data from satellites, ground stations, radar systems, and a worldwide network of conventional weather balloons. It runs on a supercomputer four times a day, using a technique called data assimilation to produce forecasts that extend up to 16 days out. Data assimilation interprets new data alongside historical data to come up with the most accurate forecast possible.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man stands on a beach next to a large metal apparatus mounted on a tripod. The apparatus includes a long rod with a large ring on the end. A large plastic balloon is attached to the ring and is partially filled with air. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ede55\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-stands-on-a-beach-next-to-a-large-metal-apparatus-mounted-on-a-tripod-the-apparatus-includes-a-long-rod-with-a-large-ring.jpg?id=61779480&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">For the launch, the balloon is mounted on a ring that\u2019s aligned with the wind. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Christie Hemm Klok </small></p><p>But therein lies the problem: Forecasting models are only as accurate as the data they are fed. With much of the global atmosphere not being regularly probed by balloons, current forecasts are hamstrung by the sparseness of the datasets available to them. You\u2019ve probably seen a hurricane\u2019s forecast cone shift dramatically from one day to the next. That volatility comes in part from the incomplete data driving these models. What\u2019s more, physics-based models require enormous computing resources, which translate into high operational costs.</p><p>Over the last few years, AI models have disrupted weather forecasting, proving that they can generate faster, less costly, and more accurate predictions when compared with the prior gold standard of physics-based numerical weather models. When the Chinese company Huawei introduced its <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3\" target=\"_blank\">Pangu-Weather</a> model in 2023, it served notice that AI forecasting could not only compete with physics-based models, but it could even outperform them. Other recent AI weather models include Google DeepMind\u2019s <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/\" target=\"_blank\">GraphCast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ecmwf.int/en/newsletter/178/news/aifs-new-ecmwf-forecasting-system\" target=\"_blank\">AIFS</a> from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. But our system <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/14/2024/windborne-takes-the-ai-weather-prediction-crown\" target=\"_blank\">outperforms</a> all of them, sometimes by a very large measure.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man observing a clear plastic balloon attached to a tripod on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"44883\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-observing-a-clear-plastic-balloon-attached-to-a-tripod-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780018&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Person launches a clear balloon with tripod apparatus on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"51f93\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-launches-a-clear-balloon-with-tripod-apparatus-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780015&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man with a clear plastic balloon standing on a beach on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4fe4a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-with-a-clear-plastic-balloon-standing-on-a-beach-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780012&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man launches a clear plastic balloon on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5c703\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-launches-a-clear-plastic-balloon-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780011&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A screenshot showing the balloon's location and its sensor readings. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fd56b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-showing-the-balloon-s-location-and-its-sensor-readings.jpg?id=61780009&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The balloon is initially doubled up [top] to make it more maneuverable before launch.

For starters, all AI models are trained on historical weather data and predictions produced by conventional systems. Without them, the model would have to rely on raw, real-time observations for training data, without historical context.</p><p>AI models also inherently lack an advanced understanding of physics, so traditional models provide a baseline to ensure that AI-generated predictions are physically plausible. This assistance is especially important during extreme weather events, when physics-based models can help AI models simulate rare conditions based on atmospheric principles.</p><h2>How We Built our AI Weather-Forecasting Model</h2><p>When the WindBorne team set out to build the initial version of WeatherMesh, we had three main goals. First, it had to be inexpensive to run. Second, it needed to be at least as accurate as the top physics-based models. Third, it had to deliver forecasts with a high spatial resolution, providing fine-grained predictions on the scale of tens of kilometers.</p><p>We decided to use an architecture based on what are called transformers\u2014the same technology that powers large language models like ChatGPT\u2014because transformers can process huge datasets efficiently once they\u2019re trained. This architecture includes what AI mavens refer to as an encoder-processor-decoder structure. The encoder transforms raw weather data\u2014things like temperature, wind, and pressure\u2014into a simpler compressed format known as latent space, where patterns are easier for the model to work with. The processor then runs calculations in this latent space to predict how the weather will change over time. To create longer-range forecasts, we simply run the processor step multiple times, with the output of the last prediction step serving as the input for the next. Finally, the decoder translates the results back into real-world weather variables.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A photo from a manufacturing facility shows dozens of long plastic bags hanging from hooks.

Setting up our own machines paid off. The hardware set us back about $100,000, but had we run all our training experiments in the cloud instead, it easily would have cost four times as much.</p><p>The first version of WeatherMesh was smaller, faster, and cheaper to operate than the AI weather models created by tech giants. During training, it used about one-fifteenth the computing power of DeepMind\u2019s GraphCast and one-tenth that of Huawei\u2019s Pangu-Weather. Its small size makes its stellar performance all the more notable: It outperformed both those AI models and traditional physics-based models.</p><p>The early accuracy gains of WeatherMesh can be attributed to our data-collection method. Our GSBs collect 30 to 50 times as much data as do conventional balloons, and we feed that data directly into WeatherMesh. We measured our model\u2019s accuracy based on frequency of errors when compared with other physics- and AI-based models. In 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/14/2024/windborne-takes-the-ai-weather-prediction-crown\" target=\"_blank\">beat</a> both Huawei\u2019s Pangu-Weather and DeepMind\u2019s GraphCast to become the most accurate AI forecasting model in the world. At the time this article is being published, in October 2025, WeatherMesh retains the lead.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A close-up shows a woman assembling electronic components.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e99a7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-close-up-shows-a-woman-assembling-electronic-components.jpg?id=61886030&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Each balloon has an antenna that enables it to communicate via satellite. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Christie Hemm Klok </small></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man sitting at a table uses a tool to assemble electronic components.

Today, WeatherMesh also includes a component that can provide forecasts for selected locations at a resolution of about 1 km.</p><p>Most AI weather models train on historical datasets like ERA5, which organizes decades of atmospheric data into a consistent framework. But we also wanted WeatherMesh to run \u201clive,\u201d ingesting real-time balloon observations and up-to-date analyses from the U.S. and European agencies. That transition was challenging, because most AI models perform worse when they shift from carefully curated historical data to messy real-world feeds.</p><p>To address this issue, we built specialized adapters based on a type of neural-network architecture known as U-Net, which excels at learning spatial features across different scales. These adapters translate real-time data into the same internal format used for WeatherMesh\u2019s training data. In this way we preserved the benefits of training on ERA5 while still delivering accurate real-time forecasts.</p><h2>Building On Success With WeatherMesh-4</h2><p><span>Following the success of our initial WeatherMesh model, we released the </span><a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/windborne-breaks-new-ai-forecasting-records-with-weathermesh-2-model-surpassing-ai-and-physics-gold-standards\" target=\"_blank\">second</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/weathermesh-3-fast-and-accurate-operational-global-weather-forecasting\" target=\"_blank\">third</a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/weathermesh-4-technical-blog\" target=\"_blank\">fourth</a><span> versions of the model in rapid succession. WeatherMesh-4 predicts standard atmospheric variables at 25 vertical levels throughout the atmosphere. It also predicts a wide range of conditions at the surface, including temperature and dewpoint at 2 meters from the ground, wind speed at 10 meters and 100 meters, minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, solar radiation, and total cloud cover. It can produce a full forecast every 10 minutes based on the latest observations. In contrast, traditional global weather models update every 6 hours.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man stands by a large machine, over which is stretched a thin sheet of translucent plastic.

Our balloon constellation can\u2019t afford to wait 12 hours for a new forecast; it needs near-constant refreshes to navigate the skies. Meanwhile, the AI model uses fresh atmospheric data from the balloons to improve the accuracy of its forecasts. Balancing these requirements forced us to get creative about how we moved the data and ran the model, but ultimately we produced a powerful system that\u2019s fast and responsive.</p><h2>What\u2019s Next for WindBorne</h2><p>In the coming years, our goal is to expand our Atlas balloon constellation to about 10,000 GSBs flying at any time, launched from about 30 sites worldwide. To achieve that goal we\u2019ll need roughly 300 launches per day, or 9,000 per month. By 2028, we believe the entire globe could be under near-continuous observation by Atlas, from the remote Pacific to the polar ice caps. And we continue to test the boundaries of what is possible: WindBorne recently kept a balloon aloft for a record-breaking 104 days.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man standing in a field holds a big round white balloon over his head.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"246f5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-standing-in-a-field-holds-a-big-round-white-balloon-over-his-head.jpg?id=61772459&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Traditional weather balloons stay aloft for only a few hours and don\u2019t go far from their launch sites.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Annie Mulligan/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images        </small> </p><p>We\u2019re not aiming to make physics-based weather models obsolete. We see a future where AI and traditional methods operate side by side, each reinforcing the other. Governments, researchers, and corporations can lean on these improved forecasts to guide disaster preparedness, aviation, supply-chain logistics, and more. Our planet\u2019s weather challenges are only going to intensify as the climate continues to change, and improved forecasts are key to helping us prepare.</p><p>Looking back at Hurricane Milton, it still feels surreal that our balloons managed to ride into a storm of that scale. Yet that was the moment WindBorne proved that a new and agile system could deliver real value where legacy methods fall short. In a world where an extra 12 or 24 hours of warning can mean the difference between safety and devastation, end-to-end AI forecasting offers a revolution in how people can observe, predict, and protect themselves from the most powerful forces on Earth. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Real-world <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking\" target=\"_blank\">mesh networks</a> have proved vulnerable to shutdowns in some of <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/albrecht\" target=\"_blank\">the very settings</a>, such as certain kinds of large crowds, they\u2019re supposed to be good at handling.</p><p>So researchers from City College of New York, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins University have recently built a prototype mesh networking system that\u2019s been hardened for some of the most challenging and adversarial environments around: political protests.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1872\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> presented last week at the ACM <a href=\"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Conference on Computer and Communications Security</a> in Taipei, Taiwan, the researchers announced a prototype mesh network called Amigo. <span>Amigo, for starters, has been designed to work in environments where the Internet has been shut off, as seen during unrest in <a href=\"https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/shutdowns/\" target=\"_blank\">India, Iraq, and Syria</a>, among other countries.</span></p><p>\u201cShutting down the Internet during times of great civil protest is a way to prevent people from being able to organize and come together,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/tushar-jois\" target=\"_blank\">Tushar Jois</a>, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at City College. \u201cThat is what we\u2019re specifically tailoring our technology for.\u201d</p><p>Amigo proposes at least three ways to bolster the more traditional approaches to mesh networks. <a href=\"https://martinralbrecht.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bridgefy-abridged.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recent scholarship</a> on mesh outages in protest scenarios reveals problems such as network messages failing to deliver, appearing out of order, and exposing users to being traced\u2014even if the nodes in the network (for example, phones running the mesh app) are right next to each other. The researchers found that prying beneath the mesh network\u2019s high-level, encrypted communications and down into nuts-and-bolts <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lifi-standards\" target=\"_self\">Wi-Fi</a> operations revealed opportunities that previous mesh networks had failed to seize on.</p><p>\u201cThe story is the cryptography alone won\u2019t save us,\u201d says Jois. He and colleagues presented a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5lInx9-vP8\" target=\"_blank\">version of their Amigo paper</a> earlier this year at the <a href=\"https://rwc.iacr.org/2025/program.php\" target=\"_blank\">Real World Cryptography conference</a> in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p><h3>Why Political Protests Matter in Mesh Networks</h3><p><span>Amigo</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/about-us/news/using-messaging-service-bridgefy-could-have-dire-consequences-for-users-if-privacy-protection-issues-aren-t-fixed/\" target=\"_blank\">drew key lessons from</a><span> a set of </span><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/albrecht\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a><span> on mesh networking in a range of recent political protests\u2014including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong prodemocracy actions in 2019 and \u201920</a>. </span><span></span></p><p>For example, how previous mesh networks handled routing of their messages could accidentally lead to a flooding of the zone. Multiple nodes in a stressed network can pump out redundant messages into the network, causing communications to grind to a crawl. By contrast, Amigo forms what the researchers call dynamic \u201ccliques\u201d\u2014where only designated leader nodes exchange messages with each other, while regular nodes just talk to their leader. This technique, the researchers say, substantially reduces message traffic, decreasing the chance the network might seize up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re [among] the people to discover that in secure mesh messaging, we\u2019ve had this blind spot,\u201d Jois says. \u201cSo we proposed some new algorithms that help address this blind spot. Dynamic-clique routing basically allows groups of nodes to self-organize routing units in a geographic area based on GPS.\u201d</p><p>Another example is Amigo\u2019s approach to cryptography and anonymity. Previous mesh environments provided no easy way to remove members from encrypted groups. (In a protest setting, group removal might be necessary, for instance, because a device or its user has been apprehended by authorities.) Older mesh standards also leaked metadata that could reveal other group members. <span>Amigo aims to correct both problems.</span></p><p>\u201cOne thing we talk about is outsider anonymity,\u201d Jois says. \u201cPeople who are outside your group don\u2019t know that the group exists.\u201d Amigo, he says, adds new algorithms to ensure outsider anonymity and group removal. Jois adds that Amigo aims to achieve these goals while still retaining protections of existing encrypted-message networks like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/encrypted-messaging-app\" target=\"_self\">WhatsApp and Signal</a>.</p><p>Traditionally, Jois adds, encrypted messaging provides a couple of important features. One feature involves protecting past messages: via \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy\" target=\"_blank\">forward secrecy</a>,\u201d even if keys are stolen today, past messages are still secure. The other involves protecting future messages: via \u201c<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536374\" target=\"_blank\">post-compromise security</a>,\u201d even a compromised system can heal by generating new keys and thus locking an intruder out of future communications. Amigo retains both features.  </p><p>\u201cWe add [our new protections] to the classic forward secrecy and post-compromise security,\u201d Jois says. \u201cBut maybe there are more properties that we need from a security perspective. So I think juggling all of those will be fun.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dbarrada/\" target=\"_blank\">Diogo Baradas</a>, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Canada, adds that Amigo could find applications beyond political protests.</p><p>\u201cAnother scenario where such crowd dynamics are of particular interest include natural-disaster scenarios\u2014like flooding, fires, and earthquakes\u2014where Internet communications may become unavailable,\u201d says Baradas, who is not on the Amigo team. \u201cAnd affected citizens, first responders, and volunteers must coordinate to ensure a fitting response.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An illustration of simulated versus organic movement.

She\u2019s been investigating the \u201crandom walk\u201d\u2013style approach to modeling crowds in most mesh network environments.</p><p>Like nitrogen and oxygen molecules in a sample of air, individual mesh nodes today are typically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_waypoint_model\" target=\"_blank\">imagined to each trace random paths</a> whose motions are uncorrelated to nearby nodes. <span>If this, Ruiz says, is how mesh networks mathematically model crowd behavior, then </span><span>no wonder</span><span> </span><span>mesh networks seize up in certain real-world environments. </span></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no understanding of the way that protesters are physically moving in these mass civil protests,\u201d Ruiz says of traditional mesh models of crowd behavior. \u201cAnd without having that understanding of the way that people move and what drives the movement, what it looks like on any level, it\u2019s going to be nearly impossible to develop a really tailored solution.\u201d</p><p>So instead, Ruiz is exploring ways to bring models of what she calls psychological crowds into mesh-network algorithms. She <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEatax_cbKA&amp;list=PLlg8We3ePxcPG0FRTcEEdsViRevFjikIU&amp;index=8&amp;t=35951s\" target=\"_blank\">described this work</a> in August at the <a href=\"https://schedule.hope.net/hope16/schedule/#2025-08-16\" target=\"_blank\">Hackers on Planet Earth conference</a> in Queens, N.Y. </p><p>\u201cPsychological crowds are a concentration of people in a place that have a certain shared sense of self,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that shared sense of self can directly impact the way that people move. They tend to move closer together. They don\u2019t tolerate as much distance being put in between one another. They move slower.\u201d</p><p>Jois says developing more realistic mathematical models of psychological crowds is a cross-disciplinary effort. It\u2019s part math, and it\u2019s part sociology and group psychology. <span>\u201c[Ruiz\u2019s] current work is about determining communications dynamics and [group] dynamics by going to protest activists and journalists\u2014in these places where Internet shutdowns are common\u2014and figuring out what are their needs,\u201d he says.</span></p><p><span>\u201cSince mesh is so heavily impacted by physical movement and traffic patterns,\u201d Ruiz adds, \u201cHaving a strong understanding is key to furthering Amigo and other future mesh messaging tools.\u201d </span></p><p>Jois adds that Amigo drew as inspiration for its crowd models a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UROUN37_gUqrDd4FYDFYXQAmYuXtsBAfaDLo47Im-Kk/edit#heading=h.9n9f9eiq3xhs\" target=\"_blank\">document</a> created in 2019 by Hong Kong prodemocracy protesters, advising fellow activists how to march and gather. From that and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-585-29603-6_5\" target=\"_blank\">other studies</a> that could <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/highway-blockade-reveals-splits-in-hong-kong-protest-movement-idUSKBN1XP06R/\" target=\"_blank\">help devise mathematical models</a> of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030707/\" target=\"_blank\">real-world crowd movements</a>, Jois says Amigo represents an important next step toward bringing mesh networks into the real world.</p><p>\u201cOur results show that there is some foundational work necessary in mesh networking,\u201d Jois says. \u201cWe can stand in our academic spaces and say, \u2018Oh well, this is what we think is necessary.\u2019 But unless we get that from the source, we don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>"

Every leap\u2014whether it\u2019s smarter phones, more capable cars, or breakthroughs in healthcare and science\u2014relies on chips that are more complex, faster, and packed with more features than ever before. But creating these chips is not just a question of sheer engineering talent or ambition. The design process itself has reached staggering levels of complexity, and with it, the challenge to keep productivity and quality moving forward.</p><p>As we push against the boundaries of physics, chipmakers face more than just technical hurdles. The workforce challenges, tight timelines, and the requirements for building reliable chips are stricter than ever. Enormous effort goes into making sure chip layouts follow detailed constraints\u2014such as maintaining minimum feature sizes for transistors and wires, keeping proper spacing between different layers like metal, polysilicon, and active areas, and ensuring vias overlap correctly to create solid electrical connections. These design rules multiply with every new technology generation. For every innovation, there\u2019s pressure to deliver more with less. So, the question becomes: How do we help designers meet these demands, and how can technology help us handle the complexity without compromising on quality?</p><h2>Shifting the paradigm: the rise of AI in electronic design automation</h2><p>A major wave of change is moving through the entire field of electronic design automation (EDA), the specialized area of software and tools that chipmakers use to design, analyze, and verify the complex integrated circuits inside today\u2019s chips. Artificial intelligence is already touching many parts of the chip design flow\u2014helping with placement and routing, predicting yield outcomes, tuning analog circuits, automating simulation, and even guiding early architecture planning. Rather than simply speeding up old steps, AI is opening doors to new ways of thinking and working.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>Instead of brute-force computation or countless lines of custom code, AI uses advanced algorithms to spot patterns, organize massive datasets, and highlight issues that might otherwise take weeks of manual work to uncover. For example, generative AI can help designers ask questions and get answers in natural language, streamlining routine tasks. Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>This growing partnership between human expertise and machine intelligence is paving the way for what some call a \u201cshift left\u201d or concurrent build revolution\u2014finding and fixing problems much earlier in the design process, before they grow into expensive setbacks. For chipmakers, this means higher quality and faster time to market. For designers, it means a chance to focus on innovation rather than chasing bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Flow diagram: IC design rule checking (DRC), SoC integration, physical verification showing errors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c40c3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/flow-diagram-ic-design-rule-checking-drc-soc-integration-physical-verification-showing-errors.jpg?id=61784279&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 1.

Physical verification checks whether a chip layout meets the manufacturer\u2019s strict rules and faithfully matches the original functional schematic. Its main goal is to ensure the design can be reliably manufactured into a working chip, free of physical defects that might cause failures later on.</span></p><p>Design rule checking (DRC) is the backbone of physical verification. DRC software scans every corner of a chip\u2019s layout for violations\u2014features that might cause defects, reduce yield, or simply make the design un-manufacturable. But today\u2019s chips aren\u2019t just bigger; they\u2019re more intricate, woven from many layers of logic, memory, and analog components, sometimes stacked in three dimensions. The rules aren\u2019t simple either. They may depend on the geometry, the context, the manufacturing process and even the interactions between distant layout features.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man with wavy black hair in a black blazer and white shirt against a plain background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12f34\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-with-wavy-black-hair-in-a-black-blazer-and-white-shirt-against-a-plain-background.jpg?id=61784318&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Priyank Jain leads product management for Calibre Interfaces at Siemens EDA.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p>Traditionally, DRC is performed late in the flow, when all components are assembled into the final chip layout. At this stage, it\u2019s common to uncover millions of violations\u2014and fixing these late-stage issues requires extensive effort, leading to costly delays.</p><p>To minimize this burden, there\u2019s a growing focus on shifting DRC earlier in the flow\u2014a strategy called \u201cshift-left.\u201d Instead of waiting until the entire design is complete, engineers try to identify and address DRC errors much sooner at block and cell levels. This concurrent design and verification approach allows the bulk of errors to be caught when fixes are faster and less disruptive.</p><p>However, running DRC earlier in the flow on a full chip when the blocks are not DRC clean produces results datasets of breathtaking scale\u2014often tens of millions to billions of \u201cerrors,\u201d warnings, or flags because the unfinished chip design is \u201cdirty\u201d compared to a chip that\u2019s been through the full design process. Navigating these \u201cdirty\u201d results is a challenge all on its own. Designers must prioritize which issues to tackle, identify patterns that point to systematic problems, and decide what truly matters. In many cases, this work is slow and \u201cmanual,\u201d depending on the ability of engineers to sort through data, filter what matters, and share findings across teams.</p><p>To cope, design teams have crafted ways to limit the flood of information. They might cap the number of errors per rule, or use informal shortcuts\u2014passing databases or screenshots by email to team members, sharing filters in chat messages, and relying on experts to know where to look. Yet this approach is not sustainable. It risks missing major, chip-wide issues that can cascade through the final product. It slows down response and makes collaboration labor-intensive.</p><p>With ongoing workforce challenges and the surging complexity of modern chips, the need for smarter, more automated DRC analysis becomes urgent. So what could a better solution look like\u2014and how can AI help bridge the gap?</p><h2>The rise of AI-powered DRC analysis</h2><p>Recent breakthroughs in AI have changed the game for DRC analysis in ways that were unthinkable even a few years ago. Rather than scanning line by line or check by check, AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster. These tools use techniques from computer vision, advanced machine learning, and big data analytics to turn what once seemed like an impossible pile of information into a roadmap for action.</p><p>AI\u2019s ability to organize chaotic datasets\u2014finding systematic problems hidden across multiple rules or regions\u2014helps catch risks that basic filtering might miss. By grouping related errors and highlighting hot spots, designers can see the big picture and focus their time where it counts. AI-based clustering algorithms reliably transform weeks of manual investigation into minutes of guided analysis.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster.</p><p>Another benefit: collaboration. By treating results as shared, living datasets\u2014rather than static tables\u2014modern tools let teams assign owners, annotate findings and pass exact analysis views between block and partition engineers, even across organizational boundaries. Dynamic bookmarks and shared UI states cut down on confusion and rework. Instead of \u201cback and forth,\u201d teams move forward together.</p><p>Many of these innovations tease at what\u2019s possible when AI is built into the heart of the verification flow. Not only do they help designers analyze the results; they help everyone reason about the data, summarize findings and make better design decisions all the way to tape out.</p><h2>A real-world breakthrough in DRC analysis and collaboration: Siemens\u2019 Calibre Vision AI</h2><p>One of the most striking examples of AI-powered DRC analysis comes from <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a>, whose <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI platform</a> is setting new standards for how full-chip verification happens. Building on years of experience in physical verification, Siemens realized that breaking bottlenecks required not only smarter algorithms but rethinking how teams work together and how data moves across the flow.</p><p>Vision AI is designed for speed and scalability. It uses a compact error database and a multi-threaded engine to load millions\u2014or even billions\u2014of errors in minutes, visualizing them so engineers see clusters and hot spots across the entire die. Instead of a wall of error codes or isolated rule violations, the tool presents a heat map of the layout, highlighting areas with the highest concentration of issues. By enabling or disabling layers (layout, markers, heat map) and adjusting layer opacity, users get a clear, customizable view of what\u2019s happening\u2014and where to look next.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. </p><p>But the real magic is in AI-guided clustering. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. This means designers can attack the root cause once, fixing problems for hundreds of checks at a time instead of tediously resolving them one by one. In cases where legacy tools would force teams to slog through, for example, 3,400 checks with 600 million errors, Vision AI\u2019s clustering can reduce that effort to investigating just 381 groups\u2014turning mountains into molehills and speeding debug time by at least 2x.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Calibre Vision software, check groups, cells list, and die-view heatmap interface screenshot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ac191\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/calibre-vision-software-check-groups-cells-list-and-die-view-heatmap-interface-screenshot.jpg?id=61784282&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 2. The Calibre Vision AI software automates and simplifies the chip-level DRC verification process.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p><span>Vision AI is also highly collaborative. Dynamic bookmarks capture the exact state of analysis, from layer filters to zoomed layout areas, along with annotations and owner assignments. Sharing a bookmark sends a living analysis\u2014not just a static snapshot\u2014to coworkers, so everyone is working from the same view. Teams can export results databases, distribute actionable groups to block owners, and seamlessly import findings into other Siemens EDA tools for further debug.</span></p><h2>Empowering every designer: reducing the expertise gap</h2><p>A frequent pain point in chip verification is the need for deep expertise\u2014knowing which errors matter, which patterns mean trouble, and how to interpret complex results. Calibre Vision AI helps level the playing field. Its AI-based algorithms consistently create the same clusters and debug paths that senior experts would identify, but does so in minutes. New users can quickly find systematic issues and perform like seasoned engineers, helping chip companies address workforce shortages and staff turnover.</p><p>Beyond clusters and bookmarks, Vision AI lets designers build custom signals by leveraging their own data. The platform secures customer models and data for exclusive use, making sure sensitive information stays within the company. And by integrating with Siemens\u2019 EDA AI ecosystem, <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> supports generative AI chatbots and reasoning assistants. Designers can ask direct questions\u2014about syntax, about a signal, about the flow\u2014and get prompt\u2014accurate answers, streamlining training and adoption.</p><h2>Real results: speeding analysis and sharing insight</h2><p>Customer feedback from leading IC companies shows the real-world value of AI for full-chip DRC analysis and debug. One company reported that Vision AI reduced their debug effort by at least half\u2014a gain that makes the difference between tapeout and delay. Another noted the platform\u2019s signals algorithm automatically creates the same check groups that experienced users would manually identify, saving not just time but energy.</p><p>Quantitative gains are dramatic. For example, Calibre Vision AI can load and visualize error files significantly faster than traditional debug flows. Figure 3 shows the difference in four different test cases: a results file that took 350 minutes with the traditional flow, took Calibre Vision AI only 31 minutes. In another test case (not shown), it took just five minutes to analyze and cluster 3.2 billion errors from more than 380 rule checks into 17 meaningful groups. Instead of getting lost in gigabytes of error data, designers now spend time solving real problems.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar graph comparing traditional flow vs. Vision AI flow times at various nanometer scales.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2f678\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/bar-graph-comparing-traditional-flow-vs-vision-ai-flow-times-at-various-nanometer-scales.jpg?id=61784294&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 3. Charting the results load time between the traditional DRC debug flow and the Calibre Vision AI flow.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><h2>Looking ahead: the future of AI in chip design</h2><p><span></span><span>Today\u2019s chips demand more than incremental improvements in EDA software. As the need for speed, quality and collaboration continues to grow, the story of physical verification will be shaped by smarter, more adaptive technologies. With AI-powered DRC analysis, we see a clear path: a faster and more productive way to find systematic issues, intelligent debug, stronger collaboration and the chance for every designer to make an expert impact.</span></p><p>By combining the creativity of engineers with the speed and insight of AI, platforms like <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> are driving a new productivity curve in full-chip analysis. With these tools, teams don\u2019t just keep up with complexity\u2014they turn it into a competitive advantage.</p><p>At Siemens, the future of chip verification is already taking shape\u2014where intelligence works hand in hand with intuition, and new ideas find their way to silicon faster than ever before. As the industry continues to push boundaries and unlock the next generation of devices, AI will help chip design reach new heights.</p><p><em>For more on Calibre Vision AI and how Siemens is shaping the future of chip design, visit <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">eda.sw.siemens.com</a> and search for Calibre Vision AI.</em></p>"

Then comes mobility, along with broadly connecting all </span><span>manner</span> of machines\u2014not just mobile and fixed computing devices. Having already progressed through the first three Phases of the Internet (and having now entered the fourth), the world today has seen the steady expansion of human potential, while unlocking new industries, and reshaping how everyone connected to the Internet lives and works.  </p><p><span>With a nod to </span><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56966/speech-all-the-worlds-a-stage\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>Shakespeare\u2019s </span></span><em><span><em><span>As You Like It</span></em></span></em></a><span><span>, what follows is our sketch of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases. However, unlike the Bard\u2019s \u201c7 ages of man,\u201d each of the Internet\u2019s eras do not come to an end when the next one starts. The Internet\u2019s 7 Phases, in other words, are not sequential but rather additive. Each phase builds on and extends the </span><span>previous</span><span>, in the process setting the foundation for what is still to come.</span></span> </p><h2>Phase 1: The Internet </h2><p><span>The original Internet was conceived in the 1970s to interconnect computer networks. Its groundbreaking aspect lay not only in its architecture but also in the principle of openness. By adopting </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/todays-internet-still-relies-on-an-arpanetera-protocol-the-request-for-comments\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>common protocols</span></span></a><span>, diverse networks could connect regardless of their location. The Internet has transformed isolated systems into a \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d enabling unprecedented collaboration across institutions and borders. </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/write-and-wrong\">Early applications</a> such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/computer-networking\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>email and file transfer</span></span></a> <span>demonstrated</span> that connectivity could democratize access to information. </p><p><span>In the early 1990s, the </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fathers-of-the-internet-revolution-urge-todays-pioneers-to-reinvent-the-web\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>World Wide Web</span></span></a> introduced a unifying framework: URLs as addresses, HTTP for communication, HTML as a common language, and the browser as a universal interface. Between <a href=\"https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>1991 and \u201893</span></span></a><span>, the Web transformed the Internet from a research network into a global platform for information exchange, paving the way for broader adoption. </span> </p><h2>Phase 2: The Mobile Internet </h2><p><span>The next big leap involved mobility.</span> <a href=\"https://icons8.com/blog/articles/what-was-the-internet-of-the-early-2000s/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>In the early to mid-2000s</span></span></a><span>, as mobile Internet devices spread and smartphones matured, connectivity turned portable. The Internet was no longer tethered to desktops; it traveled in pockets, purses, and messenger bags. </span> </p><p><span><span>The Internet\u2019s newfound portability connected billions of people around the world for the first time, reshaping communication, commerce, and entertainment. Social networks </span><span>flourished,</span> mobile payments reached those without access to traditional banking, and services like </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>ridesharing</span></span></a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-algorithms-that-make-instacart-roll\" target=\"_blank\">food delivery</a> became everyday conveniences. Connectivity had transformed from being deskbound and centered around one\u2019s PC to becoming an always-on, portable, digital resource network woven into daily life. The <a href=\"https://actonline.org/2021/04/07/a-brief-history-of-time-the-app-stores/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>app economy</span></span></a> soon followed, where any service or application could be accessed instantly at our fingertips. </p><h2>Phase 3: The Internet of Things (IoT) </h2><p><span>Connectivity expanded beyond PCs and mobile devices to all digital devices with any networking capability, creating today\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>Internet of Things</span></span></a><span> (IoT). Sensors, appliances, and other devices in homes, factories, cars, and cities </span><span>stream</span> telemetry data around the clock, turning the Internet into an invisible nervous system linking the physical and digital worlds. The IoT has opened new possibilities in healthcare, manufacturing, <span>logistics</span><span>, and agriculture such as connected tractors and soil sensors that enable smart farming, boosting yields while conserving resources.</span> </p><h2>Phase 4: The Internet of AI Agents  </h2><p><span>The most profound shift now underway is the rise of </span><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-economy\" target=\"_blank\">AI agents</a>.</span><span> Unlike IoT devices that merely </span><span>transmit</span> data, agents can <span>perceive, reason, act, and collaborate<strong>.</strong></span><span> They are no longer passive </span><span>endpoints</span> but rather independent actors shaping digital and physical economies. </p><p><span>Two dimensions define this phase:</span> </p><ul><li><span><strong>Digital AI agents:</strong></span><span> This category includes software-based entities such as coding copilots, digital assistants, workflow </span><span>orchestrators,</span> and trading algorithms. They live in the digital world but shape economies and <span>services</span>. Consider, for instance, a coding copilot that <span>assists</span> developers and collaborates with other agents to debug, refactor, and <span>optimize</span> software in real time. </li></ul><ul><li><span><strong>Physical AI agents:</strong></span><span> By contrast, physical AI agents are systems that </span><span>operate</span> across both digital and physical environments such as autonomous vehicles, drones, industrial robots, and medical devices. A self-driving car that fuses <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar-on-a-chip\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>lidar</span></span></a><span>, radar, and </span><span>ISAC (<a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2024/6/integrated-sensing-and-communication\" target=\"_blank\">Integrated Sensing and Communications</a>)</span><span> is one increasingly prominent type of physical AI agent today. This agent detects its environment, avoids collisions, and coordinates with nearby vehicles and traffic systems. ISAC functions here as part of the vehicle, supplying the instant-by-instant environmental awareness that allows the car to navigate without human control.</span></li></ul><p><span>We call Phase 4 not just the era of AI agents but rather the \u201cInternet of AI Agents.\u201d This is because value arises not from isolated intelligence but from </span><span>networked intelligence.</span> Agents will communicate, collaborate, and coordinate in real time across networks on Earth and in the oceans and skies and beyond, creating new forms of productivity, trust, and resilience. </p><h2>Phase 5: The Internet of Senses </h2><p><span>If Phase 4 brought intelligence through agents, the next step of Internet integration is </span><span><span>perception</span>.</span> The Internet of Senses extends connectivity from exchanging information to exchanging <span>experiences<strong>.</strong></span> </p><p><span>Two dimensions define this phase:</span> </p><ul><li><span><strong>Multisensory communication</strong></span> expands the network\u2019s palate beyond just text, audio, and video. In the age of the Internet of Senses, networks will carry signals that convey the modalities of touch, taste, and smell. Advances in haptic wearables, digital olfaction, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) will allow a shopper to \u201cfeel\u201d the texture of clothing online or \u201csmell\u201d perfume before buying. In healthcare, doctors will remotely examine patients using haptic gloves that transmit the sense of feeling. Meanwhile, education will become more immersive, enabling students to explore history or science through tactile and sensory experiences. </li></ul><ul><li><span><strong>ISAC at the network level:</strong></span> Unlike the era of AI agents, where intelligence came embedded with its own sensing and communications systems, here the <span>network is the thing doing the perceiving<strong>.</strong></span> Programmable surfaces and meta-materials will shape signals, enabling motion detection, distance measurement, and localization as part of system communications. Smart cities, for instance, will detect traffic flow and crowd movement in real time, feeding its own \u201csenses\u201d of the environment directly into its network. </li></ul><p><span>The Internet of Senses will make connectivity </span><span>immersive and context-aware,</span> enriching how humans and machines interact and laying the foundation for embodied intelligence in the physical world. </p><h2>Phase 6: The Ubiquitous Internet </h2><p><span>As billions of devices and AI agents come online, the importance of seamless coverage ramps up. Phase 6, the Ubiquitous Internet, addresses this network-level need by integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial infrastructures like cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, local area networks, fiber, satellites, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-wireless\" target=\"_blank\">high-altitude platforms</a> into one unified global network.</span> </p><p><span><span>Ultimately, a</span> Ubiquitous Internet will ensure connectivity everywhere across remote villages, open oceans, skies, orbit, cislunar space, and beyond. This wide-scale network will underpin the next advances in autonomy, </span><span>perception</span><span>, and intelligence, enabling AI agents and human users alike to </span><span>operate</span> without borders. </p><h2>Phase 7: The Quantum Internet  </h2><p><span>The final frontier in connectivity will be the Quantum Internet, where quantum communication, networking, sensing, and computing converge. Unlike the classical Internet, which transmits bits, the Quantum Internet distributes </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-quantum-entanglement\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>qubits</span></span></a><span> through entanglement and teleportation, enabling capabilities beyond anything conventional systems can achieve. Early demonstrations are already showing </span><span>the Quantum</span> Internet\u2019s potential. Entangled qubits transmitted over optical fibers and satellites will one day create ultra-secure communication channels, resistant to interception, while quantum sensors achieve <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vacuum-measurement\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented precision</a> in measuring time, motion, and the environment. These innovations will together open possibilities such as navigation without GPS and ultra-sensitive environmental monitoring.  </p><p><span><span>Greater still </span><span>is</span> the promise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-networks-cisco-quantum-computing\" target=\"_blank\">quantum networking</a>, which will interconnect distributed quantum processors into one planetary-scale connected computer system. AI systems will run across multiple quantum computers at once, working together on the same sets of problems. Expect integrated quantum AI systems, for example, to speed up the creation of new medicines and to optimize routes for complicated supply and delivery chains.</span></p><p><span>The Quantum Internet will not replace the classical Internet but augment it, overlaying quantum signals with classical bits. Just as the Internet of Agents put intelligence in motion, the Quantum Internet will supercharge that intelligence by embedding it with the laws of physics at the smallest scales: weaving together sensing, security, computation, and AI into a single global system of connectivity.</span></p><h2>Comparing the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases  </h2><p><span><span>Taken together, the 7 Phases of the Internet above tell how connectivity has expanded </span><span>from workstations and mainframes</span> to mobile devices to people and the physical world. We have drawn lessons from the first three phases to forecast several new phases ahead: involving networked integration of AI agents, senses, everything in the classical world, and finally down into the quantum realm as well. To highlight how each phase is built on the last, what follows is a side-by-side view of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases:</span></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-cards\"><noscript><img alt=\"cards visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25618132/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p><span>As the above illustrates, the Internet\u2019s evolution has been both </span><span>vertical and horizontal.</span><span> Vertically, each phase has added new layers of capability from hosts to people to devices to agents, building on the shared foundation of connectivity. Horizontally, new paradigms have often run </span><span>in parallel</span><span> with existing ones: fixed and mobile networks </span><span>coexisted,</span><span> IoT expanded alongside human communication. And in the future, quantum channels will share the same fiber as classical signals on different wavelengths.</span></p><p><span>The combination of layering and parallel expansion has made the Internet resilient, scalable, and continuously transformative. Meanwhile, at every stage, connectivity has adapted to new demands\u2014enabling the Internet to be not just a network of endpoints but a<strong> </strong></span><span>fabric of fabrics,</span> supporting diversity while fostering integration. </p><p><span><span>Each phase of the Internet\u2014from networks to people to things to agents to senses to ubiquity to the quantum world\u2014has extended and will continue to extend the foundation of connectivity. Each of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases overcomes the limits of the </span><span>previous</span> phase, while also opening new frontiers. </span> </p><p><span><span>Even as the Internet </span><span>enters into</span> Phase 4, long gone is its limited mandate of merely moving data packets. The Internet is today and over its future phases becoming the intelligent, resilient, and universal fabric upon which the world\u2019s digital future rests. And in the age of AI, connectivity is not merely the foundation. It is increasingly </span><span>intelligence itself.</span></p>"

We can\u2019t control who our manager is, but we can shape that relationship to better work for us.</span></p><p>Managing up is an important skill, and something I didn\u2019t even realize I could do until I was a Senior Engineer at Facebook. I could have unlocked considerably more career support and investment if I had worked better with my manager.</p><p>Here are three core ideas that made a meaningful impact on how I approach my manager relationship: </p><p>First, understand your manager\u2019s motivations. Many early-career engineers are completely clueless about how their managers are evaluated. Ultimately, your manager is assessed on the overall impact of their team. Your manager will often spend time giving feedback to reports and ensuring engineers are unblocked. But they may also need to remove people from the team or cancel projects. You need to determine what your manager cares about and how your work fits into their priorities.</p><p>Second, understand your boss\u2019s preferred communication style. Many software projects come with a README file that describes how to use them. Imagine you had to write a README file for your manager: the need-to-know information to best interact with them. This document would include their preferences and pet peeves around communication, their preferred work environments, and their strengths and weaknesses. Once you have a README file, either something you wrote on behalf of your manager or something you collaboratively put together with your manager\u2019s input, apply it to your interactions.</p><p>Finally, figure out how to work productively with your manager as you plan your tasks. Instead of asking how you can get involved in something new, bring value. Provide data, insights, or proposals that move the conversation forward, rather than simply waiting for an assignment. Also, no manager wants to deal with surprises. Ensure that you communicate ahead of any surprises, and you\u2019ve thought about next steps when things inevitably go wrong. </p><p>You can control, at least partially, your manager\u2019s investment in you. This is not about after-work drinks or political maneuvering \u2014 managing up is a critical skill for career advancement, whether we do it consciously or not. </p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">Talent Shortage Threatens Energy Sector\u2019s Future</a></h2><p>We need more power engineers.

But beneath that smooth experience, the system is quietly generating a dense digital trail of personal data.</span></p><p>That\u2019s the hidden cost of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">agentic AI</a> (systems that don\u2019t just answer questions, but perceive, plan, and act on your behalf). Every plan, prompt, and action gets logged; caches and forecasts accumulate; traces of daily routines settle into long-lived storage.</p><p>These records aren\u2019t sloppy mistakes\u2014they\u2019re the default behavior of most agentic AI systems. The good news is that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Simple engineering habits can maintain autonomy and efficiency while dramatically shrinking the data footprint.<strong></strong></p><h2>How AI Agents Collect and Store Personal Data<strong></strong></h2><p>During its first week, our hypothetical home optimizer impresses. Like many agentic systems, it uses a planner based on a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models\" target=\"_blank\">large language model</a> (LLM) to coordinate familiar devices throughout the house. It monitors electricity prices and weather data, adjusts thermostats, toggles smart plugs, tilts blinds to reduce glare and heat, and schedules EV charging. The home becomes easier to manage and more economical.</p><p>To reduce sensitive data, the system stores only pseudonymous resident profiles locally and doesn\u2019t access cameras or microphones. It updates its plan when prices or weather shift, and logs short, structured reflections to improve the next week\u2019s run.</p><p>But the home\u2019s residents have no idea how much personal data is being collected behind the scenes. Agentic AI systems generate data as a natural consequence of how they operate. And in most baseline agent configurations, that data accumulates. While not considered best practice in the industry, such a configuration is a pragmatic starting point for getting an AI agent up and running quickly.</p><p>A careful review reveals the extent of the digital trail.</p><p>By default, the optimizer keeps detailed logs of both instructions given to the AI and its actions\u2014what it did, and where and when. It relies on broad, long-term access permissions to devices and data sources, and stores information from its interactions with these external tools. Electricity prices and weather forecasts are cached, temporary in-memory computations pile up over the course of a week, and short reflections meant to fine-tune the next run can build up into long-lived behavioral profiles. Incomplete deletion processes often leave fragments behind.</p><p>On top of that, many smart devices collect their own usage data for analytics, creating copies outside of the AI system itself. The result is a sprawling digital trail, spread across local logs, cloud services, mobile apps, and monitoring tools\u2014far more than most households realize.</p><h2>Six Ways to Reduce AI Agents\u2019 Data Trails<br /></h2><p>We don\u2019t need a new design doctrine\u2014just disciplined habits that reflect how agentic systems operate in the real world.</p><p>The first practice is constraining memory to the task at hand. For the home optimizer, this means limiting working memory to a single week\u2019s run. Reflections are structured, minimal, and short-lived, so they can improve the next run without accumulating into a dossier of household routines. The AI works only within its time and task limits, and the select pieces of data that persist have clear expiration markers.</p><p>Second, deletion should be easy and thorough. Every plan, trace, cache, embedding, and log is tagged with the same run ID so that a single \u201cdelete this run\u201d command propagates through all local and cloud storage and then provides confirmation. A separate, minimal audit trail (necessary for accountability) retains only essential event metadata under its own expiration clock.</p><p>Third, access to devices should be carefully limited through temporary, task-specific permissions. A home optimizer could receive short-lived \u201ckeys\u201d for only the needed actions\u2014adjusting a thermostat, turning a plug on or off, or scheduling an EV charger. These keys expire quickly, preventing overreach and reducing the data that must be stored.</p><p>Next, the agent\u2019s actions must be visible through a readable \u201c<a href=\"https://sierra.ai/blog/agent-traces\" target=\"_blank\">agent trace</a>.\u201d This interface shows what was planned, what ran, where data flowed, and when each piece of data will be erased. Users should be able to export the trace or delete all data from a run easily, and the information should be presented in plain language.</p><p>The fifth good habit is enforcing a policy of always using the least intrusive method of data collection. So if our household optimizer, dedicated to energy efficiency and comfort, can infer occupancy from passive motion-detection or door sensors, the system must not escalate to video (for example, grabbing a security-camera snapshot). Such escalation is prohibited unless it\u2019s strictly necessary and no equally effective, less intrusive alternative exists.</p><p>Finally, mindful observability limits how the system monitors itself. The agent logs only essential identifiers, avoids storing raw sensor data, caps how much and how often information is recorded, and disables third-party analytics by default. And every piece of stored data has a clear expiration time.</p><p>Together, these practices reflect well-established <a href=\"https://www.onetrust.com/blog/gdpr-principles/\" target=\"_blank\">privacy principles</a>: purpose limitation, data minimization, access and storage limitation, and accountability.</p><h2>What a Privacy-First AI Agent Looks Like</h2><p>It\u2019s possible to preserve autonomy and functionality while dramatically shrinking the data trail.</p><p>With these six habits, the home optimizer continues to precool, shade, and charge on schedule. But the system interacts with fewer devices and data services, copies of logs and cached data are easier to track, all stored data has a clear expiration date, and the deletion process provides a user-visible confirmation. A single trace page summarizes intent, actions, destinations, and retention time for each data item.</p><p>These principles extend beyond home automation. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use\" target=\"_blank\">Fully online AI agents</a>, such as travel planners that read calendars and manage bookings, operate on the same plan-act-reflect loop, and the same habits can be applied.</p><p>Agentic systems don\u2019t need a new theory of privacy. What matters is aligning engineering practices with how these AI systems actually operate. Ultimately, we need to design AI agents that respect privacy and responsibly manage data. By thinking now about agents\u2019 digital trails, we can build systems that serve people without taking ownership of their data.</p>"

As we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trillion-transistor-gpu\" target=\"_self\">crammed more and more transistors onto chips</a>, we\u2019ve lost the room to release that heat efficiently. Instead of the heat spreading out quickly across the silicon, which makes it much easier to remove, it builds up to form hot spots, which can be tens of degrees warmer than the rest of the chip. That extreme heat forces systems to throttle the performance of CPUs and GPUs to avoid degrading the chips.</p><p>In other words, what began as a quest for miniaturization has turned into a battle against thermal energy. This challenge extends across all electronics. In computing, high-performance processors demand ever-increasing power densities. (New Nvidia GPU B300 servers will consume <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-b300/\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 15 kilowatts</a> of power.)

Spreading out the heat would lower the temperature of the most critical devices and circuits and let the other time-tested cooling technologies work more efficiently. To do that, we\u2019d have to introduce a highly thermally conductive material inside the IC, mere nanometers from the transistors, without messing up any of their very precise and sensitive properties. Enter an unexpected material\u2014diamond.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>In some ways, diamond is ideal. It\u2019s one of the most thermally conductive materials on the planet\u2014many times more efficient than copper\u2014yet it\u2019s also electrically insulating. However, integrating it into chips is tricky: Until recently we knew how to grow it only at circuit-slagging temperatures in excess of 1,000 \u00b0C.</p><p>But my research group at Stanford University has managed what seemed impossible. We can now grow a form of diamond suitable for spreading heat, directly atop semiconductor devices at low enough temperatures that even the most delicate interconnects inside advanced chips will survive. To be clear, this isn\u2019t the kind of diamond you see in jewelry, which is a large single crystal. Our diamonds are a polycrystalline coating no more than a couple of micrometers thick.</p><p>The potential benefits could be huge. In some of our earliest gallium-nitride radio-frequency transistors, the addition of diamond dropped the device temperature by more than 50 \u00b0C. At the lower temperature, the transistors amplified X-band radio signals five times as well as before. We think our diamond will be even more important for advanced CMOS chips. Researchers predict that upcoming chipmaking technologies could make hot spots almost 10 \u00b0C hotter [see , \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_self\">Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever</a>\u201d, in this issue]. That\u2019s probably why our research is drawing intense interest from the chip industry, including Applied Materials, Samsung, and TSMC. If our work continues to succeed as it has, heat will become a far less onerous constraint in CMOS and other electronics too.</p><h2>Where Heat Begins and Ends in Chips</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A rectangle of black fading into bright gray at the bottom.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d8b96\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rectangle-of-black-fading-into-bright-gray-at-the-bottom.png?id=61766985&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the boundary between the diamond and the semiconductor, a thin layer of silicon carbide forms. It acts as a bridge for heat to flow into the diamond. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Mohamadali Malakoutian</small></p><p>Heat starts within transistors and the interconnects that link them, as the flow of current meets resistance. That means most of it is generated near the surface of the semiconductor substrate. From there it rises either through layers of metal and insulation or through the semiconductor itself, depending on the package architecture. The heat then encounters a thermal interface material designed to spread it out before it ultimately reaches a heat sink, a radiator, or some sort of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">liquid cooling</a>, where air or fluid carries the heat away.</p><p>The dominant cooling strategies today center around advances in heat sinks, fans, and radiators. In pursuit of even better cooling, researchers have explored liquid cooling using microfluidic channels and removing heat using phase-change materials. Some computer clusters go so far as to submerge the servers in thermally conductive, dielectric\u2014electrically insulating\u2014liquids.</p><p>These innovations are critical steps forward, but they still have limitations. Some are so expensive they\u2019re worthwhile only for the highest-performing chips; others are simply too bulky for the job. (Your smartphone can\u2019t carry a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/xmems\" target=\"_self\">conventional fan</a>.) And none are likely to be very effective as we move toward chip architectures resembling silicon skyscrapers that stack multiple layers of chips. Such <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_self\">3D systems</a> are only as viable as our ability to remove heat from every layer within it.</p><p>The big problem is that chip materials are poor heat conductors, so the heat becomes trapped and concentrated, causing the temperature to skyrocket within the chip. At higher temperatures, transistors leak more current, wasting power; they age more quickly, too.</p><p>Heat spreaders allow the heat to move laterally, diluting it and allowing the circuits to cool. But they\u2019re positioned far\u2014relatively, of course\u2014from where the heat is generated, and so they\u2019re of little help with these hot spots. We need a heat-spreading technology that can exist within nanometers of where the heat is generated. This is where our new low-temperature diamond could be essential.</p><h2>How to Make Diamonds</h2><p>Before my lab turned to developing diamond as a heat-spreading material, we were working on it as a semiconductor. In its single-crystal form\u2014like the kind on your finger\u2014it has a wide bandgap and ability to withstand enormous electric fields. Single-crystalline diamond also offers some of the highest thermal conductivity recorded in any material, reaching 2,200 to 2,400 watts per meter per kelvin\u2014roughly six times as conductive as copper. Polycrystalline diamond\u2014an easier to make material\u2014can approach these values when grown thick. Even in this form, it outperforms copper.</p><p>As attractive as diamond transistors might be, I was keenly aware\u2014based on my experience researching gallium nitride devices\u2014of the long road ahead. The problem is one of scale. Several companies are working to scale high-purity diamond substrates to 50, 75, and even 100 millimeters but the diamond substrates we could acquire commercially were only about 3 mm across.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A polygon with layers demarcated in it surrounded by a jagged blue area. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"38b33\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-polygon-with-layers-demarcated-in-it-surrounded-by-a-jagged-blue-area.png?id=61771341&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors were an ideal test case for diamond cooling. The devices are 3D and the critical heat-generating part, the two-dimensional electron gas, is close to the surface. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chris Philpot</small></p>So we decided instead to try growing diamond films on large silicon wafers, in the hope of moving toward commercial-scale diamond substrates. In general, this is done by reacting methane and hydrogen at high temperatures, 900 \u00b0C or more. This results in not a single crystal but a forest of narrow columns. As they grow taller, the nanocolumns coalesce into a uniform film, but by the time they form high-quality polycrystalline diamond, the film is already very thick. This thick growth adds stress to the material and often leads to cracking and other problems.<p>But what if we used this polycrystalline coating as a heat spreader for other devices? If we could get diamond to grow within nanometers of transistors, get it to spread heat both vertically and laterally, and integrate it seamlessly with the silicon, metal, and dielectric in chips, it might do the job.</p><p>There were good reasons to think it would work. Diamond is electrically insulating, and it has a relatively low dielectric constant. That means it makes a poor capacitor, so signals sent through diamond-encrusted interconnects might not degrade much. Thus diamond could act as a \u201cthermal dielectric,\u201d one that is electrically insulating but thermally conducting.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"SEM images showing surface before and after polycrystalline diamond growth on silicon oxide.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"94099\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/sem-images-showing-surface-before-and-after-polycrystalline-diamond-growth-on-silicon-oxide.png?id=61771368&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Polycrystalline diamond could help reduce temperatures inside 3D chips. Diamond thermal vias would grow inside micrometers-deep holes so heat can flow from vertically from one chip to a diamond heat spreader in another chip that\u2019s stacked atop it.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dennis Rich</small></p><p>For our plan to work, we were going to have to learn to grow diamond differently. We knew there wasn\u2019t room to grow a thick film inside a chip. We also knew the narrow, spiky crystal pillars made in the first part of the growth process don\u2019t transmit heat laterally very well, so we\u2019d need to grow large-grained crystals from the start to get the heat moving horizontally. A third problem was that the existing diamond films didn\u2019t form a coating on the sides of devices, which would be important for inherently 3D devices. But the biggest impediment was the high temperature needed to grow the diamond film, which would damage, if not destroy, an IC\u2019s circuits. We were going to have to cut the growth temperature at least in half.</p><p>Just lowering the temperature doesn\u2019t work. (We tried: You wind up, basically, with soot, which is electrically conductive\u2014the opposite of what\u2019s needed.) We found that adding oxygen to the mix helped, because it continuously etched away carbon deposits that weren\u2019t diamond. And through <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/9/10/498\" target=\"_blank\">extensive experimentation</a>, we were able to find a formula that produced coatings of large-grained polycrystalline diamond all around devices at 400 \u00b0C, which is a survivable temperature for CMOS circuits and other devices.</p><h2>Thermal Boundary Resistance</h2><p>Although we had found a way to grow the right kind of diamond coatings, we faced another critical challenge\u2014the phonon bottleneck, also known as thermal boundary resistance (TBR). Phonons are packets of heat energy, in the way that photons are packets of electromagnetic energy. Specifically, they\u2019re a quantized version of the vibration of a crystal lattice. These phonons can pile up at the boundary between materials, resisting the flow of heat. Reducing TBR has long been a goal in thermal interface engineering, and it is often done by introducing different materials at the boundary. But semiconductors are compatible only with certain materials, limiting our choices.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A cartoon of squares stacked atop one another and connected by a forest of vertical links. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"386f9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-cartoon-of-squares-stacked-atop-one-another-and-connected-by-a-forest-of-vertical-links.png?id=61771378&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Thermal scaffolding would link layers of heat-spreading polycrystalline diamond in one chip to those in another chip in a 3D-stacked silicon. The thermal pillars would traverse each chip\u2019s interconnects and dielectric material to move heat vertically through the stack. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Srabanti Chowdhury</small></p><p>In the end, we got lucky. While growing diamond on GaN capped with silicon nitride, we observed something unexpected: The measured TBR was <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c13833\" target=\"_blank\">much lower than prior reports led us to expect</a>. (The low TBR was independently measured, initially by <a href=\"https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-h-h-kuball\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Kuball</a> at the University of Bristol, in England, and later by <a href=\"https://me.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1618/Samuel-GrahamJr\" target=\"_blank\">Samuel Graham Jr</a>., then at Georgia Tech, who both have been coauthors and collaborators in several of our papers.)</p><p>Through further investigation of the interface science and engineering, and in collaboration with <a href=\"https://mse.utdallas.edu/ourteam/faculty/cho-k/\" target=\"_blank\">K.J. Cho</a> at the University of Texas at Dallas, we identified the cause of the lower TBR. <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413734\" target=\"_blank\">Intermixing at the interface</a> between the diamond and silicon nitride led to the formation of silicon carbide, which acted as a kind of bridge for the phonons, allowing more efficient heat transfer. Though this began as a scientific discovery, its technological impact was immediate\u2014with a silicon carbide interface, our devices exhibited significantly improved thermal performance.</p><h2>GaN HEMTs: The First Test Case</h2><p>We began testing our new low-TBR diamond coatings in gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). These devices amplify RF signals by controlling current through a two-dimensional electron gas that forms within its channel. We leveraged the pioneering research on HEMTs done by <a href=\"https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/umesh-mishra\" target=\"_blank\">Umesh Mishra</a>\u2019s laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I had been a graduate student. The Mishra lab invented a particular form of the material called N-polar gallium nitride. Their N-polar GaN HEMTs demonstrate exceptional power density at high frequencies, particularly in the W-band, the 75- to 110-gigahertz part of the microwave spectrum.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/silicon-carbide\" target=\"_self\">Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide Fight for Green Tech Domination</a></p><p>What made these HEMTs such a good test case is one defining feature of the device: The gate, which controls the flow of current through the device, is within tens of nanometers of the transistor\u2019s channel. That means that heat is generated very close to the surface of the device, and any interference our diamond coating could cause would quickly show in the device\u2019s operation.</p><p>We introduced the diamond layer so that it surrounded the HEMT completely, even on the sides. By maintaining a growth temperature below 400 \u00b0C, we hoped to preserve core device functionality. While we did see some decline in high-frequency performance, the thermal benefits were substantial\u2014<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019509\" target=\"_blank\">channel temperatures dropped by a remarkable 70 \u00b0C</a>. This breakthrough could be a potentially transformative solution for RF systems, allowing them to operate at higher power than ever before.</p><h2>Diamond in CMOS</h2><p>We wondered if our diamond layer could also work in high-power CMOS chips. My colleagues at Stanford, <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~hspwong/\" target=\"_blank\">H.-S. Philip Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/subhasish-mitra\" target=\"_blank\">Subhasish Mitra</a>, have long championed 3D-stacked chip architectures. In CMOS computing chips, 3D stacking appears to be the most viable way forward to increase integration density, improve performance, and overcome the limitations of traditional transistor scaling. It\u2019s already used in some advanced AI chips, such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-mi300\" target=\"_self\">AMD\u2019s MI300 series</a>. And it\u2019s established in the high-bandwidth memory chips that pump data through Nvidia GPUs and other AI processors. The multiple layers of silicon in these 3D stacks are mostly connected by microscopic balls of solder, or in some advanced cases just by their copper terminals. Getting signals and power out of these stacks requires vertical copper links that burrow through the silicon to reach the chip package\u2019s substrate.</p><p>In one of our discussions, Mitra pointed out that a critical issue with 3D-stacked chips is the thermal bottlenecks that form within the stack. In 3D architectures, the traditional heat sinks and other techniques used for 2D chips aren\u2019t sufficient. Extracting heat from each layer is essential.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Our research could redefine thermal management across industries.</p><p>Our experiments on thermal boundary resistance in GaN suggested a similar approach would work in silicon. And when we integrated diamond with silicon, the results were remarkable: An interlayer of silicon carbide formed, leading to diamond with an excellent thermal interface.</p><p>Our effort introduced the concept of thermal scaffolding. In that scheme, nanometers-thick layers of polycrystalline diamond would be integrated within the dielectric layers above the transistors to spread heat. These layers would then be connected by vertical heat conductors, called thermal pillars, made of copper or more diamond. These pillars would connect to another heat spreader, which in turn would link to thermal pillars on the next chip in the 3D stack, and so on until the heat reached the heat sink or other cooling device.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Temperature vs. compute tier graph; AI accelerator heats most without scaffold.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8310e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/temperature-vs-compute-tier-graph-ai-accelerator-heats-most-without-scaffold.png?id=61771384&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The more tiers of computing silicon in a 3D chip, the bigger difference thermal scaffolding makes. An AI accelerator with more than five tiers would well exceed typical temperature limits unless the scaffolding was employed. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Srabanti Chowdhury</small></p>In a collaboration with Mitra, we used simulations of heat generated by real computational workloads to operate a proof-of-concept structure. This structure consisted of dummy heaters to mimic hot spots in a two-chip stack along with diamond heat spreaders and copper thermal pillars. Using this, we <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873424\" target=\"_blank\">reduced the temperature to one-tenth</a> its value without the scaffolding.<p>There are hurdles still to overcome. In particular, we still have to figure out a way to make the top of our diamond coatings atomically flat. But, in collaboration with industry partners and researchers, we are systematically studying that problem and other scientific and technological issues. We and our partners think this research could offer a disruptive new path for thermal management and a crucial step toward sustaining high-performance computing into the future.</p><h2>Developing Diamond Thermal Solutions</h2><p>We now intend to move toward industry integration. For example, we\u2019re working with the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/threads-heat-removal\" target=\"_blank\">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Threads</a> program, which aims to use device-level thermal management to develop highly efficient and reliable X-band power amplifiers with a power density 6 to 8 times as efficient as today\u2019s devices. The program, which was conceived and initially run by <a href=\"https://forward.darpa.mil/presenters/Dr-Thomas-Kazior\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Kazior</a>, is a critical platform for validating the use of low-temperature diamond integration in GaN HEMT manufacturing. It\u2019s enabled us to collaborate closely with industry teams while protecting both our and our partners\u2019 processes. Defense applications demand exceptional reliability, and our diamond-integrated HEMTs are undergoing rigorous testing with industry partners. The early results are promising, guiding refinements in growth processes and integration techniques that we\u2019ll make with our partners over the next two years.</p><p>But our vision extends beyond GaN HEMTs to <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.35848/1882-0786/abf4f1\" target=\"_blank\">other materials</a> and particularly silicon computational chips. For the latter, we have an established collaboration with TSMC, and we\u2019re expanding on newer opportunities with Applied Materials, Micron, Samsung, and others through the <a href=\"https://systemx.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford SystemX Alliance</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.src.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Semiconductor Research Corp.</a> This is an extraordinary level of collaboration among otherwise fierce competitors. But then, heat is a universal challenge in chip manufacturing, and everyone is motivated to find the best solutions.</p><p>If successful, our research could redefine thermal management across industries. In my work on gallium nitride devices, I have seen firsthand how once-radical ideas like this transition to become industry standards, and I believe diamond-based heat extraction will follow the same trajectory, becoming a critical enabler for a generation of electronics that is no longer hindered by heat. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the November 2025 print issue as \u201cDiamond Blankets Will Chill Future Chips.\u201d</em></p>"

By the time they were done, the car contained 302 kilograms of electrical equipment, including a 12-volt ignition system, an extra-large generator, 24 electrical motors, 44 vacuum tubes, 50 lightbulbs, 92 control switches, 29 solenoids, 53 relays, 23 circuit breakers, and 10 fuses, all connected by 16 kilometers of wiring. That\u2019s a lot of electronics, but then again, a lot of gizmos were jammed into the car. Touted as a \u201claboratory on wheels,\u201d the futuristic auto included more than 50 innovations.</p><p>One of the most visible features was the clear, nonglare, heatproof plastic sliding roof panel. At the flick of a lever, the windows rolled down and the top retracted. When an electrical moisture sensor detected a hint of rain, it would automatically seal the car. Alas, the X-100 did not have air conditioning. I\u2019m a South Carolinian, and the thought of an uncooled drive on a sunny, hot August day is, let\u2019s say, unappealing. I suspect the designers, being in Detroit, hadn\u2019t thought through summer in the Deep South.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large 1950s convertible on a curved race track.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d726\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-1950s-convertible-on-a-curved-race-track.jpg?id=61951902&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In this 1953 photo, the Ford X-100\u2019s roof panel is retracted and the windows are down. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>The designers did consider certain types of weather because the windshield wipers could spray hot or cold fluid depending on the outside temperature, and the rear window had a defroster. Another feature that I\u2019m sure wowed people in colder climates were the car\u2019s heated leather seats. The front seats were also electrically adjustable in six positions, with presets for two different drivers.</p><p>The car had a 10-tube, signal-seeking radio with separate controls and speakers for front and rear passengers. The radio itself was tucked out of sight below the dashboard, but a prismatic mirror could be lowered to show the dial.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Retro car dashboard with labeled phone, electric shaver, and steering wheel features.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a65aa\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/retro-car-dashboard-with-labeled-phone-electric-shaver-and-steering-wheel-features.jpg?id=61951890&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100 had a radiophone [top], built-in electric shaver [middle], and multifunction steering wheel with a clock and variable-volume horn [bottom].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>Bluetooth pairing obviously wasn\u2019t available in 1953, but the Ford X-100 did have a radiophone mounted in the center console, through which you could place calls via the Bell System\u2019s Mobile Telephone Service. It also had a dictaphone to record all those great ideas you\u2019d have while driving around with the wind in your hair. One innovation that didn\u2019t stand the test of time was the electric shaver and pop-up mirror stowed away in the glove compartment.</p><p>Each wheel had a built-in hydraulic jack attached to the chassis to easily lift the car when you had to change a tire. (Tubeless tires weren\u2019t yet commonplace, so changing flats was something every driver had to do.) A clock was mounted in the center of the steering wheel, where you\u2019d expect the horn to be. The horn, meanwhile, could be activated by a thin circle surrounding the clock or from buttons on the arms of the steering wheel. It had two different volume settings, softer for city traffic and louder for country roads.</p><p>The transmission had an electrically operated gear selector, which most cars didn\u2019t have at the time. In addition to power steering, there was power braking that included an electric power-assisted hand brake. Electric switches on the instrument panel opened, closed, locked, and unlocked the hood and trunk. Unfortunately, though, there were no mechanical releases to open the hood and trunk if the car lost power.</p><p>The X-100 had a built-in battery charger that could be plugged into an electrical outlet to allow the various gizmos to work even if the car wasn\u2019t running. But not every feature was electrical: Housed in a black leather pouch in front of the center console was a brass pump-style fire extinguisher. Just in case of emergency.</p><h2>The Ford X-100 Was Big in Paris</h2><p>The concept car had its second debut in the summer of 1953 during Ford\u2019s 50th-anniversary celebrations. The anniversary presented a golden opportunity for Henry Ford II to redefine the company, as Douglas Brinkley writes in <a href=\"https://douglasbrinkley.com/books/wheels-for-the-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Wheels for the World</em></em></a><em><em>, </em></em>a sweeping history of Ford published by Penguin in 2003 to celebrate the company\u2019s centennial. For its 50th, Ford produced the film <a href=\"https://www.filmpreservation.org/sponsored-films/screening-room/the-american-road-1953\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The American Road</em></em></a>; an illustrated company history, <em><em>Ford at Fifty: An American Story</em></em>;<em> </em>a two-hour <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281441/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">television special</a> hosted by Edward R. Murrow and featuring Ethel Merman, Mary Martin, and Bing Crosby; and a calendar illustrated by Norman Rockwell.</p><p>As part of this celebration, the Ford X-100 made the European circuit of auto shows. It racked up nearly 10,000 km crisscrossing the continent, driving from Paris to London to Bonn to Cologne and averaging 12 miles per gallon (about 5 km per liter) of gasoline. Despite its gas gauge indicator lights, the X-100 ran out of gas in the middle of the night on its final trip to the French port of Le Havre.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large 1950s car on a circular stage surrounded by a crowd of onlookers.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9b190\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-1950s-car-on-a-circular-stage-surrounded-by-a-crowd-of-onlookers.jpg?id=61951835&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100, shown here in Paris, racked up nearly 30,000 kilometers driving to auto shows, fairs, and dealerships. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</small></p><p>The car also toured the United States, stopping at fairs and dealerships and adding another 12,000 miles (19,300 km) to the odometer. A Ford engineer always accompanied the car to demonstrate the various features and answer any questions.</p><p>The X-100 wasn\u2019t exactly the star of <em><em>Woman\u2019s World, </em></em>but the movie industry estimated that 80 million people saw its features demonstrated on screen<em><em>.</em></em> Four other Ford concept cars also appeared, including the XL-500, the XM-800, and the Ventura, as did a Detroit auto plant.</p><p>Between the movie and the auto shows, Ford estimated that more people saw the X-100 than any other concept car. The company eventually donated the X-100 to <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Henry Ford museum</a>, in Dearborn, Mich., where it went into storage. In 1987, the X-100 went back on public display as part of the <em><em>Automobile in American Life </em></em>exhibit. Although the car isn\u2019t currently on exhibit, it still turns up occasionally at auto shows.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-concept-cars\" target=\"_blank\">Concept-Car Tech Makes Wheels Wise to Well-being</a></p><p>The purpose of a concept car is to excite the public with dreams of a possible future. The Ford X-100 did more than that: It not only embodied aspiration and hope, it actually delivered on many of its promises. Car-connected phones, heated seats, and electric windows may seem commonplace now, but they first had to be imagined. With the exception of that electric shaver, kudos to the Ford engineers of the 1950s for making those dreams a reality.</p><p><em>Part of a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\">continuing series</a> looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></p><p><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the November 2025 print issue as \u201cFord and the Road Mostly Taken.\u201d</em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>I love when I get to watch old movies as part of my research, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBbbgttdqBQ\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Woman\u2019s World</em></a> was fun.

It\u2019s not unusual now to find, say, microcontroller boards with<a href=\"https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-redboard-turbo-samd21-development-board.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> integrated Li-ion chargers</a>. Lithium-ion is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lithium-ion-batteries\" target=\"_blank\">so popular</a>, in fact, that it\u2019s easy to forget that other battery technologies exist, even when they\u2019re a better fit.</p><p>These worthy alternatives include removable rechargeable<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> nickel\u2013metal hydride</a> batteries. While NiMH cells can\u2019t be recharged as many times as lithium-ion cells can and don\u2019t offer the same power density, they\u2019re cheaper and also safer. No need to ship them in boxes emblazoned with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/first-xray-views-into-overheating-lithiumion-batteries\" target=\"_blank\">fire warning labels</a>. The fact that NiMH cells deliver lower voltages than lithium has become less of an issue as the voltage demands of integrated circuits have fallen, with 3.3-volt and 1.8-V chips rapidly displacing the ubiquitous 5-V standard of yesteryear.</p><h2>How to Make NiMH Easier to Manage</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A collection of major components\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f962f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-collection-of-major-components.png?id=61941442&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A handful of 3D-printed parts [bottom], a servo and screen [middle] and a single printed circuit board [top] are all that\u2019s needed for the Spinc charger. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>But it\u2019s also true that recharging removable batteries can be a pain: You have to load them into a charger, which typically holds no more than four batteries at a time, and take care to put them in the right way. Otherwise you get no charging at best and irreversible damage to the cell and even overheating at worst.</p><p>To ease this pain point, I created the Spinc, a DIY device that charges up to seven NiMH AA batteries at a time and automatically figures out the polarity of each cell before charging it; when finished, it drops the batteries into a hopper. You can check on the charging status via a display that doubles as a clock.</p><p>In my day job, I work on industrial vehicles as an EE in a midsize German company. But I came to this project due to a personal interest in low-power electronics and after a fruitless attempt to harvest the last dregs of power from some nonrechargeable batteries. That failure\u2014in a nutshell, my design needed a buffer battery that had to be recharged, which defeated the whole purpose of the project\u2014got me thinking about rechargeable cells.</p><p>The hardest part of creating the Spinc was a self-imposed challenge. I wanted the charger to be compact and intuitive to use. This meant spending a lot of time perfecting the mechanism that takes a battery from the top of the charger, places and holds it between two electrodes while charging, and then drops the battery out the bottom before resetting and grabbing the next cell. A lot of careful iterations later, I had a set of seven 3D-printer files to create the parts that assemble to form the case and mechanism of the Spinc. To that, you just need to add the display, servo motor, and a printed circuit board with all the remaining components, plus an<a href=\"https://www.vishay.com/docs/84274/vcnl4040.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> infrared proximity sensor</a> that detects when a battery has been inserted and is ready to be placed between the charging electrodes.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p><span>To allow the battery to be charged regardless of which way it\u2019s put into the charger, I used a classic</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-bridge\" target=\"_blank\"> H-bridge circuit</a><span>, which is normally used to let DC motors run in either direction, with a few modifications that let it work at low voltages.</span></p><p>I decided to use a dedicated integrated circuit to manage the actual charging, with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor\" target=\"_blank\"> thermistors</a> to watch out for overheating. While I could have used a microcontroller and written my own software to monitor the battery, NiMH cells have a very flat charging curve, and it\u2019s easy to overshoot the charging cycle. Using an IC saved me from a lot of testing, and also gave me the ability to use a fast-charging mode.</p><p>However, it didn\u2019t save me from some trial and error. The first charger IC I used was attractively compact at 2 by 2 millimeters. However, when I tried charging an AA battery, I discovered that the manufacturer assumed the end user would be charging two to four batteries at a time, all hooked up in series. Charging just a single battery meant the IC\u2019s linear voltage regulator had to dissipate more heat than intended, and it quickly burned the chip out. I eventually found a somewhat larger (5.15 by 4.4 mm)<a href=\"https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ds2711-ds2712.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> charger IC</a> that uses a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply\" target=\"_blank\"> switched-mode regulator</a> and could handle the job.

The RP2040 is also responsible for monitoring the proximity sensor and driving the servo that controls the internal feed mechanism, as well as responding to the Spinc\u2019s push-button controls, which let you set the clock and start charging the batteries. The entire device is powered via a USB-C socket.</p><p>Most of the electronics are surface-mounted on a PCB that has a large center cutout to allow the batteries to pass through it. I designed the PCB in<a href=\"https://www.kicad.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> KiCad</a> and had it fabricated by<a href=\"https://jlcpcb.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> JLCPCB</a>. To make it easier to fabricate the boards correctly, I didn\u2019t try to specify 90-degree angles for the corners of the center cutout. Instead, I went with rounded corners, which are easier for the cutting tooling to follow.</p><p>The result is a desktop charger that\u2019s as convenient to use as possible. A full set of PCB schematics, bill of materials, 3D printer files, and firmware files are available from the<a href=\"https://github.com/CoretechR/SPINC\" target=\"_blank\"> project page on GitHub</a>.

Most cancer deaths, for example, are caused by strain from the disease spreading throughout the body, fueled by the few tumor cells able to survive the travel to different body parts and form new growths. But biologists know relatively little about how these aggressive cells function, which hinders knowledge of cancer progression and resistance. </p><p>Oncology isn\u2019t the only field in pursuit of valuable information about single rare cells\u2014fields including developmental biology, immunology, stem cell biology, neuroscience, and infectious disease all require studying individual cells. By looking at cells one at a time rather than in bulk, researchers can uncover their genetic makeup and unique behavior, observing subtle but influential traits that would be otherwise hidden.</p><p>The key to breakthroughs in all of these fields, experts say, is clear: better single-cell sequencing technology. </p><p>To study rare cells, researchers need to separate individual cells from big clumps of human tissue, but doing so threatens the viability of the very cells they hope to analyze. Existing technologies to isolate cells often do so by sawing small pieces off of a larger tissue chunk with a scalpel or razor, potentially damaging the cells so they can no longer be studied properly. Other methods use enzymes to isolate cells, but those procedures are time consuming and can threaten useful cell characteristics. \u201cAnd for rare cell types, every little loss counts,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/susztaklab/pi.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Katalin Susztak</a>, who studies chronic kidney disease at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Hypersonic Levitation in Cell Isolation</h2><p>A new method of isolating and suspending cells, called <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00497-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hypersonic levitation and spinning</a> (HLS), relies on acoustic resonators and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/mems-at-40/\" target=\"_self\">micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)</a> technology to yield biology breakthroughs. The group from Tianjin University in China responsible for its development found that the tool is able to isolate more cells in substantially less time than traditional techniques. </p><p>HLS uses a metal probe to transmit billions of vibrations per second into a water mixture surrounding human cancer tissue in a research lab.

They started by considering the fact that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-protein-localization\" target=\"_self\">living cells</a> are generally surrounded by water. \u201cWe asked: could we use a finely tuned physical field within the fluid itself to act as a gentle, invisible hand?\u201d Duan says.</p><p>They came up with a small, high-frequency <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes\" target=\"_self\">ultrasound</a> probe that uses three MEMS-based resonators to vibrate tissue in a water and enzyme solution. When the device is turned on, a signal generated at 2.49 gigahertz alerts a printed circuit board to send out a high-frequency voltage. Once the voltage reaches the MEMS resonators, an <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/piezoelectric-effect#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cinverse%20piezoelectric%20effect%E2%80%9D%20refers,called%20the%20%E2%80%9Celectrostrictive%20effect%E2%80%9D.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inverse piezoelectric effect</a> is triggered, yielding billions of vibrations per second that generate acoustic waves in the surrounding fluid.</p><p>A reflector beneath each resonator bounces the waves in a specific pattern, causing the water-enzyme mixture to start flowing and spinning quickly\u2014creating liquid jets powerful enough to remove a single cell from a clump of tissue, but gentle enough to do so without deterioration. Once a cell is isolated, the same acoustic mechanisms allow it to float and spin freely in the fluid.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p>While much of the design is unique, HLS is more of a refinement than a completely new device. \u201cThis levitation method has been used before for other types of work,\u201d says <a href=\"https://web.mae.ufl.edu/hfan/Dr.Fan.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Z.

He says that HLS \u201cis an improvement, not a dramatic change.\u201d Still, Fan thinks the tool shows serious potential. </p><p>The Tianjin University researchers tested their device on human renal cancer tissue samples. Using HLS, the group was able to isolate 90 percent of cells in 15 minutes, but could only do the same for 70 percent of cells in an hour using conventional methods. HLS performed so well because it helps the enzymes penetrate the tissue and break up cells \u201cwithout the need for harsh mechanical grinding or prolonged enzymatic exposure,\u201d Duan says.</p><h2>Concerns Over HLS in Single-Cell Research</h2><p>The biggest concern from University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Susztak is that HLS may pose a threat to cells sensitive to high-frequencies. \u201cEven slight perturbations matter in single-cell work,\u201d she says. \u201cWill the acoustic fields perturb the cell\u2019s biochemistry?\u201d</p><p>Duan is confident that his team\u2019s design is safe for fragile cells because they experience a controlled force, not the raw acoustic wave, he claims. \u201cThis intense force field is confined to the fluid, not the cell directly.\u201d</p><p>Outside experts have more concerns about implementation. Susztak notes that \u201cbiological labs are unforgiving\u201d so research tools must be reliable and robust, and MEMS devices in fluid tend to face drift and calibration issues. Cost and ease of access concern Fan, though he thinks that both issues could be solved by business efforts. \u201cHow mainstream it will become is really dependent on commercialization,\u201d he says. </p><p>For these reasons and others, Duan says that his team has spun HLS into a startup company\u2014Convergency Biotech\u2014with the goal to develop HLS workstations user-friendly enough for any lab. And he\u2019s optimistic about the enterprise. \u201cWe believe MEMS-based acoustic tools will become a mainstream component of the biological toolkit,\u201d he says.</p><p>Single-cell researchers show similar optimism, but in the company of caution. Susztak considers HLS \u201ca clever tool with genuine promise,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it must prove itself in the messy world of real biology.\u201d</p>"

The competition, called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-blackwell-mlperf-training-5\" target=\"_self\">MLPerf</a>, consists of a set of tasks for training specific AI models, on predefined datasets, to a certain accuracy. Essentially, these tasks, called benchmarks, test how well a hardware and low-level software configuration is set up to train a particular AI model. </p><p>Twice a year, companies put together their submissions\u2014usually, clusters of CPUs and GPUs and software optimized for them\u2014and compete to see whose submission can train the models fastest. </p><p>There is no question that since MLPerf\u2019s inception, the cutting-edge hardware for AI training has improved dramatically. Over the years, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a> has <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/tesla-v100/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">four</a> <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new</a> <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">generations</a> of GPUs that have since become the industry standard (the latest, Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPU, is not yet standard but growing in popularity).

So each time a new benchmark is introduced, the fastest training time gets longer.

Rondo\u2019s system converts cheap renewable electricity into heat that can be discharged on demand into industrial processes.</p><p>This differs from most next-generation energy storage strategies, which provide electricity to grids in the absence of sun or wind. Instead, Rondo\u2019s system aims to help decarbonize emissions-heavy sectors like steelmaking and cement.</p><p>The system works like a toaster crossed with a blast furnace. Electricity from solar arrays heat iron wires similar to those in a toaster oven. These warm hundreds of tonnes of refractory bricks to temperatures up to 1,500 \u00b0C. After four to six hours of charging a day, the heat can be discharged as air or steam, without combustion or emissions.</p><p>To discharge heat, a circulating air blower is turned on, pushing air up through the brick stack and heating it to over 1,000 \u00b0C before releasing it through an outlet. The heat delivery rate can be controlled by adjusting the air flow. The battery can discharge steam instead of heat by injecting water into an attached chamber that the heated air passes through before leaving the battery through the outlet.</p><p>The real challenge in thermal energy storage is not storing heat; it\u2019s being able to charge rapidly and then deliver heat continuously at the same temperature, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-o-donnell/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John O\u2019Donnell</a>, Rondo Energy\u2019s chief innovation officer. The structure of Rondo\u2019s heat battery, which O\u2019Donnell describes as \u201ca 3D checkerboard of brick and open chambers,\u201d keeps temperatures uniform and enables rapid charging. \u201cWe can turn charging circuits on and off as fast as you can turn your toaster on and off,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. \u201cSo we can be agile.\u201d</p><p>In Rondo\u2019s first project, its 100-megawatt-hour battery is supplying heat for an enhanced oil recovery facility operated by Holmes Western Oil Corp. in Kern County, California. The battery, which is about the size of a small office building, is powered by an off-grid, 20-MW solar array built for this purpose. It converts the clean electricity into heat, and then generates steam that is injected into oil wells, heating the oil so that it thins out and flows more easily, increasing production.</p><p>Holmes Western Oil previously accomplished this with a gas-fired boiler. Cutting it will save Holmes just under 13,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions annually while also lowering costs, according to Rondo. \u201cMaking steam for oil fields is the second largest portion of industrial heat in the state,\u201d says O\u2019Donnell.</p><p>Rondo\u2019s choice to deploy its first commercial-scale, emissions-reducing battery for the extraction of a fossil fuel <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/17/good-news-bad-news-as-rondo-energy-100-mwh-heat-storage-facility-goes-live/\" target=\"_blank\">stirred some controversy.</a> Critics argue that deploying clean tech to improve or prolong fossil fuel production is counter-productive.</p><h2>Thermal Batteries for Clean Industrial Heat</h2><p>Several <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/polar-night-energy-sand-battery\" target=\"_blank\">other companies</a> are developing thermal batteries with industrial heat applications. <a href=\"https://www.antora.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Antora Energy</a> makes modular <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/could-storing-electricity-in-whitehot-blocks-give-supercheap-renewables-storage\" target=\"_self\">carbon-block heat batteries</a> that can reach over 1,500 \u00b0C and are being deployed at pilot industrial sites. <a href=\"https://energy-nest.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EnergyNest</a> is doing early commercial installations of its concrete-based thermal modules, and is partnering with Siemens Energy to scale across Europe. <a href=\"https://calectra.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Calectra</a>\u2019s ultra-high-temperature systems are in the pilot phase, and <a href=\"https://www.earthen.energy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EarthEn Energy</a> launched its modular low-temperature heat batteries in July.</p><p>These companies are focused on heat because it\u2019s central to producing staples such as steel, cement, food and chemicals. Many of these manufacturing processes run continuously and maintain high temperatures for weeks or months at a time, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/pasteurization\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">72 \u00b0C for pasteurizing milk</a> to over 1,000 \u00b0C for <a href=\"https://britishsteel.co.uk/what-we-do/how-we-make-steel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">making steel</a> or cement.</p><p>The cheapest, most efficient way to produce consistent heat has long been with fossil fuels; nothing burns as slow and hot as coal or natural gas. Their energy density, reliability, and low cost have made them hard to replace. However, industrial heat accounts for <a href=\"https://www.wbcsd.org/news/industrial-heat-an-overlooked-piece-in-the-decarbonization-puzzle/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about 18 percent</a> of greenhouse gas emissions and <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/industrials-and-electronics/our-insights/tackling-heat-electrification-to-decarbonize-industry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 20 percent</a> of global energy consumption. So innovators aiming to decarbonize these industrial sectors have their work cut out for them.</p><p>But solar power is getting cheaper. In 2024, California\u2019s solar fields <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">generated</a> almost as much electricity as its gas plants. \u201cBecause of what the wind and solar industry have done, we now have intermittent grid prices that are cheaper than fuel in a lot of places in the world,\u201d says O\u2019Donnell. Some locations generate so much clean power that the grid can\u2019t absorb it all, forcing negative electricity prices<a href=\"https://emp.lbl.gov/publications/plentiful-electricity-turns-wholesale\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> for a few hours a day.</a></p><h2>How Can Thermal Batteries Scale?</h2><p>Thermal batteries supplying heat face several challenges. In order for them to scale, industrial customers must buy renewable electricity wholesale at times of day when it\u2019s cheap, which requires dynamic real-time pricing. Many states only allow industrial customers to buy power at fixed daily rates. \u201cWe are really eager to see the regulatory framework get modernized,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says.</p><p>The price of natural gas plays a role, too. It\u2019s relatively inexpensive in the United States thanks to shale gas from fracking, but if its price increases due to exports or other factors, batteries like Rondo\u2019s could become a cheaper source of heat. This is already the case in European countries such as Germany, where the <a href=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/en/germany/natural-gas-price-household-consumers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">price of natural gas</a> has skyrocketed in the last three and a half years.</p><p>Plus, heat batteries could be difficult to integrate into existing industrial infrastructure. Not every facility has space for a battery the size of an office building and a dedicated solar array. The batteries\u2019 high up-front costs and the fact that they\u2019re still a largely unproven technology will make some would-be customers reluctant to give them a try.</p><p>Nonetheless, heat batteries like Rondo\u2019s are a promising solution for decarbonizing the industrial sector. \u201cThe thermal storage market is absolutely capable of accelerating to create meaningful impact,\u201d says Blaine Collison, executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.renewablethermal.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Renewable Thermal Collaborative</a>, a coalition focused on decarbonizing thermal energy. \u201cWhen I look at some of the fundamental characteristics of the technology\u2014relatively straightforward materials, ability to off-take renewable electricity, modularity\u2014I see scale.\u201d</p><p>This article was updated on October 31, 2025.</p>"
