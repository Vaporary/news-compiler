        "summary": "We study the medium and long term impacts of Skills for Effective Entrepreneurship Development (SEED), a 3-week entrepreneurship training program for secondary school students in Uganda. The mini-MBA, modeled after business school curricula, was implemented as a randomized field experiment with a nationally representative sample of 4,402 youth. After four years, the training improved both hard and soft skills. SEED graduates became more effective negotiators and communicators and exhibited improved self-efficacy, stability, plasticity, and stress management. In the medium run, treated youth were more likely to start enterprises and more successful in ensuring their survival, thereby gaining greater entrepreneurial experience. Their ventures were also of higher quality: more likely to be formal, have employees, be in collaboration with other entrepreneurs, and use effective business management practices. With 52% of the sample still enrolled in post-secondary education, we find suggestive evidence that businesses led by the treatment groups performed better. After nine years, business ownership converged between treatment and control groups as control ownership rates doubled. However, SEED graduates maintained their edge in terms of business quality and operated firms with 20% higher revenues and 16% higher profits, without corresponding increases in capital or labor inputs, consistent with higher total factor productivity. Entrepreneurial success was achieved through the adoption of better business practices and experimentation, with soft skills related to entrepreneurial mindset playing a complementary role. SEED generated high returns on investment: the present discounted values of SEED-induced business and total earnings equal 20 and 27 times program costs, respectively."

        "summary": "We construct an international panel data set comprising three distinct yet plausible measures of government indebtedness: the debt-to-GDP, the interest-to-GDP, and the debt-to-equity ratios. Our analysis reveals that these measures yield differing conclusions about recent trends in government indebtedness. While the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached historically high levels, the other two indicators show either no clear trend or a declining pattern over recent decades. We argue for the development of stronger theoretical foundations for the measures employed in the literature, suggesting that, without such grounding, assertions about debt (un)sustainability may be premature."

        "summary": "Many temporary foreign worker programs issue \u201cclosed\u201d visas that effectively tie workers to a single employer, restricting worker mobility and weakening bargaining power. We study the labor market return to temporary foreign workers (TFWs) gaining permanent residency (PR), which loosens this mobility restriction. Using administrative data linking matched employer-employee data in Canada to temporary and permanent visa records from 2004\u20132014 along with an event-study design, we find that gaining PR leads to a sharp, immediate, and persistent increase in the job switching rate of 21.7 percentage points and an increase in earnings of 5.7 percent three years after PR. Workers also sort into high-wage firms after gaining PR, and the increase in the firm pay premium is roughly 56 percent of the total earnings gain. We find larger earnings gains for job switchers across industries, low-skilled workers, and workers from low-income countries. To guide and interpret our reduced-form results, we develop a search-and-matching model featuring heterogeneous workers and firms. Permanent residents and native-born workers search for jobs in the same labor market and engage in on-the-job search, while TFWs search separately within a segmented labor market and do not receive outside wage offers. We calibrate the model to match our reduced-form results, and we use it to simulate the long-run effects of PR and consider two counterfactual policies: (1) increasing the cost to firms of posting a TFW vacancy and (2) allowing TFWs to switch employers freely under \u201copen\u201d visas. We evaluate how these policies affect output, wages, profits, and overall social welfare."

        "summary": "This paper introduces an endogenous network of payment chains into a business cycle model. Motivated by evidence of linked payments across firms in Costa Rica, we develop a framework where production orders form bilateral relations: some payments are executed immediately, while others---chained payments---are delayed until upstream payments are received. These chains capture real-world situations in which firms must wait to be paid before paying their own suppliers, leaving resources temporarily idle even when demand and capacity exist. In equilibrium, agents choose the amount of chained payments given interest rates and access to internal funds or credit lines. This choice determines the payment-chain network and aggregate total-factor productivity (TFP). The paper characterizes equilibrium dynamics and pecuniary externalities when agents internalize their own payment delays but not the delays imposed on others."

        "summary": "We construct a new dataset of FOMC meeting transcripts from 1966 to 1990 to analyze the sources of heterogeneity in individual monetary policy preferences and study how this heterogeneity shapes policy decisions. Using these detailed discussions, we manually quantify and characterize each FOMC participants\u2019 preferred policies along with their reasoning and justification. We show that participants' beliefs about the effects of monetary policy\u2014specifically, their perceived slope of the Phillips Curve\u2014play a central role. Participants who believe monetary policy has stronger effects on real activity are more likely to cite output as a justification for easing, while those perceiving stronger price effects emphasize inflation as a reason for tightening. We then show that the Chair plays a unique and powerful role in reconciling these views, not just in setting policy rates, but also in minimizing dissent. The latter occurs because dissenters find their ability to influence policy in subsequent meetings is significantly curtailed."

That decision may ultimately increase pressure on global businesses to reduce their contributions to climate change.</p><h2>Multinationals put pressure on supply chains</h2><p>Multinational companies\u2019 efforts to reduce their climate impact puts pressure on their suppliers \u2013 meaning many more companies must take their climate impact into consideration.</p><p>For instance, U.S.-based Walmart operates over 10,000 stores across <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/about/location-facts\">19 countries</a> and is the largest single buyer of goods in the world. That means it faces a wide range of regulations, including tracking and reducing emissions from its suppliers. In 2017, it launched Project Gigaton, aiming to cut 1 gigaton of supply-chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Suppliers including Nestle, Unilever, Coca Cola, Samsung and Hanes helped the company <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/02/21/walmart-suppliers-lead-the-charge-help-deliver-project-gigaton-goal-more-than-six-years-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reach its target six years early</a> through practical measures such as boosting energy efficiency, redesigning packaging, and reducing food waste. <span>While the data is verified through internal quality controls co-developed with NGOs like the Environmental Defense Fund, analysts at </span><span><a href=\"https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CTA100-Walmart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Planet Tracker</a></span> note that these \u201cavoided\u201d emissions haven\u2019t yet stopped Walmart\u2019s absolute footprint from rising alongside its business growth.</p><p><span>In early 2025, this growth led Walmart to </span><span><a href=\"https://trellis.net/article/walmart-2025-esg-update/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>push back its interim deadlines</span></a></span> for two of its most ambitious emissions reduction targets.

Moreover<span>, </span>almost half of its electricity worldwide came from renewable energy in 2024, its emissions per unit of revenue fell, and it is still targeting zero emissions from its operations by 2040.</p><h2>There are profits to be made in clean tech</h2><p>In addition to facing pressure from buyers and governments, companies see profits to be made from investing in climate-friendly clean technology.</p><p>Since 2016, investments in clean energy have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/energy-environment/trump-renewable-energy-batteries.html\">outpaced that of fossil fuels</a> globally. This trend has only hastened, with nearly twice as much invested in clean energy as fossil fuels in 2025.</p><p></p><p>Lately, myriad <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00743-7\">new business opportunities</a> for multinational companies and start-ups alike have focused on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/amazon-sustainability-officers-ai-tool-climate-change/\">meeting AI\u2019s energy demand</a> through clean energy.</p><p>From 2014 to 2024, the climate tech sector yielded total <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/q1-2025/\">returns of nearly 200 percent</a> , and U.S. investment in climate tech was <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">still growing in 2025</a>.</p><p>In the first half of 2025, <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">close to one-fifth</a> of the over 1,600 venture deals in climate tech were made by corporations for strategic reasons, such as technology access, supply chain integration, or future product offerings. <span>Corporate strategic deals continued to represent about </span><a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NZI_2025-State-of-Climate-Tech-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>20 to 23 percent</span></a> of all climate tech equity transactions through the third and fourth quarters of 2025.</p><p><span>However, this surge in investment is more than a search for profit; it is a defensive necessity as the tech industry\u2019s growth begins to collide with its environmental limits.</span></p><h2>The AI energy paradox</h2><p><span>The rapid expansion of AI is forcing multinational companies to make explicit choices about their climate priorities. While tech leaders once relied on annual renewable credits to meet climate targets, the scale of the AI power boom is forcing more rigorous carbon accounting. Global data centers are </span><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai\" target=\"_blank\"><span>projected</span></a> to consume more electricity than Japan by 2030, a shift that turns \u201cvoluntary\u201d climate investments into a core business requirement for securing 24/7 energy supplies.</p><p><span>In 2025, the tech giants\u2019 own reports revealed the scale of AI emissions. Microsoft\u2019s 2025 Environmental Sustainability Report revealed a 23.4 percent </span><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/29/environmental-sustainability-report/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>increase</span></a> in total emissions since its 2020 baseline. Similarly, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2025-environmental-report/\">emissions have climbed 51 percent since 2019</a>, with a 22 percent surge in Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions in 2024 alone. <span>Amazon\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2024-report\" target=\"_blank\"><span>2024 Sustainability Report</span></a> noted a 33 percent jump since 2019 driven by the construction of new data centers. Meta\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2025-sustainability-report/\">supplier\u2019s emissions (99 percent of its total footprint) are being driven to new heights</a> by the \u201cembodied carbon\u201d of AI hardware.</p><p><span>While high costs might tempt some to cut corners, climate action could instead become a hedge against energy volatility. C</span>ompanies like Amazon and Google are securing reliable supply by leveraging <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\">federal fast-tracking of nuclear permits</a> to act as primary offtakers for the first generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). <span>This shift is accelerated by new federal orders to bypass nuclear licensing hurdles, as seen in Google\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/google-and-kairos-power-team-up-for-smr-deployments-in-us-first\" target=\"_blank\"><span>landmark agreement with Kairos Power</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/amazon-invests-in-x-energy-unveils-smr-project-plans\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Amazon\u2019s $500 million investment in X-energy</span></a><span>\u2014deals designed to secure the 24/7 \u201cbaseload\u201d power AI requires without abandoning carbon-free commitments.

Oil and gas companies, for example, <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/oil-and-gas-investment-is-more-important-than-ever\">continue to invest</a> in new oil and gas development. However, they also forecast <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/all-energy-types-are-needed\">renewable energy growth accelerating</a> and are investing in clean tech.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6016/chapter/5709986/Consumer-Facing-and-Carbon-Intensive-Sectors-A\">corporate leaders I interviewed</a>, from tech companies like Intel to sporting goods and apparel companies like Adidas, talked about aligning sustainability efforts and initiatives across their business globally whenever possible. This proactive approach allows them to more seamlessly collect data and respond to pressures arising domestically and globally, minimizing the need for costly patchwork efforts later. Moreover, global businesses know they will continue to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/feliciajackson/2025/11/07/international-standards-could-turn-net-zero-into-common-practice/\">face demands</a> from their customers, investors and employees to be better stewards of the planet.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges</p><p><span>In a 2025 Getty Images </span><a href=\"http://reports.gettyimages.com/VisualGPS-Visualizing-Sustainability-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>survey</span></a> of over 5,000 consumers across 25 countries, more than 80 percent of respondents reported that they expect clear ESG guidelines from businesses. Furthermore, these consumers\u2014from Brazil, Australia and Japan to the UK and US\u2014are increasingly using GenAI-driven shopping assistants to filter for \u201cresponsible business\u201d practices.</p><p><span>U.S. market </span><a href=\"https://www.hartman-group.com/reports/274144747/sustainability-2025-do-consumers-care\" target=\"_blank\"><span>research</span></a> from the Hartman Group corroborates this trend<span>: 71 percent of surveyed food and beverage consumers consider environmental and social impacts in their purchasing decisions.

The divergence between federal deregulation in Washington and the rigid physical demands of the AI revolution has created a new era of corporate pragmatism. While some firms may use political shifts to \u201cgreenhush\u201d or delay abstract pledges, the world\u2019s largest corporations are finding that they cannot simply account away the massive energy and infrastructure requirements of the AI Age. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges. In this new landscape, the global businesses that thrive will be those that build carbon-free foundations, while responding to existing and future laws across the globe.</span></p><p><em>This article is adapted by the author from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

For elderly or disabled drivers, those bulky cords can <a href=\"https://www.ridc.org.uk/transport/inaccessible-charging-barrier-electric-disabled-and-older-drivers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">be a physical challenge.</a></p><p>As it was for smartphones years ago, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-charging\" target=\"_self\">wireless EV charging</a> has been the dream. But there\u2019s a difference of nearly four orders of magnitude between the roughly 14 watt-hours of a typical smartphone battery and that of a large EV. That\u2019s what makes the wireless charging on the 108-kilowatt-hour pack in the forthcoming Porsche Cayenne Electric so notable.</p><p>To offer the first inductive charger on a production car, Porsche had to overcome both technical and practical challenges\u2014such as how to protect a beloved housecat prowling below your car. The German automaker demonstrated the system at September\u2019s <a href=\"https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2025/products/porsche-demonstrates-inductive-charging-at-iaa.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IAA Mobility</a> show in Munich.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>With its <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a65810736/2026-porsche-cayenne-electric-prototype-drive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-volt architecture</a>, the Cayenne Electric can charge at up to 400 kW at a public DC station, enough to fill its pack from 10 to 80 percent in about 16 minutes. The wireless system delivers about 11 kW for Level 2 charging at home, where Porsche says three out of four of its customers do nearly all their fill-ups. Pull the Cayenne into a garage and align it over a floor-mounted plate, and the SUV will charge from 10 to 80 percent in about 7.5 hours. No plugs, tangled cords, or dirty hands. Porsche will offer a single-phase, 48-ampere version for the United States after buyers see their first Cayennes in mid-2026, and a <a href=\"https://cc-techgroup.com/single-phase-vs-three-phase-power/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">three-phase</a>, 16-A system in Europe.</p><h2>Porsche\u2019s Wireless Charging is Based on an Old Concept</h2><p>The concept of inductive charging has been around for more than a century. Two coils of copper wire are positioned near one another. A current flowing through one coil creates a magnetic field, which induces voltage in the second coil.</p><p>In the Porsche system, the floor-mounted pad, 78 centimeters wide, plugs into the home\u2019s electrical panel. Inside the pad, which weighs 50 kilograms, grid electricity (at 60 hertz in the United States, 50 Hz in most of the rest of the world) is converted to DC and then to high-frequency AC at 2,000 V.The resulting <a href=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1493137\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">85-kilohertz</a> magnetic field extends from the pad to the Cayenne, where it is converted again to DC voltage.</p><p>The waterproof pad can also be placed outdoors, and the company says it\u2019s unaffected by leaves, snow, and the like. In fact, the air-cooled pad can get warm enough to melt any snow, reaching temperatures as high as 50 \u00b0C.</p><p>The Cayenne\u2019s onboard charging hardware mounts between its front electric motor and battery. The 15-kg induction unit wires directly into the battery.</p><p>In most EVs, plug-in (conductive) AC charging tops out at <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36062942/evs-explained-charging-losses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">around 95 percent</a> efficiency. Porsche says its wireless system delivers 90 percent efficiency, despite an air gap of roughly 12 to 18 cm between the pad and vehicle.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory transferred an impressive <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kilowatts</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency.</span></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re super proud that we\u2019re just below conductive AC in charging efficiency,\u201d says Simon Schulze, Porsche\u2019s product manager for charging hardware. Porsche also beats inductive phone chargers, which typically max out at about 70 percent efficiency, Schulze says.</p><p>When the car gets within 7.5 meters of the charging pad, the Cayenne\u2019s screen-based parking-assist system turns on automatically. Then comes a kind of video game that requires the driver to align a pair of green circles on-screen, one representing the car, the other the pad. It\u2019s like a digital version of the tennis ball some people hang in their garage to gauge parking distance. There\u2019s ample wiggle room, with tolerances of 20 cm left to right, and 15 cm fore and aft. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss it,\u201d according to Schulze.</p><p>Induction loops detect any objects between the charging plate and the vehicle; such objects, if they\u2019re metal, could heat up dangerously. Radar sensors detect any living things near the pad, and will halt the charging if necessary. People can walk near the car or hop aboard without affecting a charging session.</p><p>Christian Holler, Porsche\u2019s head of charging systems, says the system conforms to International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection standards for electromagnetic radiation. The field remains below 15 microteslas, so it\u2019s safe for <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/devices-that-may-interfere-with-icds-and-pacemakers\" target=\"_blank\">people with pacemakers</a>, Porsche insists. And the aforementioned cat wouldn\u2019t be harmed even if it strayed into the magnetic field, though \u201cits metal collar might get warm,\u201d Schulze says.</p><p>The Porsche system\u2019s 90 percent efficiency is impressive but not record-setting. Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) transferred <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kW</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency, boosting its state of charge by 50 percent in 10 minutes. That <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-ev-charging-2668791896\" target=\"_self\">world-record wireless rate</a> relied on polyphase windings for coils, part of a U.S. Department of Energy project that was backed by Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company.</p><p>That effort, Holler says, spawned a Ph.D. paper from VW engineer <a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/9126/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Foote</a>. Yet the project had different goals from the one that led to the Cayenne charging system. ORNL was focused on maximum power transfer, regardless of cost, production feasibility, or reliability, he says.</p><p>By contrast, designing a system for showroom cars \u201crequires a completely different level of quality and processes,\u201d Holler says.</p><h2>High Cost Could Limit Adoption</h2><p> Cayenne buyers in Europe will pay around \u20ac7,000 (roughly US $8,100) for the optional charger. Porsche has yet to price it for the United States.</p><p> Loren McDonald, chief executive of Chargeonomics, an EV-charging analysis firm, said wireless charging \u201cis clearly the future,\u201d with use cases such as driverless robotaxis, curbside charging, or at any site \u201cwhere charging cables might be an annoyance or even a safety issue.\u201d</p><p>But for now, inductive charging\u2019s costly, low-volume status will limit it to niche models and high-income adopters, McDonald says. Public adoption will be critical \u201cso that drivers can convenience-charge throughout their driving day\u2014which then increases the benefits of spending more money on the system.\u201d</p><p>Porsche acknowledges that issue; the system conforms to wireless standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers so that other automakers might help popularize the technology.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want this to be proprietary, a Porsche-only solution,\u201d Schulze says. \u201cWe only benefit if other brands use it.\u201d</p>"

A perfectly coiffed woman from the secretarial pool then takes the recordings and neatly types them up, with carbon copies of course.</p><p>I had no idea the Dictaphone actually had its roots in the 19th century and a rivalry between two early tech giants: Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison. And although it took decades to take hold in the modern office, it found novel uses in other fields.</p><h2>Who invented the Dictaphone?</h2><p>The Dictaphone was born from the competition and the cooperation of Bell and Edison and their capable teams of researchers. In 1877, Edison had introduced <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/edisons-phonograph\" target=\"_blank\">the phonograph</a>, which he later declared <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2022/03/thomas-edisons-favorite-invention-the-phonograph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his favorite invention</a>. And yet he wasn\u2019t quite certain about its commercial applications. Initially, he thought it might be good for recording telephone messages. Then he began to imagine other uses: a mechanical stenographer for businessmen, a notetaker for students, an elocution instructor, a talking book for the blind.

In 1880, the French government had awarded Bell the Volta Prize and 50,000 francs (about US $10,000 at the time) for his invention of the telephone. The following year, he, his cousin Chichester A. Bell, and Charles Sumner Tainter used the prize money to found the Volta Laboratory Association in Washington, D.C., to do research on sound recording and transmission.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/particle-physics-resurrects-alexander-graham-bells-voice\" target=\"_self\">Particle Physics Resurrects Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s Voice</a></p><p>Tainter saw potential in the phonograph. Edison\u2019s version used a needle to etch sound waves on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a metal cylinder. The foil was easily damaged, the sound quality was distorted and squeaky, and the cylinder could be replayed only a few times before degrading and becoming inaudible. Edison\u2019s phonograph couldn\u2019t be easily commercialized, in other words.</p><p>Chichester Bell and Tainter greatly improved the sound quality by replacing the tinfoil with <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\" target=\"_blank\">wax-coated cardboard cylinders</a>.

As a \u201cdictator,\u201d you would speak into the tube, and a stylus would trace the sound wave on the wax cylinder. The cylinder would then be handed off to a secretary for transcription. Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary.</p><p>A manufacturing company set up by Volta Lab sold several machines to the U.S. government. One enthusiastic early adopter was Edward D. Easton, a noted stenographer for the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Easton took notes in shorthand, he immediately recited his notes into the Graphophone after each session.</p><p>Easton became an evangelist for the instrument, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Phonogram1_4/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">writing glowing accounts</a> in a trade magazine. The machine made no mistakes and could take dictation as fast as the speaker could articulate. The phonograph never complained when a transcriber needed a phrase repeated. The phonograph didn\u2019t suffer from poor penmanship. Anyone could learn to use the machine in two weeks or less, compared to months or years to master stenography. Such were Easton\u2019s claims. (Easton was such a fan that he cofounded the Columbia Phonograph Co., which went on to become a leading maker of phonographs and recorded music and lives on today as <a href=\"https://www.columbiarecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia Records</a>.)</p><p>Before long, several companies were manufacturing and selling phonographs and dictation machines. Even though demand was initially light, patent-infringement lawsuits sprang up, which soon threatened to bankrupt all of the companies involved. Finally, in 1896, the various parties agreed to stop fighting and to cross-license each other\u2019s intellectual property. This didn\u2019t end the Bell-Edison rivalry, but it allowed the phonograph business to take off in earnest, aided by the sales of mass-produced recorded music cylinders. And the accepted name for this entertainment machine became the phonograph.</p><h2>The Dictaphone Gets Down to Business</h2><p>But Bell, Tainter, and Edison didn\u2019t forget the original promise of mechanical stenography, and the rivals soon came out with competing and very similar products designed specifically for dictation: the Dictaphone and the Ediphone. The public found it difficult to distinguish the two products, and it wasn\u2019t long before \u201cdictaphone\u201d was being used to describe all dictation machines. (The Columbia Graphophone Co. trademarked \u201cDictaphone\u201d in 1907\u2014a confusing neologism of <em><em>dicta</em></em> from the Latin for \u201csayings\u201d or \u201csay repeatedly\u201d and <em><em>phone</em></em> from the Greek for \u201cvoice\u201d or \u201csound.\u201d)</p><p>As David Morton recounts in his 1999 book <em><em>Off the Record</em></em> (Rutgers University Press), Dictaphone sales accelerated as scientific management for business began to take root. Office managers intent on streamlining, standardizing, and systemizing workflows saw the Dictaphone as a labor-saving device. In 1912, for instance, an efficiency commission set up by U.S. President William Taft endorsed the use of dictation machines in government offices. The railroad and insurance industries followed suit as they standardized their financial records. Later, managers began using dictation machines to conquer their business correspondence.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an older man with a moustache holding a tube near his mouth.

The U.S. government was an early adopter of the machines.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Library of Congress</small></p><p>And yet, the Dictaphone wasn\u2019t obviously destined to become an indispensable piece of office equipment like the typewriter. In 1923, for instance, 15,000 dictation machines were sold in the United States, versus 744,000 typewriters.</p><p>In 1926, the Dictaphone Corp. tried to drum up interest by sponsoring Henry Lunn, founder of a large U.K. travel company, on an around-the-world lecture tour. At each hotel he visited, the company ensured there was a Dictaphone for Lunn to record his diary. Consider this a prototype for the modern hotel business center. At the end of his journey, Lunn published <em><em>Round the World With a Dictaphone</em></em>\u2014part travelogue, part proselytizing for Christian churches to support the League of Nations, and part Dictaphone promotion. Even so, by 1945, Dictaphone estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of the potential market had been captured.</p><p>There were social reasons working against dictation machines, Morton says in his book. Executives relied on their secretaries not only for dictation and transcription, but also for their often unacknowledged aid in prompting, correcting, and filling in their bosses\u2019 thoughts\u2014the soft skills that a machine could not replace.</p><p>Morton also attributes the slow uptake to the technology itself. One quirk of the Dictaphone is that it continued to use wax cylinders long after phonograph players had switched to discs. Transcribers often complained that the wax recordings were unintelligible\u2014dictators needed to speak directly into the speaking tube, loudly, clearly, and at an appropriate pace, but many did not.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman sitting at a manual typewriter and wearing headphones that connect to a machine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"df276\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-sitting-at-a-manual-typewriter-and-wearing-headphones-that-connect-to-a-machine.jpg?id=62564524&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A secretary plays back the sound from a recorded Ediphone cylinder in 1930 to transcribe the cylinder\u2019s contents.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Popperfoto/Getty Images</small></p><p>During World War II, Dictaphone finally ditched the wax cylinders in favor of etching grooves on a plastic belt, although the new machines were available only to U.S. government agencies until the end of the war. In 1947, the company publicly introduced the new technology with its Time-Master series. Each Dictabelt held about 15 minutes of recording. Meanwhile, Edison\u2019s Ediphone was rebranded the <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2016/09/15/take-a-memo/\" target=\"_blank\">Voicewriter</a> and recorded on distinctive red plastic discs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a rectangular device with a long cord and microphone and 3 reddish discs with a hole in the middle. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f63d1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-rectangular-device-with-a-long-cord-and-microphone-and-3-reddish-discs-with-a-hole-in-the-middle.jpg?id=62564655&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This 1953 Edison Voicewriter recorded the speaker\u2019s voice on plastic Diamond Discs. Magnetic tape came later.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian Design Museum/Smithsonian Institution</small></p><p>In the 1960s, Dictaphone finally embraced magnetic recording tape, in the form of cassette tapes. Pressure initially came from European companies, such as the Dutch electronics company Philips, which entered the U.S. market in 1958 with a low-priced tape-cartridge machine. Four years later, Philips introduced the Compact Cassette, which became the basis of today\u2019s audio cassette. Transistorized electronics furthered miniaturization and made dictation machines much more portable. Eventually, solid-state storage replaced magnetic tape, and today, we all carry around a dictation device with an effectively infinite recording time via cloud storage, and, if we choose to use it, automatic transcription.</p><h2>The Dictaphone in the Classroom</h2><p>None of the stories about businessmen using (or abusing) Dictaphones really surprised me. What did surprise me were the creative ways the Dictaphone was used as a pedagogical tool.</p><p>In 1924, for example, Dwight Everett Watkins at the University of California described in a paper how his students used a microphone, an amplifier, a telemegaphone (a type of speaker), and a Dictaphone to aid in public speaking. The setup helped students understand their rhetorical imperfections: bad grammar and bad sentence and paragraph structure. It also helped with elocution\u2014one of the early applications that Edison envisioned for his phonograph.</p><p>In 1933, George F. Meyer wrote about using the Dictaphone as an educational aid for blind and low-vision students in Minneapolis. Teachers recorded course material that would otherwise have had to be read aloud. And the students liked being able to listen to the material repeatedly without inconveniencing a human reader.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman seated to the left and typing on a typewriter, with a crowd of young women standing around her wearing headphones that connect to a machine at the typist\\u2019s side.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"568fe\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-seated-to-the-left-and-typing-on-a-typewriter-with-a-crowd-of-young-women-standing-around-her.jpg?id=62564721&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Students in 1930 listen to a Dictaphone recording, which the seated woman controls with foot pedals.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images</small></p><p>In 1938, Frances M. Freeman wrote her master\u2019s thesis on whether the Dictaphone could help typing students who were struggling to master the skill. Her study was supported by the Dictaphone Sales Corp., but unfortunately for the company, she concluded that using a Dictaphone offered no advantage in learning to type. She did find that the students in the Dictaphone group seemed more alert in class than students taught the traditional way.</p><p>That last finding was borne out in a 1964 experiment at Dunbar Elementary School in New Orleans, where the Dictaphone Corp. had outfitted an \u201celectronic classroom.\u201d The idea was to help reluctant students by fostering an environment where learning was fun. As Principal Beulah E. Brown related in an article about the experiment, she\u2019d first encountered a Dictaphone several years earlier while on sabbatical and immediately saw its pedagogical potential. The Dictaphone, Brown wrote, promised individually tailored educational experiences, allowing students to focus on specific challenges and freeing the teacher to have more personal interactions with each child. Testimonials from Warren Honore\u2019s fifth grade class attest to its success as an engaging technology.</p><h2>From the Dictaphone to Email to AI</h2><p>As a historian of technology, I loved learning that two heavyweights in the field, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/us/melvin-kranzberg-78-historian-of-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">Melvin Kranzberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Kuhn</a>, were both committed fans of the Dictaphone. I also enjoyed meditating on the role of the dictaphone and other technology as a mediator in the writing process.</p><p>My research turned up <a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/tolstoys-dictaphone\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Tolstoy\u2019s Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse</em></em></a> (Graywolf Press), a 1996 collection of essays edited by the literary critic <a href=\"https://agnionline.bu.edu/about/our-people/authors/sven-birkerts/\" target=\"_blank\">Sven Birkerts</a><em><em>. </em></em>The title comes from an anecdote about the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who refused the offer of a Dictaphone because it would be \u201ctoo dreadfully exciting\u201d and would distract him from his literary pursuits. To form the volume, Birkerts posed questions to his authors concerning the place of self and soul in a society being bombarded with new forms of communication\u2014namely, email and the internet.</p><p>Today, of course, our world is being shaped by AI, arguably an even bigger disrupter than email was in the 1990s or the Dictaphone was in the early 20th century.

The 15-year-old lives in Orlando, Fla., a state where flooding is frequent in part because of its low elevation.</p><p>The changing climate is increasing the risk. Warmer air holds more water, leading to heavier-than-usual rainfall and more flooding, according to the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Environmental Protection Agency</a>.</p><h3>Abigail Merchant</h3><br /><p><strong>School</strong> </p><p>Orlando Science Middle High Charter, in Florida</p><p><strong>Grade </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Sophomore</p><p><strong>Hobbies</strong> </p><p>Basketball and playing the drums</p><p>Currently <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-hacking-cybersecurity-nasa-visionspace\" target=\"_self\">satellites</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/radar-imaging-monitoring-climate-change\" target=\"_self\">synthetic aperture radar</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/gladys-west-hidden-figure-gps\" target=\"_self\">GPS</a> are used to collect data on flood damage, track the location of victims, and communicate with emergency responders. But technology failures and slow data transmission speeds lead to delays in response time, Merchant says. The increase in global flooding has intensified the need for more accurate and reliable methods.</p><p>Last year Merchant built what she says is a more effective way to track and collect data during floods: a small, inexpensive, standardized <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-small-satellites-are-providing-lowcost-access-to-space\" target=\"_self\">CubeSat</a> integrated with artificial intelligence. The <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/building-an-orbiting-internet-just-for-satellites\" target=\"_self\">little satellites use a multiple of 10- by 10- by 10-centimeter units</a>\u2014which allows manufacturers to develop their batteries, solar panels, computers, and other parts as off-the-shelf components.</p><p>The CubeSat takes images of an area and uses pattern recognition to detect flooding, assess infrastructure damage, and track survivors.</p><p>Merchant presented her paper on the device at this year\u2019s IEEE <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Region 3</a> annual conference, <a href=\"https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE SoutheastCon</a>.</p><p>\u201cIEEE is a foundational part of my growth as a young researcher,\u201d she says. \u201cIt turned engineering from my dream to reality.\u201d</p><h2>Building a CubeSat at MIT</h2><p>Merchant says her interest in disaster response was sparked after learning that it can take several hours for emergency workers to receive satellite data.</p><p>Determined to find a faster method, she began researching technologies and discovered what CubeSats can do.</p><p>\u201cCubeSats are very agile, scalable, and capable of forming constellations (multiple-satellite groups) that update data in nearly real time,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea that these small satellites\u2014which fit into the palm of your hand\u2014could deliver life-saving insights faster than traditional systems really inspired me to push the concept further.\u201d</p><p>Last year Merchant and three of her classmates were accepted into <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://bwsi.mit.edu/cubesat-challenge/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beaver Works Build a CubeSat Challenge</a>, where teams of up to five U.S. high school students were given eight months to develop a satellite capable of completing a space-based research mission.</p><p>Merchant\u2019s team\u2014the <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/webcast/beaverworks/s25/cubesat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Satellite Sentinels</a>\u2014built a CubeSat powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can identify heavily impacted flood zones and remotely collect data for disaster relief and environmental monitoring. CNNs analyze image data for pattern recognition.</p><p>Merchant was the group\u2019s payload programmer and led the mission\u2019s design and simulation efforts, which included planning, configuring hardware, and developing autonomous software and algorithms to manage the payload.</p><p>The team began by creating a 3D model of the device to visualize and refine the placement of its parts. The technology used\u2014including a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi</a>, multiple sensors, and a camera\u2014was housed in a clear plastic cube.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three 1U CubeSat units side by side.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7eb89\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-1u-cubesat-units-side-by-side.jpg?id=62645414&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The middle CubeSat was developed by Merchant and her team during the MIT Beaver Works Build a CubeSat Challenge. On the left is a commercial 1U CubeSat while on the right is a prototype of Merchant\u2019s current design. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Abigail Merchant</small></p><p>The device, which cost US $310 to build, weighs about 495 grams and was remotely connected to a laptop via <a href=\"https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/tech-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluetooth</a> during ground-based testing. The computer contains a machine learning algorithm\u2014written by Merchant using <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>\u2014that analyzes collected images to detect flooding.</p><p>The CubeSat takes a high-definition image of its surroundings every 2 minutes and transmits it to the laptop. The satellite transfers up to 1,500 images daily and stores them on a 16-gigabyte SD card.</p><p>The algorithm then analyzes patterns, including changes in the water\u2019s color and the image\u2019s pixel density. When the algorithm detects flooding, the device can alert emergency responders.</p><p>\u201cWhile many existing systems operate on multihour cycles, the CubeSat captures high-resolution images every 2 minutes,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cThe system can then trigger alerts that are delivered to first responders via SMS or email.\u201d</p><p>To test their system, Merchant and her team built a city model made of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwjL4_HW0cCRAxVrFq0GHXarIIMYACICCAEQDhoCcHY&amp;ae=2&amp;aspm=1&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgP_JBhD-ARIsANpEMxx_LTL2CYrt6MTNaTw8Uwg0GXh7c1ESvihyfeHZMrOlMY-05m2894waAtkUEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASZeRoZ0DibY4mwrXyIZ1uxKoD7jIr24jiM5BXPzI3uaV74Qppa7itfAyzOgipLKIx5Qre6poFdsa6658iv-4JqoGP5zQeasw2KoooZKxekagaKwFB4W4GxHUIEnPPoc4Xxq700XtH&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_35&amp;sig=AOD64_1PXiPwo6s4gyW40AvBebKK-dGkDw&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjiqOjW0cCRAxWMMDQIHdG9DwgQ0Qx6BAgPEAE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lego</a> blocks in an empty bathtub. They positioned the CubeSat over it, and it took images of the scene. They then added water and dirt to make it look more like a real flood. The CubeSat successfully transferred the images to the laptop, and the algorithm detected the flooding.</p><p>Out of 30 teams, the Satellite Sentinels placed third.</p><h2>Continuing her work at Accenture</h2><p>Merchant is continuing her research on flood-prevention technologies at <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a> in Richmond, Va., where she works remotely as a payload owner and designer for the company\u2019s CubeSat launch team.</p><p>After the MIT program ended, Merchant decided to scale her project. She reached out to her former mentor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hudson-space\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Hudson</a>, the global technical lead in space cybersecurity at Accenture. He offered her an internship.</p><p>Merchant is working to make the transition from prototype to functional product but, she says, needs to overcome obstacles she encountered with her MIT project.</p><p>The main one was that the model struggled to detect flooding in variable conditions. It\u2019s because the CNN model needs context, she says. Without it, the model can misinterpret complex visual cues. To fix the issue, Merchant trained the algorithm to spot flooding by identifying colors in individual pixels.</p><p>Transmitting images using Bluetooth worked in her bathroom, but it isn\u2019t quite as useful when CubeSats are orbiting 700 kilometers above the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve used a Bluetooth headset before, you know it disconnects the moment you walk away from the device it\u2019s connected to,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to work when the CubeSat constellation is in orbit.\u201d</p><p>She suggested the Accenture team switch to SubMiniature Version A (SMA) antennas. The RF antennas connect to the CubeSats using an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SMA connector</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe development process has been one of the most formative experiences of my career so far,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cWorking through the payload design and validation and meeting with these teams has given me so much experience, especially for my age.\u201d</p><p>Her payload is expected to be launched early next year.</p><h2>An aerospace internship at MIT</h2><p>Merchant is an intern at the MIT <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/node/2873\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school\u2019s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups.

It turned engineering from a dream to reality.\u201d</p><p>In that role, Merchant is focusing on cognitive cartography, a method for structuring complex information into semantic maps that reveal how ideas and concepts relate to one another. She uses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U1S0WSsPuE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embedding models</a>, a type of machine learning that converts information into numerical representations. The embeddings allow computers to recognize similarities and relationships between concepts, even when they are described in different ways. The approach helps an AI product understand how ideas connect, rather than treating each piece of data as isolated.</p><p>\u201cBeing one of the youngest people in the lab is daunting,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m really excited to learn from engineers and researchers who are working at the cutting edge of the field.\u201d</p><p>She says she is hoping to attend MIT or <a href=\"https://www.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford</a>.</p><h2>The future of IEEE</h2><p>Merchant was introduced to IEEE by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnjuisai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Jusai</a>, former finance chair of the <a href=\"https://ewh.ieee.org/r3/orlando/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Orlando Section</a>.</p><p>Her first personal experience with the organization happened in 2023 while she was conducting research for a science fair project. She was working on a robotic arm that could pick up items using an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/brain-waves-control-a-robot\" target=\"_self\">electroencephalogram</a> and Bluetooth. The project was inspired by her grandmother, who suffers from mobility issues and was wheelchair-bound.</p><p>\u201cI kept seeing IEEE mentioned in every regulation and standard I found,\u201d Merchant says. When she learned about an upcoming Orlando Section meeting, she asked her mother to take her.</p><p>At the meeting, several members presented their research. Merchant asked <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/masood-ejaz-48b49895\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Masood Ejaz</a> and <a href=\"https://ccie.ucf.edu/person/varadraj-gurupur/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Varadraj Gurupur</a>\u2014the chapter chair and cochair\u2014if she could discuss her science fair project.</p><p>\u201cAfter presenting my work, IEEE quickly became a community that has shaped my understanding of what engineering can accomplish,\u201d she says.</p><p>She felt on top of the world, she says, when she presented her paper about her CubeSat project at IEEE SouthEastCon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of those experiences that really changes you,\u201d she says.</p><p>She is excited to become an IEEE student member when she starts college, she says. She also has her sights set on being elected as its president someday.</p><p>\u201cI met <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-dec-2025\" target=\"_self\">Kathleen Kramer</a> at one of my local IEEE events before she was elected IEEE president, and we spoke about my work,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter she was elected, I realized that I would love to become the president of IEEE someday.</p><p>\u201cI hope one day that I can step into the same shoes as her and continue to help IEEE the same way it helped me.\u201d</p>"

Uber\u2019s well-funded Elevate initiative, which included<a href=\"https://evtol.news/__media/PDFs/UberElevateWhitePaperOct2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> a white paper</a> and three high-profile annual summits, effectively launched the electric vertical take-off and landing<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-aircraft\" target=\"_self\"> (eVTOL) industry</a>, promising investors, regulators, and the general public that these futuristic flying taxis were \u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JuWOUEFB_IQ\" target=\"_blank\">closer than you think</a>.\u201d</p><p>At the time, California-based<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Joby Aviation</a> was still in stealth mode. But behind the scenes, this pioneering eVTOL developer\u2014which has received more than US $3 billion in total funding, including<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/toyota-to-invest-500-million-in-joby-aviation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> around $900 million from Toyota</a>\u2014was playing a major role in shaping Uber\u2019s vision. It later stepped in to keep that vision alive,<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-aviation-welcomes-new-75m-investment-from-uber-as-it-acquires-uber-elevate-and-expands-partnership/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> acquiring the Elevate program</a> in 2020 after Uber CEO<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Khosrowshahi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Dara Khosrowshahi</a> decided to axe it.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"joby\">Now, Joby, which was founded in 2009 and has become the dominant eVTOL startup, says it is finally on the verge of making \u201curban air mobility\u201d a reality. It plans to conduct its first passenger flights in 2026 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>\u201cDubai continues to be our global launchpad for commercial service, and our progress here is a testament to the UAE\u2019s visionary approach to advanced air mobility,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/antokho/?originalSubdomain=ae\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Anthony Khoury</a>, Joby\u2019s UAE general manager, in an email interview. \u201cDubai is on track to be the first city in the world to offer a fully integrated, premium air taxi network, and we are sprinting toward that target.\u201d</p><h2>Joby Struck a Six-Year Exclusive Deal with Dubai</h2><p>The company first <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-to-launch-air-taxi-service-uae/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced its UAE plans</a> at the World Governments Summit in Dubai in February 2024, striking a deal with Dubai\u2019s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that gives it an exclusive right to operate air taxis there for six years from the launch of commercial operations.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Joby\u2019s exclusive Dubai deal will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis </span></p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"agreement\">Joby also signed an agreement with U.K.-based<a href=\"https://skyports.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> Skyports</a> to design, build, and operate four \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-2661135407\" target=\"_blank\">vertiport</a>\u201d sites in Dubai\u2014places for the eVTOL aircraft to load and unload passengers and charge their batteries. The first vertiport will be near Dubai International Airport, with additional ones planned for Dubai Mall, the Atlantis the Royal resort, and American University in Dubai.</p><p>Joby won\u2019t be the first eVTOL developer to carry passengers. That distinction goes to China\u2019s EHang, which is already conducting limited sightseeing and<a href=\"https://www.ehang.com/news/1275.html\" target=\"_blank\"> demonstration flights</a> with its two-seat, autonomous electric multicopters. (Joby\u2019s aircraft are piloted.) If Joby pulls off its goal, however, it will be the first to routinely fly passengers from point to point over urban traffic, in keeping with Uber Elevate\u2019s original vision. Its exclusive agreement in Dubai will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis, which includes a handful of other Western eVTOL developers, plus a growing number of Chinese players. Besides its Dubai deal, Joby also has a partnership with Delta to start an airport shuttle service in the United States.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A futuristic-looking electric rotorcraft is seen flying in a blue sky.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b31d3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-futuristic-looking-electric-rotorcraft-is-seen-flying-in-a-blue-sky.jpg?id=62599883&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Joby S4 electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft has six electric motors, each weighing 28 kilograms and capable of a peak output of 236 kilowatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joby Aviation</small></p><p>Operating a reliable air taxi service is a demanding proposition that will require Joby\u2019s aircraft, charging infrastructure, and scheduling software to perform safely and reliably day in and day out. Since every new and complex technology has teething problems, Joby envisions fairly limited initial operations in 2026.</p><p>\u201cWe will transition from test flights to more complex proving runs and eventually nonpaying passenger flights out of the completed vertiports, ensuring a seamless passenger experience ahead of full commercial launch,\u201d says Khoury. He adds that Joby is currently working with Skyports to ready its initial vertiports and with government agencies in Dubai and the UAE to receive the necessary approvals for its operations.</p><p>\u201cDubai\u2019s approach is deeper and more comprehensive than what you see in many of the headlines,\u201d said Clint Harper, an aviation infrastructure and policy advisor who recently participated in an advanced air mobility workshop with Dubai\u2019s RTA. \u201cIn our workshop,\u201d he says, \u201cthe RTA staff had fantastic questions and concerns regarding safety, security, and system-level integration. Everyone recognized and appreciated strong government support and wanted to deliver the right system solution, not just a one-off demo. I was thoroughly impressed and inspired.\u201d</p><h2>Initial Air Operations Will Precede an Airworthiness Certificate</h2><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"groundwork\">Notably, all of this groundwork is taking place in advance of Joby receiving an initial type certificate for its aircraft from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In the United States (and elsewhere), a type certificate is typically a prerequisite for conducting commercial operations with paying passengers. Joby claims it\u2019s making good progress toward FAA certification, but how quickly (or slowly) that process moves is largely out of its hands. In recent years, the FAA has been taking longer to certify even conventional airplanes and helicopters, which the industry blames on staffing shortages at the agency and more cautious decision-making in the wake of the<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/boeing-plea-737-max-crashes-b34daa014406657e720bec4a990dccf6\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing 737 Max crisis</a>.</p><p>This perception that certification delays have more to do with bureaucracy than safety may be why Dubai is willing to approve some early operations by Joby in advance of FAA type certification. Interestingly, the United States is now following the UAE\u2019s example. In September, the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation began soliciting proposals for an<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-new-plan-fast-track-advanced-air\" target=\"_blank\"> eVTOL Integration Pilot Program</a> (eIPP), which will select at least five projects to demonstrate eVTOL operations in the national airspace starting as early as summer 2026.</p><p>The FAA has<a href=\"https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-policy/trump-executive-order-drones-will-shape-us-evtol-roll-out/\" target=\"_blank\"> stated</a> that the eIPP won\u2019t allow eVTOL developers to bypass certification requirements or carry paying passengers. However, it will enable them to undertake additional testing and demonstration flights as a stepping-stone to commercial operations. Joby says it\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-plans-to-jumpstart-us-operations-through-eipp/\" target=\"_blank\"> planning to take part</a> in the eIPP, meaning its air taxis could also be flying over U.S. cities in 2026\u2014even if the only person on board is the pilot.</p>"

But following a string of reversals and environmental mishaps, the facilities began going into a decline in the 1990s and 2000s. At the same time, Chinese producers, which were much less confined by environmental regulations, <a href=\"https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-rare-earth-elements-dominance-in-global-supply-chains/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">began their astonishingly rapid ascendence</a>.</p><p>Today, China controls <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/china-s-share-in-rare-earth-magnet-production-2024\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">between about 85 and 99 percent</a> of the global market for key rare earth oxides and metals, on which huge and vital tech-based industries depend. The United States and its allies find themselves at China\u2019s mercy for certain rare earths, including ones that are essential for motors, semiconductors, electroluminescent compounds, optoelectronics, and catalysis. They\u2019re in critical components of countless military systems, such as ones in aircraft, submarines, weapons, and night-vision gear.</p><p>For these reasons, the resumption of mass production of rare earths at Mountain Pass, which was greatly <a href=\"https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scaled up during 2025</a>, was a major development in geopolitics.

This effort <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/canada-may-be-united-states-best-hope-minerals-security\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">started puzzlingly</a>, with some high-profile arm twisting of Ukraine, whose deposits are dismissed by mining experts. And also with overtures about annexing Greenland, a district of Denmark whose rare-earth deposits are enormous but, like Ukraine\u2019s, are not attractive from a mining standpoint. As the year wore on, the administration eventually settled on a strategy similar to that of the Biden administration, which emphasized investing in domestic production and working with allies, such as Australia, to strengthen and expand existing mining, refining, and magnet-making operations outside of the United States.</p><p>Mostly overlooked by the administration so far has been Canada (also one of Trump\u2019s annexation targets). Canada has some exceptionally large reserves of rare earth elements, and it operates one of only about four sizable rare-earth-oxide refining plants outside of Asia.

But rather than a single dominant standard that could power all variety of mesh networks, three separate but interoperable technologies are instead reaching maturity more or less simultaneously: <a href=\"https://www.threadgroup.org/Portals/0/Documents/Thread_1.4_Features_White_Paper_September_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Thread 1.4</a>, a mesh standard for low-power smart-home devices; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_7\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi 7</a> standard for high-bandwidth computing; and the smart-home protocol <a href=\"https://developers.home.google.com/matter/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Matter,</a> which acts as a translator, so devices on different mesh networks can talk to one another. Together, these three provide the beginnings of compatibility and interoperability that has eluded mesh proponents for so long.</p><p>However, this multistandard compromise may well only be a way station. \u201cI expect that one mesh technology will eat all the others eventually, possibly incorporating them,\u201d said <a href=\"https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/mlsichit/\" target=\"_blank\">Mihail Sichitiu</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://ece.ncsu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">electrical and computer engineering</a> at North Carolina State University, in Raleigh. \u201cMaybe not immediately, but eventually. Looking at how other things evolved, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p><h2>Does Thread 1.4 Solve Mesh?<br /></h2><p>A mesh network is different from a conventional wireless network created by a regular <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wi-fi-7-stomps-on-the-gas\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi router</a>. Every device in a mesh network can relay messages to every other device, like rugby players passing a ball. When you add more devices, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking\" target=\"_blank\">the mesh gets stronger</a>\u2014and if one device fails, the other devices self-configure a new mesh to work around the failure.</p><p>The story of mesh networks in 2026 begins with Thread 1.4. In 2014, a coalition led by Arm, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest\" target=\"_blank\">Nest Labs</a>, and Samsung launched the <a href=\"https://www.threadgroup.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Thread group</a> to promote a commercialized and ultimately <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2016/05/30/openthread-a-solution-to-the-wifi-of-things/\" target=\"_blank\">open-source</a> mesh standard. The coalition expanded from there, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/06/apple-the-thread-group/\" target=\"_blank\">soon welcoming Apple and Amazon</a> into the ranks.</p><p>But there was a catch. Each Thread network worked only with devices from the same brand. A Google mesh network would connect only with other Google devices. Same with Amazon, same with Apple. And this was a highly inconvenient stumbling block for mesh networking that held true up to and including <a href=\"https://www.threadgroup.org/Portals/0/documents/support/Thread1.3.0WhitePaper_07192022_3990_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Thread 1.3</a>, released in 2022.</p><p>However, starting on 1 January 2026, Thread 1.4 becomes the alliance\u2019s only certified standard. Using Thread 1.4, now the only supported version of Thread, all devices can join a single mesh, regardless of whether they\u2019re made by Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, or any other device maker in the Thread consortium.</p><p>Thread 1.4 addresses much of the smart-home mesh fragmentation problem by letting devices from different manufacturers securely join the same mesh network\u2014a capability called <a href=\"https://www.matteralpha.com/news/smartthings-hubs-upgrade-to-thread-1-4-with-credential-sharing-feature\" target=\"_blank\">credential sharing</a>.</p><p>Once these credentials are shared, devices from different ecosystems can finally work together on one mesh network.

However, fewer commercial interests during the proto-internet years meant a quicker and simpler route to the eventual <a href=\"https://tcpip.training/history-of-tcp-ip/\" target=\"_blank\">TCP/IP consensus</a>. Today, by contrast, all the big players want a stake in mesh, and all have prioritized different problems and solutions.</p><p>There\u2019s a second reason, says <a href=\"https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/myung-lee\" target=\"_blank\">Myung Lee</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/eleceng\" target=\"_blank\">electrical and computer engineering</a> at the City College of New York. \u201cThe need for global interoperability drove the TCP/IP empire, but mesh networks largely occupy the edge,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIn the edge, the requirements are diverse.\u201d</p><p>That diversity became clear to Lee over a decade of chairing IEEE standards groups on short-range wireless communications. No single standard could optimize for both ultralow power and high speed, so the IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ieee802.org/15/\" target=\"_blank\">802.15 working group</a> developed separate tracks for different use cases\u2014some for devices that needed to last years on a battery, others for devices that needed to move data fast. That patchwork of specialized standards has shaped the smart-home landscape ever since.</p><p>One kind of mesh, Lee says, they developed for high-speed data transfers between devices that demand more power\u2014think laptops, smartphones, and plugged-in smart-home hubs. The other they tailored for slow, occasional data exchanges involving only tiny power budgets\u2014devices such as door sensors, leak detectors, and environmental monitors that might need to last months or years between charges.</p><p>\u201cThat split alone illustrates why a single mesh standard is difficult,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBecause edge applications simply do not share a common set of constraints.\u201d</p><p>Something similar is happening in 2026. Thread is now poised to handle smart-home devices and always-on sensors. But homes also need ultrafast Wi-Fi for laptops and phones and streaming video. That\u2019s where Wi-Fi 7 mesh comes in. And because these two mesh networks speak entirely different languages, a Matter translation layer is still needed between the two. Both <a href=\"https://www.delloro.com/news/wi-fi-7-to-drive-double-digit-enterprise-wlan-growth-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi 7</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)#Versions\" target=\"_blank\">Matter</a> (in their most stable and interoperable versions) arrived en masse in products hitting store shelves in 2025. This is the year they\u2019re all finally ready to work together.</p><p>So mesh success, in 2026, looks less like victory and more like invisibility.</p><p>Consider a user opening up an app on their phone, and over their Wi-Fi mesh connection, tapping a button to unlock a smart door lock inside their home using Thread. If this sequence just works, with no setup headaches or incompatibility warnings, without the user ever needing to know whether Wi-Fi 7 or Thread 1.4 ultimately relayed the message that unlocked the door, then the convergence was successful.</p><p>The technologies themselves haven\u2019t transitioned into a single, unified mesh standard. But they will have at least stopped getting in each other\u2019s way. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

They can view with the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects as faint smudges that don\u2019t even begin to capture their majesty, or they can capture long-exposure images with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electronically-assisted-astronomy\" target=\"_blank\">astrocameras</a> and display the results on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing experience.</p><p>Stand-alone telescope eyepieces with active light amplification do exist for a real-time viewing, but commercial products are pricey, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars. I wanted something I could use for the public-astronomy observation nights that I organize in my community. So I decided to build a low-cost DIY amplifying eyepiece, to make it easier for visitors to observe deep-sky objects but without requiring a large financial investment on my part.</p><p>I quickly realized there was already an industry replete with hardware for handling low-light conditions\u2014the security-camera industry. Faced with the challenge of monitoring areas with a variety of lighting, often using cameras spread out over a large facility, makers of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras created a video standard that uses digital sensors to capture images but then transmits them as HD-resolution analog signals over coaxial cables. By using this <a href=\"https://www.teracomsolutions.com.au/FAQ/ahd_explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Analog High Definition (AHD) transmission standard</a>, you can attach new cameras to preexisting long cable runs and still get a high-quality image. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Primary components for the amplifying eyepiece.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c19df\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/primary-components-for-the-amplifying-eyepiece.jpg?id=62609418&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A CMOS-image sensor module from a security camera [top left], a USB capture card [bottom left], and an OLED viewfinder [right] process analog video data.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>While I didn\u2019t need the long-distance capability of these cameras, I was very interested in their low price and ability to handle dim conditions. The business end of these cameras is a module that integrates a <a href=\"https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2017/cg_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">CMOS image sensor</a> with supporting electronics. After some research, I settled on <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805192137246.html?gatewayAdapt=fra2usa4itemAdapt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a module</a> that combined a 2-megapixel <a href=\"https://www.sony-semicon.com/files/62/flyer_security/IMX307LQD_LQR_Flyer.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sony IMX307</a> sensor with a supporting <a href=\"https://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/SPEC/661/K1196433661.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NVP2441 chipset</a>.</p><p>The key factor was choosing a sensor-chipset combination that supports something called Starlight or<a href=\"https://www.cctvcore.com/blog/Slow-Shutter-Speed-Techincal-Article\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Sens-Up</a> mode. This makes the camera more sensitive to light than the human eye, albeit at the cost of a little speed. Images are created by integrating approximately 1.2 seconds of exposure time on the sensor. That might make for choppy security footage, but it\u2019s not noticeable when making observations of nebulae and other astronomical objects (unless of course something <em><em>really</em></em> weird happens in the sky!)</p><h2>From Astronomy To Security Cameras and Back Again</h2><p>The existence of the Sens-up mode is actually part of the technical heritage of digital imaging sensors. CMOS sensors were<a href=\"https://ericfossum.com/Presentations/1993%20Feb%20Active%20Pixel%20Sensors%20Are%20CCDs%20Dinosaurs%20SPIE%20Feb%2093.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> developed as a successor</a> to charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which were eagerly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device#Use_in_astronomy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embraced by the astronomical community</a> following their introduction in 1970, replacing long-exposure photographic plates. However, the ability to take exposure frames as long as one second is rarely something that CCTV cameras are designed for: It can be more of a drawback than a feature, leading to blurred images of moving objects or people.</p><p>As a result, this capability is rarely mentioned in the product descriptions, and so finding the right module was the most challenging part: I had to buy three different camera modules before finally landing on one that worked.</p><p>The output from the camera module is passed to a <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808460958932.html?gatewayAdapt=fra2usa4itemAdapt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">digital viewfinder</a>, which displays both the video and control menus generated by the module. These menus are navigated using a four-way, press-to-select joystick that connects to a dedicated header on the module.</p><p>The output of the camera is also passed to a <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805840413018.html?gatewayAdapt=fra2usa4itemAdapt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">capture card</a> that converts the analog signal to digital and provides a USB-C interface, which allows images to be seen and saved using a smartphone. All the electronics can be powered via battery for complete stand-alone operation or from a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-intel-piix3-usb-interface\" target=\"_blank\">USB</a> cable attached to the capture card.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Diagram showing connections between CMOS sensor, joystick, OLED, analog HD, viewfinder, USB.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8ddb1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-showing-connections-between-cmos-sensor-joystick-oled-analog-hd-viewfinder-usb.jpg?id=62609449&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The analog HD module can be controlled directly using a joystick to navigate onscreen menus. Power can be provided externally via USB-C connector on the capture card or via an optional battery pack.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>The components fit in an enclosure I made from 3D-printed parts, designed to match the 32-millimeter diameter of most telescope eyepieces for easy mounting. The whole thing cost less than US $250. </p><h2>Testing out the Amplifying Eyepiece</h2><p>I took my new amplifying eyepiece out with my <a href=\"https://www.celestron.com/products/c11-optical-tube-assembly-cge-dovetail?srsltid=AfmBOor1i9qRc7qTRPKMtlerPIaX7zOkiJDj7rkUGlagXo0c1ngKwrGx\" target=\"_blank\">Celestron C11</a> telescope to give it a try. Soon I had in my viewfinder the Dumbbell Nebula, also known as Messier 27/M27, which is normally quite hard to see. It was significantly brighter compared to a naked-eye observation. Certainly the difference wasn\u2019t as marked as with a commercial rig that has noise-reducing cooling for the sensor electronics. But it was still an enormous improvement and for a fraction of the cost.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A photograph of a cloudy purple and white deep-sky object.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8eaec\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photograph-of-a-cloudy-purple-and-white-deep-sky-object.jpg?id=62609420&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Orion Nebula, some 1,340 light years away.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jordan Blanchard</small></p><p>The amplifier is also more versatile: You can remove it from the telescope, and with a 2.8-mm HD lens fitted to the camera-module sensor, you can use it as a night-vision camera. That\u2019s handy when trying to operate in dark outdoor conditions on starry nights!</p>For the future, I\u2019d like to upgrade the USB-C capture module to one that can handle the sensor\u2019s digital output directly, rather than just the analog signal. This would give a noticeable boost in resolution when recording or streaming to a phone or computer. Beyond that, I\u2019m interested in finding another low-cost camera module with a longer exposure, and refining the 3D-printed housing so it\u2019s easier to build and adapt to other observing setups. That way the eyepiece will stay affordable, but people can still push it toward more serious electronically assisted astronomy."

But as I prepare for this year\u2019s event, here are some of the devices that have already caught my eye. </p><h2>Headphones that can read your brainwaves</h2><p>Electroencephalography, or EEG, has been used in health care for decades to monitor neural activity. It usually involves a person wearing a whole helmet of electrodes, but scaled-down versions of the tech are now being integrated into consumer devices and may soon be ready for users. </p><p>Several neurotech companies using EEG will be at CES this year. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.neurable.com/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neurable</a> (a company we\u2019ve had <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/brainy-startup-neurable-unveils-the-worlds-first-braincontrolled-vr-game\" target=\"_self\">on our radar for years</a>) is announcing a new headset with gaming brand HyperX, which is meant to help players hone their focus by tracking brain activity in real time. Neurable\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.neurable.com/products/mw75neurolt?variant=48878808236278\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">over-ear EEG headphones</a> for everyday use are now available for preorder.  <a href=\"https://www.naox.tech/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Naox</a> will also bring its in-ear EEG tech to consumer-oriented earbuds. And <a href=\"https://elemindtech.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elemind</a>, another <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/elemind-neuromodulation\" target=\"_self\">company we\u2019ve covered</a>, aims to help you sleep with its headband. With wearables already monitoring vital signs, sleep, and activity, 2026 may be the year our brainwaves join the list of biosignals we can track on a daily basis. </p><h2><span>A toothbrush to sniff out health issues</span></h2><div><span>Sonic toothbrush company <a href=\"https://y-brush.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Y-Brush</a> is <a href=\"https://y-brush.co/pages/ces-announcement-ybrush-halo\" target=\"_blank\">introducing dental tech</a> analyzing another biomarker: smelly breath. The toothbrush itself is y-shaped and looks almost like a dental retainer on a stick, with bristles surrounding the teeth. In the latest version, the Y-Brush Halo, a gas sensor called SmartNose is integrated to analyze breath biomarkers. The company says this allows the toothbrush to detect more than 300 health conditions, including early-stage diabetes and liver disorders. </span></div><h2><span></span>Automatic massage roller to sooth sore muscles</h2><p><a href=\"https://rheofit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RheoFit</a>\u2019s A1 massage roller basically looks like what would happen if a foam roller and a massage chair had a baby. The device automatically rolls itself down your spine and offers two replaceable surfaces: one harder material that mimics a masseuse\u2019s knuckles, and a gentler option that\u2019s meant to feel more like an open palm. </p><p><span>This will be the second year the RheoFit A1 is on display. To find out whether it\u2019s worth the US $449 price tag, I\u2019ll have to try it out on site. </span></p><h2>Minimalist e-ink smartphone to cut out distractions</h2><p>Just before last year\u2019s CES, several devices were <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/calm-tech\" target=\"_blank\">awarded a new certification</a> meant to reward tech designed to be less distracting. While most exhibitors will keep competing for our attention, a few are tapping into a desire for calm and clarity. </p><p>Minimalist tech company <a href=\"https://mudita.com/products/phones/\" target=\"_blank\">Mudita</a>, for instance, will be showing its e-ink smartphone, which began shipping in 2025. The phone is designed to reduce screen time with its black-and-white, paperlike display, and the operating system is designed to run without Google. Like other not-as-smart phones (such as the Wisephone or Light Phone), the Mudita Kompakt offers the essentials\u2014messaging, maps, camera, and so forth\u2014without constant notifications. </p><h2>Food allergen detector to avoid anaphylaxis</h2><p>Some new tech surprises users with an experience they didn\u2019t know they wanted. Others aim to offer the solutions you\u2019ve dreamt about. For me, French startup <a href=\"https://www.allergen-alert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Allergen Alert</a> falls into the second category. </p><p>The startup, one of the listed exhibitors at an early press event on 4 January, is developing a portable system to test food allergens in real time. I\u2019ve been eating gluten-free for most of my life (not by choice), and I know how easily allergens can sneak into a dish with just a sprinkle of flour, or a dash of soy sauce\u2014especially when you\u2019re traveling or eating out. For many people with severe allergies, a device like this could be a lifesaver. </p><p><em>This story was updated on 5 January, 2026 to add that Neurable announced a new headset with HyperX. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the company was displaying its MW75 Neuro at CES. This has been removed.</em><br /></p>"
