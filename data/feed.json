        "summary": "We study the medium and long term impacts of Skills for Effective Entrepreneurship Development (SEED), a 3-week entrepreneurship training program for secondary school students in Uganda. The mini-MBA, modeled after business school curricula, was implemented as a randomized field experiment with a nationally representative sample of 4,402 youth. After four years, the training improved both hard and soft skills. SEED graduates became more effective negotiators and communicators and exhibited improved self-efficacy, stability, plasticity, and stress management. In the medium run, treated youth were more likely to start enterprises and more successful in ensuring their survival, thereby gaining greater entrepreneurial experience. Their ventures were also of higher quality: more likely to be formal, have employees, be in collaboration with other entrepreneurs, and use effective business management practices. With 52% of the sample still enrolled in post-secondary education, we find suggestive evidence that businesses led by the treatment groups performed better. After nine years, business ownership converged between treatment and control groups as control ownership rates doubled. However, SEED graduates maintained their edge in terms of business quality and operated firms with 20% higher revenues and 16% higher profits, without corresponding increases in capital or labor inputs, consistent with higher total factor productivity. Entrepreneurial success was achieved through the adoption of better business practices and experimentation, with soft skills related to entrepreneurial mindset playing a complementary role. SEED generated high returns on investment: the present discounted values of SEED-induced business and total earnings equal 20 and 27 times program costs, respectively."

        "summary": "We construct an international panel data set comprising three distinct yet plausible measures of government indebtedness: the debt-to-GDP, the interest-to-GDP, and the debt-to-equity ratios. Our analysis reveals that these measures yield differing conclusions about recent trends in government indebtedness. While the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached historically high levels, the other two indicators show either no clear trend or a declining pattern over recent decades. We argue for the development of stronger theoretical foundations for the measures employed in the literature, suggesting that, without such grounding, assertions about debt (un)sustainability may be premature."

        "summary": "Many temporary foreign worker programs issue \u201cclosed\u201d visas that effectively tie workers to a single employer, restricting worker mobility and weakening bargaining power. We study the labor market return to temporary foreign workers (TFWs) gaining permanent residency (PR), which loosens this mobility restriction. Using administrative data linking matched employer-employee data in Canada to temporary and permanent visa records from 2004\u20132014 along with an event-study design, we find that gaining PR leads to a sharp, immediate, and persistent increase in the job switching rate of 21.7 percentage points and an increase in earnings of 5.7 percent three years after PR. Workers also sort into high-wage firms after gaining PR, and the increase in the firm pay premium is roughly 56 percent of the total earnings gain. We find larger earnings gains for job switchers across industries, low-skilled workers, and workers from low-income countries. To guide and interpret our reduced-form results, we develop a search-and-matching model featuring heterogeneous workers and firms. Permanent residents and native-born workers search for jobs in the same labor market and engage in on-the-job search, while TFWs search separately within a segmented labor market and do not receive outside wage offers. We calibrate the model to match our reduced-form results, and we use it to simulate the long-run effects of PR and consider two counterfactual policies: (1) increasing the cost to firms of posting a TFW vacancy and (2) allowing TFWs to switch employers freely under \u201copen\u201d visas. We evaluate how these policies affect output, wages, profits, and overall social welfare."

        "summary": "This paper introduces an endogenous network of payment chains into a business cycle model. Motivated by evidence of linked payments across firms in Costa Rica, we develop a framework where production orders form bilateral relations: some payments are executed immediately, while others---chained payments---are delayed until upstream payments are received. These chains capture real-world situations in which firms must wait to be paid before paying their own suppliers, leaving resources temporarily idle even when demand and capacity exist. In equilibrium, agents choose the amount of chained payments given interest rates and access to internal funds or credit lines. This choice determines the payment-chain network and aggregate total-factor productivity (TFP). The paper characterizes equilibrium dynamics and pecuniary externalities when agents internalize their own payment delays but not the delays imposed on others."

        "summary": "We construct a new dataset of FOMC meeting transcripts from 1966 to 1990 to analyze the sources of heterogeneity in individual monetary policy preferences and study how this heterogeneity shapes policy decisions. Using these detailed discussions, we manually quantify and characterize each FOMC participants\u2019 preferred policies along with their reasoning and justification. We show that participants' beliefs about the effects of monetary policy\u2014specifically, their perceived slope of the Phillips Curve\u2014play a central role. Participants who believe monetary policy has stronger effects on real activity are more likely to cite output as a justification for easing, while those perceiving stronger price effects emphasize inflation as a reason for tightening. We then show that the Chair plays a unique and powerful role in reconciling these views, not just in setting policy rates, but also in minimizing dissent. The latter occurs because dissenters find their ability to influence policy in subsequent meetings is significantly curtailed."

That decision may ultimately increase pressure on global businesses to reduce their contributions to climate change.</p><h2>Multinationals put pressure on supply chains</h2><p>Multinational companies\u2019 efforts to reduce their climate impact puts pressure on their suppliers \u2013 meaning many more companies must take their climate impact into consideration.</p><p>For instance, U.S.-based Walmart operates over 10,000 stores across <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/about/location-facts\">19 countries</a> and is the largest single buyer of goods in the world. That means it faces a wide range of regulations, including tracking and reducing emissions from its suppliers. In 2017, it launched Project Gigaton, aiming to cut 1 gigaton of supply-chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Suppliers including Nestle, Unilever, Coca Cola, Samsung and Hanes helped the company <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/02/21/walmart-suppliers-lead-the-charge-help-deliver-project-gigaton-goal-more-than-six-years-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reach its target six years early</a> through practical measures such as boosting energy efficiency, redesigning packaging, and reducing food waste. <span>While the data is verified through internal quality controls co-developed with NGOs like the Environmental Defense Fund, analysts at </span><span><a href=\"https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CTA100-Walmart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Planet Tracker</a></span> note that these \u201cavoided\u201d emissions haven\u2019t yet stopped Walmart\u2019s absolute footprint from rising alongside its business growth.</p><p><span>In early 2025, this growth led Walmart to </span><span><a href=\"https://trellis.net/article/walmart-2025-esg-update/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>push back its interim deadlines</span></a></span> for two of its most ambitious emissions reduction targets.

Moreover<span>, </span>almost half of its electricity worldwide came from renewable energy in 2024, its emissions per unit of revenue fell, and it is still targeting zero emissions from its operations by 2040.</p><h2>There are profits to be made in clean tech</h2><p>In addition to facing pressure from buyers and governments, companies see profits to be made from investing in climate-friendly clean technology.</p><p>Since 2016, investments in clean energy have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/energy-environment/trump-renewable-energy-batteries.html\">outpaced that of fossil fuels</a> globally. This trend has only hastened, with nearly twice as much invested in clean energy as fossil fuels in 2025.</p><p></p><p>Lately, myriad <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00743-7\">new business opportunities</a> for multinational companies and start-ups alike have focused on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/amazon-sustainability-officers-ai-tool-climate-change/\">meeting AI\u2019s energy demand</a> through clean energy.</p><p>From 2014 to 2024, the climate tech sector yielded total <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/q1-2025/\">returns of nearly 200 percent</a> , and U.S. investment in climate tech was <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">still growing in 2025</a>.</p><p>In the first half of 2025, <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">close to one-fifth</a> of the over 1,600 venture deals in climate tech were made by corporations for strategic reasons, such as technology access, supply chain integration, or future product offerings. <span>Corporate strategic deals continued to represent about </span><a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NZI_2025-State-of-Climate-Tech-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>20 to 23 percent</span></a> of all climate tech equity transactions through the third and fourth quarters of 2025.</p><p><span>However, this surge in investment is more than a search for profit; it is a defensive necessity as the tech industry\u2019s growth begins to collide with its environmental limits.</span></p><h2>The AI energy paradox</h2><p><span>The rapid expansion of AI is forcing multinational companies to make explicit choices about their climate priorities. While tech leaders once relied on annual renewable credits to meet climate targets, the scale of the AI power boom is forcing more rigorous carbon accounting. Global data centers are </span><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai\" target=\"_blank\"><span>projected</span></a> to consume more electricity than Japan by 2030, a shift that turns \u201cvoluntary\u201d climate investments into a core business requirement for securing 24/7 energy supplies.</p><p><span>In 2025, the tech giants\u2019 own reports revealed the scale of AI emissions. Microsoft\u2019s 2025 Environmental Sustainability Report revealed a 23.4 percent </span><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/29/environmental-sustainability-report/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>increase</span></a> in total emissions since its 2020 baseline. Similarly, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2025-environmental-report/\">emissions have climbed 51 percent since 2019</a>, with a 22 percent surge in Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions in 2024 alone. <span>Amazon\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2024-report\" target=\"_blank\"><span>2024 Sustainability Report</span></a> noted a 33 percent jump since 2019 driven by the construction of new data centers. Meta\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2025-sustainability-report/\">supplier\u2019s emissions (99 percent of its total footprint) are being driven to new heights</a> by the \u201cembodied carbon\u201d of AI hardware.</p><p><span>While high costs might tempt some to cut corners, climate action could instead become a hedge against energy volatility. C</span>ompanies like Amazon and Google are securing reliable supply by leveraging <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\">federal fast-tracking of nuclear permits</a> to act as primary offtakers for the first generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). <span>This shift is accelerated by new federal orders to bypass nuclear licensing hurdles, as seen in Google\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/google-and-kairos-power-team-up-for-smr-deployments-in-us-first\" target=\"_blank\"><span>landmark agreement with Kairos Power</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/amazon-invests-in-x-energy-unveils-smr-project-plans\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Amazon\u2019s $500 million investment in X-energy</span></a><span>\u2014deals designed to secure the 24/7 \u201cbaseload\u201d power AI requires without abandoning carbon-free commitments.

Oil and gas companies, for example, <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/oil-and-gas-investment-is-more-important-than-ever\">continue to invest</a> in new oil and gas development. However, they also forecast <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/all-energy-types-are-needed\">renewable energy growth accelerating</a> and are investing in clean tech.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6016/chapter/5709986/Consumer-Facing-and-Carbon-Intensive-Sectors-A\">corporate leaders I interviewed</a>, from tech companies like Intel to sporting goods and apparel companies like Adidas, talked about aligning sustainability efforts and initiatives across their business globally whenever possible. This proactive approach allows them to more seamlessly collect data and respond to pressures arising domestically and globally, minimizing the need for costly patchwork efforts later. Moreover, global businesses know they will continue to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/feliciajackson/2025/11/07/international-standards-could-turn-net-zero-into-common-practice/\">face demands</a> from their customers, investors and employees to be better stewards of the planet.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges</p><p><span>In a 2025 Getty Images </span><a href=\"http://reports.gettyimages.com/VisualGPS-Visualizing-Sustainability-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>survey</span></a> of over 5,000 consumers across 25 countries, more than 80 percent of respondents reported that they expect clear ESG guidelines from businesses.

The divergence between federal deregulation in Washington and the rigid physical demands of the AI revolution has created a new era of corporate pragmatism. While some firms may use political shifts to \u201cgreenhush\u201d or delay abstract pledges, the world\u2019s largest corporations are finding that they cannot simply account away the massive energy and infrastructure requirements of the AI Age. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges. In this new landscape, the global businesses that thrive will be those that build carbon-free foundations, while responding to existing and future laws across the globe.</span></p><p><em>This article is adapted by the author from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

For elderly or disabled drivers, those bulky cords can <a href=\"https://www.ridc.org.uk/transport/inaccessible-charging-barrier-electric-disabled-and-older-drivers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">be a physical challenge.</a></p><p>As it was for smartphones years ago, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-charging\" target=\"_self\">wireless EV charging</a> has been the dream. But there\u2019s a difference of nearly four orders of magnitude between the roughly 14 watt-hours of a typical smartphone battery and that of a large EV. That\u2019s what makes the wireless charging on the 108-kilowatt-hour pack in the forthcoming Porsche Cayenne Electric so notable.</p><p>To offer the first inductive charger on a production car, Porsche had to overcome both technical and practical challenges\u2014such as how to protect a beloved housecat prowling below your car. The German automaker demonstrated the system at September\u2019s <a href=\"https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2025/products/porsche-demonstrates-inductive-charging-at-iaa.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IAA Mobility</a> show in Munich.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>With its <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a65810736/2026-porsche-cayenne-electric-prototype-drive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-volt architecture</a>, the Cayenne Electric can charge at up to 400 kW at a public DC station, enough to fill its pack from 10 to 80 percent in about 16 minutes. The wireless system delivers about 11 kW for Level 2 charging at home, where Porsche says three out of four of its customers do nearly all their fill-ups. Pull the Cayenne into a garage and align it over a floor-mounted plate, and the SUV will charge from 10 to 80 percent in about 7.5 hours. No plugs, tangled cords, or dirty hands. Porsche will offer a single-phase, 48-ampere version for the United States after buyers see their first Cayennes in mid-2026, and a <a href=\"https://cc-techgroup.com/single-phase-vs-three-phase-power/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">three-phase</a>, 16-A system in Europe.</p><h2>Porsche\u2019s Wireless Charging is Based on an Old Concept</h2><p>The concept of inductive charging has been around for more than a century. Two coils of copper wire are positioned near one another. A current flowing through one coil creates a magnetic field, which induces voltage in the second coil.</p><p>In the Porsche system, the floor-mounted pad, 78 centimeters wide, plugs into the home\u2019s electrical panel. Inside the pad, which weighs 50 kilograms, grid electricity (at 60 hertz in the United States, 50 Hz in most of the rest of the world) is converted to DC and then to high-frequency AC at 2,000 V.The resulting <a href=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1493137\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">85-kilohertz</a> magnetic field extends from the pad to the Cayenne, where it is converted again to DC voltage.</p><p>The waterproof pad can also be placed outdoors, and the company says it\u2019s unaffected by leaves, snow, and the like. In fact, the air-cooled pad can get warm enough to melt any snow, reaching temperatures as high as 50 \u00b0C.</p><p>The Cayenne\u2019s onboard charging hardware mounts between its front electric motor and battery. The 15-kg induction unit wires directly into the battery.</p><p>In most EVs, plug-in (conductive) AC charging tops out at <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36062942/evs-explained-charging-losses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">around 95 percent</a> efficiency. Porsche says its wireless system delivers 90 percent efficiency, despite an air gap of roughly 12 to 18 cm between the pad and vehicle.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory transferred an impressive <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kilowatts</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency.</span></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re super proud that we\u2019re just below conductive AC in charging efficiency,\u201d says Simon Schulze, Porsche\u2019s product manager for charging hardware. Porsche also beats inductive phone chargers, which typically max out at about 70 percent efficiency, Schulze says.</p><p>When the car gets within 7.5 meters of the charging pad, the Cayenne\u2019s screen-based parking-assist system turns on automatically. Then comes a kind of video game that requires the driver to align a pair of green circles on-screen, one representing the car, the other the pad. It\u2019s like a digital version of the tennis ball some people hang in their garage to gauge parking distance. There\u2019s ample wiggle room, with tolerances of 20 cm left to right, and 15 cm fore and aft. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss it,\u201d according to Schulze.</p><p>Induction loops detect any objects between the charging plate and the vehicle; such objects, if they\u2019re metal, could heat up dangerously. Radar sensors detect any living things near the pad, and will halt the charging if necessary. People can walk near the car or hop aboard without affecting a charging session.</p><p>Christian Holler, Porsche\u2019s head of charging systems, says the system conforms to International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection standards for electromagnetic radiation. The field remains below 15 microteslas, so it\u2019s safe for <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/devices-that-may-interfere-with-icds-and-pacemakers\" target=\"_blank\">people with pacemakers</a>, Porsche insists. And the aforementioned cat wouldn\u2019t be harmed even if it strayed into the magnetic field, though \u201cits metal collar might get warm,\u201d Schulze says.</p><p>The Porsche system\u2019s 90 percent efficiency is impressive but not record-setting. Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) transferred <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kW</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency, boosting its state of charge by 50 percent in 10 minutes. That <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-ev-charging-2668791896\" target=\"_self\">world-record wireless rate</a> relied on polyphase windings for coils, part of a U.S. Department of Energy project that was backed by Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company.</p><p>That effort, Holler says, spawned a Ph.D. paper from VW engineer <a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/9126/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Foote</a>. Yet the project had different goals from the one that led to the Cayenne charging system. ORNL was focused on maximum power transfer, regardless of cost, production feasibility, or reliability, he says.</p><p>By contrast, designing a system for showroom cars \u201crequires a completely different level of quality and processes,\u201d Holler says.</p><h2>High Cost Could Limit Adoption</h2><p> Cayenne buyers in Europe will pay around \u20ac7,000 (roughly US $8,100) for the optional charger. Porsche has yet to price it for the United States.</p><p> Loren McDonald, chief executive of Chargeonomics, an EV-charging analysis firm, said wireless charging \u201cis clearly the future,\u201d with use cases such as driverless robotaxis, curbside charging, or at any site \u201cwhere charging cables might be an annoyance or even a safety issue.\u201d</p><p>But for now, inductive charging\u2019s costly, low-volume status will limit it to niche models and high-income adopters, McDonald says. Public adoption will be critical \u201cso that drivers can convenience-charge throughout their driving day\u2014which then increases the benefits of spending more money on the system.\u201d</p><p>Porsche acknowledges that issue; the system conforms to wireless standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers so that other automakers might help popularize the technology.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want this to be proprietary, a Porsche-only solution,\u201d Schulze says. \u201cWe only benefit if other brands use it.\u201d</p>"

But technology failures and slow data transmission speeds lead to delays in response time, Merchant says. The increase in global flooding has intensified the need for more accurate and reliable methods.</p><p>Last year Merchant built what she says is a more effective way to track and collect data during floods: a small, inexpensive, standardized <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-small-satellites-are-providing-lowcost-access-to-space\" target=\"_self\">CubeSat</a> integrated with artificial intelligence.

The computer contains a machine learning algorithm\u2014written by Merchant using <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>\u2014that analyzes collected images to detect flooding.</p><p>The CubeSat takes a high-definition image of its surroundings every 2 minutes and transmits it to the laptop. The satellite transfers up to 1,500 images daily and stores them on a 16-gigabyte SD card.</p><p>The algorithm then analyzes patterns, including changes in the water\u2019s color and the image\u2019s pixel density. When the algorithm detects flooding, the device can alert emergency responders.</p><p>\u201cWhile many existing systems operate on multihour cycles, the CubeSat captures high-resolution images every 2 minutes,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cThe system can then trigger alerts that are delivered to first responders via SMS or email.\u201d</p><p>To test their system, Merchant and her team built a city model made of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwjL4_HW0cCRAxVrFq0GHXarIIMYACICCAEQDhoCcHY&amp;ae=2&amp;aspm=1&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgP_JBhD-ARIsANpEMxx_LTL2CYrt6MTNaTw8Uwg0GXh7c1ESvihyfeHZMrOlMY-05m2894waAtkUEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASZeRoZ0DibY4mwrXyIZ1uxKoD7jIr24jiM5BXPzI3uaV74Qppa7itfAyzOgipLKIx5Qre6poFdsa6658iv-4JqoGP5zQeasw2KoooZKxekagaKwFB4W4GxHUIEnPPoc4Xxq700XtH&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_35&amp;sig=AOD64_1PXiPwo6s4gyW40AvBebKK-dGkDw&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjiqOjW0cCRAxWMMDQIHdG9DwgQ0Qx6BAgPEAE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lego</a> blocks in an empty bathtub. They positioned the CubeSat over it, and it took images of the scene. They then added water and dirt to make it look more like a real flood. The CubeSat successfully transferred the images to the laptop, and the algorithm detected the flooding.</p><p>Out of 30 teams, the Satellite Sentinels placed third.</p><h2>Continuing her work at Accenture</h2><p>Merchant is continuing her research on flood-prevention technologies at <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a> in Richmond, Va., where she works remotely as a payload owner and designer for the company\u2019s CubeSat launch team.</p><p>After the MIT program ended, Merchant decided to scale her project. She reached out to her former mentor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hudson-space\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Hudson</a>, the global technical lead in space cybersecurity at Accenture. He offered her an internship.</p><p>Merchant is working to make the transition from prototype to functional product but, she says, needs to overcome obstacles she encountered with her MIT project.</p><p>The main one was that the model struggled to detect flooding in variable conditions. It\u2019s because the CNN model needs context, she says. Without it, the model can misinterpret complex visual cues. To fix the issue, Merchant trained the algorithm to spot flooding by identifying colors in individual pixels.</p><p>Transmitting images using Bluetooth worked in her bathroom, but it isn\u2019t quite as useful when CubeSats are orbiting 700 kilometers above the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve used a Bluetooth headset before, you know it disconnects the moment you walk away from the device it\u2019s connected to,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to work when the CubeSat constellation is in orbit.\u201d</p><p>She suggested the Accenture team switch to SubMiniature Version A (SMA) antennas. The RF antennas connect to the CubeSats using an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SMA connector</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe development process has been one of the most formative experiences of my career so far,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cWorking through the payload design and validation and meeting with these teams has given me so much experience, especially for my age.\u201d</p><p>Her payload is expected to be launched early next year.</p><h2>An aerospace internship at MIT</h2><p>Merchant is an intern at the MIT <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/node/2873\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school\u2019s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups.

It turned engineering from a dream to reality.\u201d</p><p>In that role, Merchant is focusing on cognitive cartography, a method for structuring complex information into semantic maps that reveal how ideas and concepts relate to one another. She uses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U1S0WSsPuE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embedding models</a>, a type of machine learning that converts information into numerical representations. The embeddings allow computers to recognize similarities and relationships between concepts, even when they are described in different ways. The approach helps an AI product understand how ideas connect, rather than treating each piece of data as isolated.</p><p>\u201cBeing one of the youngest people in the lab is daunting,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m really excited to learn from engineers and researchers who are working at the cutting edge of the field.\u201d</p><p>She says she is hoping to attend MIT or <a href=\"https://www.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford</a>.</p><h2>The future of IEEE</h2><p>Merchant was introduced to IEEE by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnjuisai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Jusai</a>, former finance chair of the <a href=\"https://ewh.ieee.org/r3/orlando/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Orlando Section</a>.</p><p>Her first personal experience with the organization happened in 2023 while she was conducting research for a science fair project.

The first vertiport will be near Dubai International Airport, with additional ones planned for Dubai Mall, the Atlantis the Royal resort, and American University in Dubai.</p><p>Joby won\u2019t be the first eVTOL developer to carry passengers. That distinction goes to China\u2019s EHang, which is already conducting limited sightseeing and<a href=\"https://www.ehang.com/news/1275.html\" target=\"_blank\"> demonstration flights</a> with its two-seat, autonomous electric multicopters. (Joby\u2019s aircraft are piloted.) If Joby pulls off its goal, however, it will be the first to routinely fly passengers from point to point over urban traffic, in keeping with Uber Elevate\u2019s original vision. Its exclusive agreement in Dubai will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis, which includes a handful of other Western eVTOL developers, plus a growing number of Chinese players. Besides its Dubai deal, Joby also has a partnership with Delta to start an airport shuttle service in the United States.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A futuristic-looking electric rotorcraft is seen flying in a blue sky.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b31d3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-futuristic-looking-electric-rotorcraft-is-seen-flying-in-a-blue-sky.jpg?id=62599883&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Joby S4 electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft has six electric motors, each weighing 28 kilograms and capable of a peak output of 236 kilowatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joby Aviation</small></p><p>Operating a reliable air taxi service is a demanding proposition that will require Joby\u2019s aircraft, charging infrastructure, and scheduling software to perform safely and reliably day in and day out. Since every new and complex technology has teething problems, Joby envisions fairly limited initial operations in 2026.</p><p>\u201cWe will transition from test flights to more complex proving runs and eventually nonpaying passenger flights out of the completed vertiports, ensuring a seamless passenger experience ahead of full commercial launch,\u201d says Khoury. He adds that Joby is currently working with Skyports to ready its initial vertiports and with government agencies in Dubai and the UAE to receive the necessary approvals for its operations.</p><p>\u201cDubai\u2019s approach is deeper and more comprehensive than what you see in many of the headlines,\u201d said Clint Harper, an aviation infrastructure and policy advisor who recently participated in an advanced air mobility workshop with Dubai\u2019s RTA. \u201cIn our workshop,\u201d he says, \u201cthe RTA staff had fantastic questions and concerns regarding safety, security, and system-level integration. Everyone recognized and appreciated strong government support and wanted to deliver the right system solution, not just a one-off demo. I was thoroughly impressed and inspired.\u201d</p><h2>Initial Air Operations Will Precede an Airworthiness Certificate</h2><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"groundwork\">Notably, all of this groundwork is taking place in advance of Joby receiving an initial type certificate for its aircraft from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In the United States (and elsewhere), a type certificate is typically a prerequisite for conducting commercial operations with paying passengers. Joby claims it\u2019s making good progress toward FAA certification, but how quickly (or slowly) that process moves is largely out of its hands. In recent years, the FAA has been taking longer to certify even conventional airplanes and helicopters, which the industry blames on staffing shortages at the agency and more cautious decision-making in the wake of the<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/boeing-plea-737-max-crashes-b34daa014406657e720bec4a990dccf6\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing 737 Max crisis</a>.</p><p>This perception that certification delays have more to do with bureaucracy than safety may be why Dubai is willing to approve some early operations by Joby in advance of FAA type certification. Interestingly, the United States is now following the UAE\u2019s example. In September, the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation began soliciting proposals for an<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-new-plan-fast-track-advanced-air\" target=\"_blank\"> eVTOL Integration Pilot Program</a> (eIPP), which will select at least five projects to demonstrate eVTOL operations in the national airspace starting as early as summer 2026.</p><p>The FAA has<a href=\"https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-policy/trump-executive-order-drones-will-shape-us-evtol-roll-out/\" target=\"_blank\"> stated</a> that the eIPP won\u2019t allow eVTOL developers to bypass certification requirements or carry paying passengers. However, it will enable them to undertake additional testing and demonstration flights as a stepping-stone to commercial operations. Joby says it\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-plans-to-jumpstart-us-operations-through-eipp/\" target=\"_blank\"> planning to take part</a> in the eIPP, meaning its air taxis could also be flying over U.S. cities in 2026\u2014even if the only person on board is the pilot.</p>"

But following a string of reversals and environmental mishaps, the facilities began going into a decline in the 1990s and 2000s. At the same time, Chinese producers, which were much less confined by environmental regulations, <a href=\"https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-rare-earth-elements-dominance-in-global-supply-chains/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">began their astonishingly rapid ascendence</a>.</p><p>Today, China controls <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/china-s-share-in-rare-earth-magnet-production-2024\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">between about 85 and 99 percent</a> of the global market for key rare earth oxides and metals, on which huge and vital tech-based industries depend. The United States and its allies find themselves at China\u2019s mercy for certain rare earths, including ones that are essential for motors, semiconductors, electroluminescent compounds, optoelectronics, and catalysis. They\u2019re in critical components of countless military systems, such as ones in aircraft, submarines, weapons, and night-vision gear.</p><p>For these reasons, the resumption of mass production of rare earths at Mountain Pass, which was greatly <a href=\"https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scaled up during 2025</a>, was a major development in geopolitics. The total output of the mine and its associated processing facilities, where the rare earth ore is turned into industrially useful oxides, <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-30-years-of-rare-earth-production-by-country/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">is small</a>, however, compared to China\u2019s output.</p><p>The Trump administration invested a lot of time during 2025 trying to set up deals to establish rare-earth supply chains that do not depend on China. This effort <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/canada-may-be-united-states-best-hope-minerals-security\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">started puzzlingly</a>, with some high-profile arm twisting of Ukraine, whose deposits are dismissed by mining experts. And also with overtures about annexing Greenland, a district of Denmark whose rare-earth deposits are enormous but, like Ukraine\u2019s, are not attractive from a mining standpoint. As the year wore on, the administration eventually settled on a strategy similar to that of the Biden administration, which emphasized investing in domestic production and working with allies, such as Australia, to strengthen and expand existing mining, refining, and magnet-making operations outside of the United States.</p><p>Mostly overlooked by the administration so far has been Canada (also one of Trump\u2019s annexation targets). Canada has some exceptionally large reserves of rare earth elements, and it operates one of only about four sizable rare-earth-oxide refining plants outside of Asia.

So researchers have long investigated alternative means of propulsion, some involving the use of intense magnetic fields to accelerate and direct ions to produce thrust. At Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, researchers have demonstrated <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-propulsion-thruster\" target=\"_self\">one such system</a>, which is based on applied-field <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoplasmadynamic_thruster\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">magnetoplasmadynamic</a> thrusters. Their twist is using high-temperature superconducting tape to greatly reduce the power required to energize the electromagnets to achieve a given magnetic-field strength. H\u0113ki, a technology demonstration comprised of the novel superconducting components of the system, minus the thruster itself, was launched to the International Space Station in September.

But the quality of their work still suffers, clocking in at about a 50 percent success rate on the hardest tasks.

No single standard could optimize for both ultralow power and high speed, so the IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ieee802.org/15/\" target=\"_blank\">802.15 working group</a> developed separate tracks for different use cases\u2014some for devices that needed to last years on a battery, others for devices that needed to move data fast. That patchwork of specialized standards has shaped the smart-home landscape ever since.</p><p>One kind of mesh, Lee says, they developed for high-speed data transfers between devices that demand more power\u2014think laptops, smartphones, and plugged-in smart-home hubs. The other they tailored for slow, occasional data exchanges involving only tiny power budgets\u2014devices such as door sensors, leak detectors, and environmental monitors that might need to last months or years between charges.</p><p>\u201cThat split alone illustrates why a single mesh standard is difficult,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBecause edge applications simply do not share a common set of constraints.\u201d</p><p>Something similar is happening in 2026. Thread is now poised to handle smart-home devices and always-on sensors. But homes also need ultrafast Wi-Fi for laptops and phones and streaming video. That\u2019s where Wi-Fi 7 mesh comes in. And because these two mesh networks speak entirely different languages, a Matter translation layer is still needed between the two. Both <a href=\"https://www.delloro.com/news/wi-fi-7-to-drive-double-digit-enterprise-wlan-growth-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi 7</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)#Versions\" target=\"_blank\">Matter</a> (in their most stable and interoperable versions) arrived en masse in products hitting store shelves in 2025. This is the year they\u2019re all finally ready to work together.</p><p>So mesh success, in 2026, looks less like victory and more like invisibility.</p><p>Consider a user opening up an app on their phone, and over their Wi-Fi mesh connection, tapping a button to unlock a smart door lock inside their home using Thread. If this sequence just works, with no setup headaches or incompatibility warnings, without the user ever needing to know whether Wi-Fi 7 or Thread 1.4 ultimately relayed the message that unlocked the door, then the convergence was successful.</p><p>The technologies themselves haven\u2019t transitioned into a single, unified mesh standard. But they will have at least stopped getting in each other\u2019s way. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

They can view with the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects as faint smudges that don\u2019t even begin to capture their majesty, or they can capture long-exposure images with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electronically-assisted-astronomy\" target=\"_blank\">astrocameras</a> and display the results on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing experience.</p><p>Stand-alone telescope eyepieces with active light amplification do exist for a real-time viewing, but commercial products are pricey, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars. I wanted something I could use for the public-astronomy observation nights that I organize in my community. So I decided to build a low-cost DIY amplifying eyepiece, to make it easier for visitors to observe deep-sky objects but without requiring a large financial investment on my part.</p><p>I quickly realized there was already an industry replete with hardware for handling low-light conditions\u2014the security-camera industry. Faced with the challenge of monitoring areas with a variety of lighting, often using cameras spread out over a large facility, makers of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras created a video standard that uses digital sensors to capture images but then transmits them as HD-resolution analog signals over coaxial cables. By using this <a href=\"https://www.teracomsolutions.com.au/FAQ/ahd_explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Analog High Definition (AHD) transmission standard</a>, you can attach new cameras to preexisting long cable runs and still get a high-quality image. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Primary components for the amplifying eyepiece.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c19df\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/primary-components-for-the-amplifying-eyepiece.jpg?id=62609418&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A CMOS-image sensor module from a security camera [top left], a USB capture card [bottom left], and an OLED viewfinder [right] process analog video data.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>While I didn\u2019t need the long-distance capability of these cameras, I was very interested in their low price and ability to handle dim conditions. The business end of these cameras is a module that integrates a <a href=\"https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2017/cg_1.html\" target=\"_blank\">CMOS image sensor</a> with supporting electronics. After some research, I settled on <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805192137246.html?gatewayAdapt=fra2usa4itemAdapt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a module</a> that combined a 2-megapixel <a href=\"https://www.sony-semicon.com/files/62/flyer_security/IMX307LQD_LQR_Flyer.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sony IMX307</a> sensor with a supporting <a href=\"https://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/SPEC/661/K1196433661.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NVP2441 chipset</a>.</p><p>The key factor was choosing a sensor-chipset combination that supports something called Starlight or<a href=\"https://www.cctvcore.com/blog/Slow-Shutter-Speed-Techincal-Article\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Sens-Up</a> mode. This makes the camera more sensitive to light than the human eye, albeit at the cost of a little speed. Images are created by integrating approximately 1.2 seconds of exposure time on the sensor. That might make for choppy security footage, but it\u2019s not noticeable when making observations of nebulae and other astronomical objects (unless of course something <em><em>really</em></em> weird happens in the sky!)</p><h2>From Astronomy To Security Cameras and Back Again</h2><p>The existence of the Sens-up mode is actually part of the technical heritage of digital imaging sensors. CMOS sensors were<a href=\"https://ericfossum.com/Presentations/1993%20Feb%20Active%20Pixel%20Sensors%20Are%20CCDs%20Dinosaurs%20SPIE%20Feb%2093.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> developed as a successor</a> to charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which were eagerly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device#Use_in_astronomy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embraced by the astronomical community</a> following their introduction in 1970, replacing long-exposure photographic plates. However, the ability to take exposure frames as long as one second is rarely something that CCTV cameras are designed for: It can be more of a drawback than a feature, leading to blurred images of moving objects or people.</p><p>As a result, this capability is rarely mentioned in the product descriptions, and so finding the right module was the most challenging part: I had to buy three different camera modules before finally landing on one that worked.</p><p>The output from the camera module is passed to a <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808460958932.html?gatewayAdapt=fra2usa4itemAdapt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">digital viewfinder</a>, which displays both the video and control menus generated by the module. These menus are navigated using a four-way, press-to-select joystick that connects to a dedicated header on the module.</p><p>The output of the camera is also passed to a <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805840413018.html?gatewayAdapt=fra2usa4itemAdapt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">capture card</a> that converts the analog signal to digital and provides a USB-C interface, which allows images to be seen and saved using a smartphone. All the electronics can be powered via battery for complete stand-alone operation or from a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-intel-piix3-usb-interface\" target=\"_blank\">USB</a> cable attached to the capture card.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Diagram showing connections between CMOS sensor, joystick, OLED, analog HD, viewfinder, USB.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8ddb1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-showing-connections-between-cmos-sensor-joystick-oled-analog-hd-viewfinder-usb.jpg?id=62609449&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The analog HD module can be controlled directly using a joystick to navigate onscreen menus. Power can be provided externally via USB-C connector on the capture card or via an optional battery pack.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>The components fit in an enclosure I made from 3D-printed parts, designed to match the 32-millimeter diameter of most telescope eyepieces for easy mounting. The whole thing cost less than US $250. </p><h2>Testing out the Amplifying Eyepiece</h2><p>I took my new amplifying eyepiece out with my <a href=\"https://www.celestron.com/products/c11-optical-tube-assembly-cge-dovetail?srsltid=AfmBOor1i9qRc7qTRPKMtlerPIaX7zOkiJDj7rkUGlagXo0c1ngKwrGx\" target=\"_blank\">Celestron C11</a> telescope to give it a try. Soon I had in my viewfinder the Dumbbell Nebula, also known as Messier 27/M27, which is normally quite hard to see. It was significantly brighter compared to a naked-eye observation. Certainly the difference wasn\u2019t as marked as with a commercial rig that has noise-reducing cooling for the sensor electronics. But it was still an enormous improvement and for a fraction of the cost.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A photograph of a cloudy purple and white deep-sky object.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8eaec\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-photograph-of-a-cloudy-purple-and-white-deep-sky-object.jpg?id=62609420&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Orion Nebula, some 1,340 light years away.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jordan Blanchard</small></p><p>The amplifier is also more versatile: You can remove it from the telescope, and with a 2.8-mm HD lens fitted to the camera-module sensor, you can use it as a night-vision camera. That\u2019s handy when trying to operate in dark outdoor conditions on starry nights!</p>For the future, I\u2019d like to upgrade the USB-C capture module to one that can handle the sensor\u2019s digital output directly, rather than just the analog signal. This would give a noticeable boost in resolution when recording or streaming to a phone or computer. Beyond that, I\u2019m interested in finding another low-cost camera module with a longer exposure, and refining the 3D-printed housing so it\u2019s easier to build and adapt to other observing setups. That way the eyepiece will stay affordable, but people can still push it toward more serious electronically assisted astronomy."

But as I prepare for this year\u2019s event, here are some of the devices that have already caught my eye. </p><h2>Headphones that can read your brainwaves</h2><p>Electroencephalography, or EEG, has been used in health care for decades to monitor neural activity. It usually involves a person wearing a whole helmet of electrodes, but scaled-down versions of the tech are now being integrated into consumer devices and may soon be ready for users. </p><p>Several neurotech companies using EEG will be at CES this year. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.neurable.com/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neurable</a> (a company we\u2019ve had <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/brainy-startup-neurable-unveils-the-worlds-first-braincontrolled-vr-game\" target=\"_self\">on our radar for years</a>) is announcing a new headset with gaming brand HyperX, which is meant to help players hone their focus by tracking brain activity in real time. Neurable\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.neurable.com/products/mw75neurolt?variant=48878808236278\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">over-ear EEG headphones</a> for everyday use are now available for preorder.  <a href=\"https://www.naox.tech/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Naox</a> will also bring its in-ear EEG tech to consumer-oriented earbuds. And <a href=\"https://elemindtech.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elemind</a>, another <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/elemind-neuromodulation\" target=\"_self\">company we\u2019ve covered</a>, aims to help you sleep with its headband. With wearables already monitoring vital signs, sleep, and activity, 2026 may be the year our brainwaves join the list of biosignals we can track on a daily basis. </p><h2><span>A toothbrush to sniff out health issues</span></h2><div><span>Sonic toothbrush company <a href=\"https://y-brush.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Y-Brush</a> is <a href=\"https://y-brush.co/pages/ces-announcement-ybrush-halo\" target=\"_blank\">introducing dental tech</a> analyzing another biomarker: smelly breath. The toothbrush itself is y-shaped and looks almost like a dental retainer on a stick, with bristles surrounding the teeth. In the latest version, the Y-Brush Halo, a gas sensor called SmartNose is integrated to analyze breath biomarkers. The company says this allows the toothbrush to detect more than 300 health conditions, including early-stage diabetes and liver disorders. </span></div><h2><span></span>Automatic massage roller to sooth sore muscles</h2><p><a href=\"https://rheofit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RheoFit</a>\u2019s A1 massage roller basically looks like what would happen if a foam roller and a massage chair had a baby. The device automatically rolls itself down your spine and offers two replaceable surfaces: one harder material that mimics a masseuse\u2019s knuckles, and a gentler option that\u2019s meant to feel more like an open palm. </p><p><span>This will be the second year the RheoFit A1 is on display. To find out whether it\u2019s worth the US $449 price tag, I\u2019ll have to try it out on site. </span></p><h2>Minimalist e-ink smartphone to cut out distractions</h2><p>Just before last year\u2019s CES, several devices were <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/calm-tech\" target=\"_blank\">awarded a new certification</a> meant to reward tech designed to be less distracting. While most exhibitors will keep competing for our attention, a few are tapping into a desire for calm and clarity. </p><p>Minimalist tech company <a href=\"https://mudita.com/products/phones/\" target=\"_blank\">Mudita</a>, for instance, will be showing its e-ink smartphone, which began shipping in 2025. The phone is designed to reduce screen time with its black-and-white, paperlike display, and the operating system is designed to run without Google. Like other not-as-smart phones (such as the Wisephone or Light Phone), the Mudita Kompakt offers the essentials\u2014messaging, maps, camera, and so forth\u2014without constant notifications. </p><h2>Food allergen detector to avoid anaphylaxis</h2><p>Some new tech surprises users with an experience they didn\u2019t know they wanted. Others aim to offer the solutions you\u2019ve dreamt about. For me, French startup <a href=\"https://www.allergen-alert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Allergen Alert</a> falls into the second category. </p><p>The startup, one of the listed exhibitors at an early press event on 4 January, is developing a portable system to test food allergens in real time. I\u2019ve been eating gluten-free for most of my life (not by choice), and I know how easily allergens can sneak into a dish with just a sprinkle of flour, or a dash of soy sauce\u2014especially when you\u2019re traveling or eating out. For many people with severe allergies, a device like this could be a lifesaver. </p><p><em>This story was updated on 5 January, 2026 to add that Neurable announced a new headset with HyperX. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the company was displaying its MW75 Neuro at CES. This has been removed.</em><br /></p>"

It was chosen for him by his mother when he was 8, and he quickly lost interest as a teenager. While growing up close to Moscow, his adolescent passions were instead channeled into electronics and tinkering with gadgets in after-school classes. This led to a career working on environmental-monitoring devices, sensors for commercial drones, and most recently, sensor systems at autonomous-vehicle developer <a href=\"https://www.avride.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Avride</a>\u2019s R&amp;D hub in Austin, Texas.</p><h3>Sergey Antonovich</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer</strong></p><p> Avride</p><p><strong>Occupation</strong></p><p>Embedded systems developer</p><p><strong>Education </strong></p><p>Master\u2019s degree in engineering physics, Moscow Engineering Physics Institute</p><p>But when Antonovich picked his accordion back up as an adult, he discovered both latent musical skills and a newfound appreciation for the instrument. Like any good tinkerer, he had some ideas about how he could improve it and he soon began using his electronics knowledge to build custom devices.</p><p>And Antonovich says he\u2019s found a surprising harmony between his day job and his hobby. Whether you\u2019re ensuring that an autonomous vehicle spots obstacles in the road in time or translating a musician\u2019s nimble finger work into a melodious tune, you need to rapidly process digital signals from the underlying hardware.</p><p>\u201cBoth systems, self-driving cars and accordions, are real-time embedded systems,\u201d says Antonovich. \u201cA self-driving car is more complicated because it contains many more components, but the principles are more or less equal.\u201d</p><h2>Electronics Trumps Music</h2><p>Antonovich grew up in Chekhov, a small town outside Moscow, and says he had a pretty ordinary childhood. His father passed away when he was only 1, so he was brought up by his mother, who worked in the printing industry, and his grandmother, a school principal who taught Russian.</p><p>At 8 he was enrolled in a local music school where he learned the fundamentals of music theory and the accordion. He was a dutiful student, he says, but never felt much passion for the instrument his mother picked for him and stopped playing when he was about 15.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sergey Antonovich shows off the digital instruments he makes in his free time. With one lightweight instrument, he becomes a one-man band.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sergey Antonovich</small> </p><p>That was also when Antonovich had his first encounter with the world of electronics. He started attending after-school classes where he was taught to solder and build simple electronic systems. Antonovich quickly caught the bug and was soon knocking together digital doorbells, code locks, and basic radio receivers in his spare time.</p><p>His family encouraged him to enroll at a technical secondary school, which taught engineering skills alongside the standard curriculum. When it came to picking a university, he decided he wanted a grounding in physics, so he enrolled at the <a href=\"https://eng.mephi.ru/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moscow Engineering Physics Institute</a> in 2004, choosing a program that taught a combination of hardware, software, and digital-signal processing.</p><p>Antonovich originally planned to become a software developer but quickly fell in love with hardware. \u201cWhen you develop software, there is a level of abstraction between you and the thing itself,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you work with hardware, you understand how this particular thing actually works.\u201d</p><h2>Embedding Into a Career</h2><p>Toward the end of his degree studies, in 2009, Antonovich started working for Moscow-based <a href=\"https://ecosfera.com.ru/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ecosfera</a>, a company focused on environmental and labor-safety measurement devices. He continued working for the company after graduating in 2010, designing hardware and software to measure conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to ensure safe workplaces.</p><p>It was a niche field, but one with strict regulatory requirements, and he had to shepherd his devices through rigorous certification procedures, the first major accomplishment of his career. From there, he worked for a variety of companies on different embedded and Internet of Things systems, including ATMs, medical devices, sensors for commercial drones, and digital price tags. Then in 2021 he interviewed at internet company <a href=\"https://yandex.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yandex</a>, which operates Russia\u2019s most popular search engine, to work on its autonomous vehicle program.</p><p>\u201cI remember I was approaching the office entrance and I saw a car which was driving itself,\u201d Antonovich says. \u201cYou see it on YouTube, but it\u2019s not such an inspiring experience. It\u2019s really inspiring when you see it live.\u201d</p><p>He got the job and started work as a software engineer developing vehicle sensor systems and testing infrastructure. A corporate restructuring saw Yandex\u2019s autonomous vehicle division spun off as a new company called Avride. Antonovich worked for the company in Israel for about a year, then in 2024 moved to its new headquarters in Austin.</p><p>Antonovich says he works at Arvide primarily on the data that feed the vehicle\u2019s perception algorithms, which includes radar and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar-on-a-chip\" target=\"_blank\">lidar</a>. Both kinds of sensors have strengths and weaknesses\u2014radar has long range but low resolution, while lidar is great at picking out shapes but only up to a certain distance\u2014so the algorithmic perception system combines the data. Antonovich\u2019s job is to build the diagnostic systems that ensure these sensors are working in perfect synchrony and deliver data within tight time limits.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Person holding a laptop standing in front of a white autonomous vehicle.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5abc5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-holding-a-laptop-standing-in-front-of-a-white-autonomous-vehicle.jpg?id=62609270&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In his day job, Antonovich works on the sensor systems for self-driving cars. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sergey Antonovich</small></p><p>Moving to the United States has been a positive change for Antonovich. On a professional front, the country\u2019s soft-touch regulatory approach toward autonomous vehicles has allowed the company to make rapid progress on its technology. But he says the move has also helped him indulge his tinkering instincts in his spare time.</p><p>\u201cAs a maker, I would say [the United States] is a paradise,\u201d he says. \u201cElectronic components are very accessible. You just order them and they arrive very quickly and everything just works.\u201d Antonovich has taken full advantage of this to dive into his other passion\u2014building musical instruments.</p><h2>A Musical Repris</h2><p>In 2017, when he was still living in Russia, Antonovich noticed a new generation of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/two-commodore-64s-one-accordion\" target=\"_blank\">digital accordions</a> emerging and it sparked his curiosity. \u201cI thought, why not try to modify my own [acoustic] accordion?\u201d he says.</p><p>He dusted off his instrument and was gratified to find that he could still play and read sheet music. So, he tried to tackle some of the problems that beset digital accordions. Commercially available instruments are typically large and heavy, rely on bulky external modules to add musical accompaniment such as a drum beat, and connect to amplifiers with wires that restrict the performer\u2019s movement.</p><p>\u201cI decided that maybe I can build a self-contained device,\u201d he says. Starting with an acoustic accordion as a base, he added a synthesizer, installed internal microphones to capture acoustic sounds that could then be blended with digital ones, and integrated wireless transmitters that could free performers from cables and let them move about the stage freely.</p><p>Surprisingly, Antonovich found a lot of overlap with his work on self-driving cars\u2014in particular, the need to manage latency along the signal-processing chain. To provide a seamless experience to the player, a digital accordion needs to rapidly route input from dozens of buttons and keys on two separate keyboards to the synthesizer, which has its own processing delay.</p><p>\u201cYour main task as a developer is to keep latency as low as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cA high quality system should produce sound in less than 10 milliseconds, and if you come over this threshold it\u2019s very uncomfortable to play.\u201d</p><p>Antonovich now has a growing menagerie of both hybrid acoustic-digital and fully digital accordions. But while he\u2019s built accordions for friends, he\u2019s in no hurry to turn his hobby into a business. \u201cMaking them a commercial product will turn my curiosity to necessity,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you do something for a living, you do it because you have to and not because you choose to.\u201d</p>"

We go our own way here, getting out into the field to bring you news of the hidden gems that genuinely\u2014as the IEEE motto goes\u2014advance technology for the benefit of humanity.</p><p>A look back at the last 20 years of January issues reveals that while we\u2019ve certainly covered our share of huge tech projects, like the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-last-first-light-for-the-james-webb-space-telescope\" target=\"_self\">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, many of the stories touch on subjects most people would have otherwise missed.</p><p>Last January, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz reported on startups that are piloting <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ocean-carbon-removal\" target=\"_self\">ocean-based carbon capture</a>. This issue, she\u2019s back with another CO<span><sub>2</sub></span>-centric story, this time focused on grid-scale storage, which is poised to blow up\u2014literally. Waltz traveled to Sardinia to check out Milan-based <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co2-battery-energy-storage\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Dome\u2019s \u201cbubble battery,\u201d</a> which can store up to 200 megawatt-hours by compressing and decompressing pure carbon dioxide inside an inflatable dome.</p><p>This kind of modular, easy-to-deploy energy storage could be especially useful for AI data centers, says Senior Editor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/technology-forecast-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Samuel K. Moore</a>, who curated this issue and wrote about <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/gravity-energy-storage-will-show-its-potential-in-2021\" target=\"_self\">gravity energy storage</a> back in January 2021.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquefy cancer tumors.</p><p> \u201cWhen we think about energy storage, our minds usually go to grid-scale batteries,\u201d Moore says. \u201cYet these bubbles, which are in many ways more capable than batteries, will be sprouting up all over the place, often in association with computing infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>For his story in this issue, Moore dove into the competition between two startups that are developing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rf-over-fiber\" target=\"_blank\">radio-based cables to replace conventional copper cables and fiber optics in data centers</a>. These radio systems can connect processors 10 to 20 meters apart using a third of the power of optical-fiber cables and at a third of the cost. The next step is to integrate the radio connections directly with GPUs, to ease cooling burdens and help data centers and the AI models running on them continue to scale up.</p><p>Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquify cancer tumors, as Greg Uyeno found when reporting on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ultrasound-cancer-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">HistoSonics\u2019 ultrasound treatment</a>. Feared for its aggressive nature and extremely low survival rate, pancreatic cancer kills <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9476884/#:~:text=Core%20tip:%20Pancreatic%20cancer%2C%20as,critical%20for%20global%20cancer%20control.\" target=\"_blank\">almost half a million people</a> per year worldwide. <a href=\"https://histosonics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HistoSonics</a> uses noninvasive, focused ultrasound to create cavitation bubbles that destroy tumors without dangerously heating surrounding tissue. This year, the company is concluding kidney trials as well as launching pancreatic cancer trials.</p><p>Over the last two decades, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> has regularly covered the rise of drones. In 2018, for instance, we reported that the startup <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/zipline-expands-its-medical-delivery-drones-across-east-africa\" target=\"_self\">Zipline would deploy autonomous drones</a> to deliver blood and medical supplies in rural Rwanda. Today, <a href=\"https://www.zipline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zipline</a> has a market cap of about US $4 billion and operates in several African countries, Japan, and the United States, having completed almost 2 million drone deliveries. In this issue, journalist Robb Mandelbaum takes us inside the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wildfire-drones\" target=\"_blank\">Wildfire XPrize competition</a>, aimed at providing another life-saving service: dousing wildfires before they grow out of control. Zipline succeeded because it could make deliveries to remote locations much faster than land vehicles. This year\u2019s XPrize teams plan to detect and suppress fires faster than conventional firefighting methods.</p><p>In addition to these emerging technologies, we\u2019ve packed this issue with a dozen others, including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/porsche-wireless-ev-charging\" target=\"_blank\">Porsche\u2019s wireless home charger for EVs</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/joby-air-taxi\" target=\"_blank\">the world\u2019s first electric air taxi service</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/neutral-atom-quantum-computing\" target=\"_blank\">neutral-atom quantum computers</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mesh-network-interoperable-thread\" target=\"_blank\">interoperable mesh networks</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/11-amazing-engineering-events-in-2026\" target=\"_blank\">robotic baseball umpires</a>.
