Using census data, we document large average improvements across all outcomes, alongside substantial heterogeneity by gender and race. Among women, health gains led to changes in marriage and fertility that partially offset their labor market improvements. Among Black Americans, we uncover a pronounced gradient linked to systemic racial discrimination in the pre\u2013Civil Rights era: individuals born in more discriminatory Jim Crow states realized much smaller gains than those born in less discriminatory states, despite larger reductions in pneumonia exposure. There is no similar gradient among white Americans. Together, these findings highlight the central role of institutional environments in shaping whether investments in early-life health translate into long-run socioeconomic gains."

Drawing on the seminal macroeconomic frameworks by Nelson-Phelps, Lucas and subsequent developments, alongside macro and microeconomic evidence, we examine the role of human capital in driving innovation and growth. We highlight how different types of human capital, characterized by education level, matter in different stages of development. Despite documented increases in years of schooling, the world\u2019s poorest regions still see stagnating outcomes in learning and education quality, potentially creating poverty traps where investments in neither physical nor human capital materialize. We discuss obstacles to human capital accumulation through a simple analytical framework and present evidence from randomized interventions spanning early childhood programs to school-age initiatives, assessing policies that can effectively remove barriers to skill acquisition and establish foundations for sustained growth."

We define women's household power as their influence over household choices, distinguishing it from broader empowerment concepts. We review economic models, including unitary, collective, and bargaining frameworks, and map these to empirical approaches. We then discuss measurement methods  such as structural estimation of consumption allocation, survey measures, and laboratory experiments. On the determinants of women's power, we find that some approaches, such as transfers targeted to women, show mixed results, while others, such as increasing women's control over their earnings, show clearer positive impacts. On the effects of women's power, we pay special attention to children's human capital. Few studies provide strong evidence that mothers invest more in children than fathers do, but collectively the evidence suggests such an effect. We conclude by highlighting research and methodological gaps."

We show that the key lessons from this literature also apply to investment using a model where heterogeneous firms face idiosyncratic productivity risk and financial frictions: constrained firms\u2019 investment depends on their free cash flow, generating indirect effects of monetary policy and implying that transfer payments stimulate investment demand. Quantitatively, the strength of these new mechanisms is governed by firms\u2019 marginal propensities to invest (MPIs), similar to the role of marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) for households. But unlike MPCs, we currently lack quasi-experimental evidence about MPIs that we can use to directly discipline the new mechanisms."

For elderly or disabled drivers, those bulky cords can <a href=\"https://www.ridc.org.uk/transport/inaccessible-charging-barrier-electric-disabled-and-older-drivers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">be a physical challenge.</a></p><p>As it was for smartphones years ago, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-charging\" target=\"_self\">wireless EV charging</a> has been the dream. But there\u2019s a difference of nearly four orders of magnitude between the roughly 14 watt-hours of a typical smartphone battery and that of a large EV. That\u2019s what makes the wireless charging on the 108-kilowatt-hour pack in the forthcoming Porsche Cayenne Electric so notable.</p><p>To offer the first inductive charger on a production car, Porsche had to overcome both technical and practical challenges\u2014such as how to protect a beloved housecat prowling below your car. The German automaker demonstrated the system at September\u2019s <a href=\"https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2025/products/porsche-demonstrates-inductive-charging-at-iaa.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IAA Mobility</a> show in Munich.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>With its <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a65810736/2026-porsche-cayenne-electric-prototype-drive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-volt architecture</a>, the Cayenne Electric can charge at up to 400 kW at a public DC station, enough to fill its pack from 10 to 80 percent in about 16 minutes. The wireless system delivers about 11 kW for Level 2 charging at home, where Porsche says three out of four of its customers do nearly all their fill-ups. Pull the Cayenne into a garage and align it over a floor-mounted plate, and the SUV will charge from 10 to 80 percent in about 7.5 hours. No plugs, tangled cords, or dirty hands. Porsche will offer a single-phase, 48-ampere version for the United States after buyers see their first Cayennes in mid-2026, and a <a href=\"https://cc-techgroup.com/single-phase-vs-three-phase-power/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">three-phase</a>, 16-A system in Europe.</p><h2>Porsche\u2019s Wireless Charging is Based on an Old Concept</h2><p>The concept of inductive charging has been around for more than a century. Two coils of copper wire are positioned near one another. A current flowing through one coil creates a magnetic field, which induces voltage in the second coil.</p><p>In the Porsche system, the floor-mounted pad, 78 centimeters wide, plugs into the home\u2019s electrical panel. Inside the pad, which weighs 50 kilograms, grid electricity (at 60 hertz in the United States, 50 Hz in most of the rest of the world) is converted to DC and then to high-frequency AC at 2,000 V.The resulting <a href=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1493137\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">85-kilohertz</a> magnetic field extends from the pad to the Cayenne, where it is converted again to DC voltage.</p><p>The waterproof pad can also be placed outdoors, and the company says it\u2019s unaffected by leaves, snow, and the like. In fact, the air-cooled pad can get warm enough to melt any snow, reaching temperatures as high as 50 \u00b0C.</p><p>The Cayenne\u2019s onboard charging hardware mounts between its front electric motor and battery. The 15-kg induction unit wires directly into the battery.</p><p>In most EVs, plug-in (conductive) AC charging tops out at <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36062942/evs-explained-charging-losses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">around 95 percent</a> efficiency. Porsche says its wireless system delivers 90 percent efficiency, despite an air gap of roughly 12 to 18 cm between the pad and vehicle.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory transferred an impressive <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kilowatts</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency.</span></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re super proud that we\u2019re just below conductive AC in charging efficiency,\u201d says Simon Schulze, Porsche\u2019s product manager for charging hardware. Porsche also beats inductive phone chargers, which typically max out at about 70 percent efficiency, Schulze says.</p><p>When the car gets within 7.5 meters of the charging pad, the Cayenne\u2019s screen-based parking-assist system turns on automatically. Then comes a kind of video game that requires the driver to align a pair of green circles on-screen, one representing the car, the other the pad. It\u2019s like a digital version of the tennis ball some people hang in their garage to gauge parking distance. There\u2019s ample wiggle room, with tolerances of 20 cm left to right, and 15 cm fore and aft. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss it,\u201d according to Schulze.</p><p>Induction loops detect any objects between the charging plate and the vehicle; such objects, if they\u2019re metal, could heat up dangerously. Radar sensors detect any living things near the pad, and will halt the charging if necessary. People can walk near the car or hop aboard without affecting a charging session.</p><p>Christian Holler, Porsche\u2019s head of charging systems, says the system conforms to International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection standards for electromagnetic radiation. The field remains below 15 microteslas, so it\u2019s safe for <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/devices-that-may-interfere-with-icds-and-pacemakers\" target=\"_blank\">people with pacemakers</a>, Porsche insists. And the aforementioned cat wouldn\u2019t be harmed even if it strayed into the magnetic field, though \u201cits metal collar might get warm,\u201d Schulze says.</p><p>The Porsche system\u2019s 90 percent efficiency is impressive but not record-setting. Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) transferred <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kW</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency, boosting its state of charge by 50 percent in 10 minutes. That <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-ev-charging-2668791896\" target=\"_self\">world-record wireless rate</a> relied on polyphase windings for coils, part of a U.S. Department of Energy project that was backed by Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company.</p><p>That effort, Holler says, spawned a Ph.D. paper from VW engineer <a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/9126/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Foote</a>. Yet the project had different goals from the one that led to the Cayenne charging system. ORNL was focused on maximum power transfer, regardless of cost, production feasibility, or reliability, he says.</p><p>By contrast, designing a system for showroom cars \u201crequires a completely different level of quality and processes,\u201d Holler says.</p><h2>High Cost Could Limit Adoption</h2><p> Cayenne buyers in Europe will pay around \u20ac7,000 (roughly US $8,100) for the optional charger. Porsche has yet to price it for the United States.</p><p> Loren McDonald, chief executive of Chargeonomics, an EV-charging analysis firm, said wireless charging \u201cis clearly the future,\u201d with use cases such as driverless robotaxis, curbside charging, or at any site \u201cwhere charging cables might be an annoyance or even a safety issue.\u201d</p><p>But for now, inductive charging\u2019s costly, low-volume status will limit it to niche models and high-income adopters, McDonald says. Public adoption will be critical \u201cso that drivers can convenience-charge throughout their driving day\u2014which then increases the benefits of spending more money on the system.\u201d</p><p>Porsche acknowledges that issue; the system conforms to wireless standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers so that other automakers might help popularize the technology.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want this to be proprietary, a Porsche-only solution,\u201d Schulze says. \u201cWe only benefit if other brands use it.\u201d</p>"

But technology failures and slow data transmission speeds lead to delays in response time, Merchant says. The increase in global flooding has intensified the need for more accurate and reliable methods.</p><p>Last year Merchant built what she says is a more effective way to track and collect data during floods: a small, inexpensive, standardized <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-small-satellites-are-providing-lowcost-access-to-space\" target=\"_self\">CubeSat</a> integrated with artificial intelligence.

The computer contains a machine learning algorithm\u2014written by Merchant using <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>\u2014that analyzes collected images to detect flooding.</p><p>The CubeSat takes a high-definition image of its surroundings every 2 minutes and transmits it to the laptop. The satellite transfers up to 1,500 images daily and stores them on a 16-gigabyte SD card.</p><p>The algorithm then analyzes patterns, including changes in the water\u2019s color and the image\u2019s pixel density. When the algorithm detects flooding, the device can alert emergency responders.</p><p>\u201cWhile many existing systems operate on multihour cycles, the CubeSat captures high-resolution images every 2 minutes,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cThe system can then trigger alerts that are delivered to first responders via SMS or email.\u201d</p><p>To test their system, Merchant and her team built a city model made of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwjL4_HW0cCRAxVrFq0GHXarIIMYACICCAEQDhoCcHY&amp;ae=2&amp;aspm=1&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgP_JBhD-ARIsANpEMxx_LTL2CYrt6MTNaTw8Uwg0GXh7c1ESvihyfeHZMrOlMY-05m2894waAtkUEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASZeRoZ0DibY4mwrXyIZ1uxKoD7jIr24jiM5BXPzI3uaV74Qppa7itfAyzOgipLKIx5Qre6poFdsa6658iv-4JqoGP5zQeasw2KoooZKxekagaKwFB4W4GxHUIEnPPoc4Xxq700XtH&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_35&amp;sig=AOD64_1PXiPwo6s4gyW40AvBebKK-dGkDw&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjiqOjW0cCRAxWMMDQIHdG9DwgQ0Qx6BAgPEAE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lego</a> blocks in an empty bathtub.

The CubeSat successfully transferred the images to the laptop, and the algorithm detected the flooding.</p><p>Out of 30 teams, the Satellite Sentinels placed third.</p><h2>Continuing her work at Accenture</h2><p>Merchant is continuing her research on flood-prevention technologies at <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a> in Richmond, Va., where she works remotely as a payload owner and designer for the company\u2019s CubeSat launch team.</p><p>After the MIT program ended, Merchant decided to scale her project. She reached out to her former mentor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hudson-space\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Hudson</a>, the global technical lead in space cybersecurity at Accenture. He offered her an internship.</p><p>Merchant is working to make the transition from prototype to functional product but, she says, needs to overcome obstacles she encountered with her MIT project.</p><p>The main one was that the model struggled to detect flooding in variable conditions. It\u2019s because the CNN model needs context, she says. Without it, the model can misinterpret complex visual cues. To fix the issue, Merchant trained the algorithm to spot flooding by identifying colors in individual pixels.</p><p>Transmitting images using Bluetooth worked in her bathroom, but it isn\u2019t quite as useful when CubeSats are orbiting 700 kilometers above the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve used a Bluetooth headset before, you know it disconnects the moment you walk away from the device it\u2019s connected to,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to work when the CubeSat constellation is in orbit.\u201d</p><p>She suggested the Accenture team switch to SubMiniature Version A (SMA) antennas. The RF antennas connect to the CubeSats using an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SMA connector</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe development process has been one of the most formative experiences of my career so far,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cWorking through the payload design and validation and meeting with these teams has given me so much experience, especially for my age.\u201d</p><p>Her payload is expected to be launched early next year.</p><h2>An aerospace internship at MIT</h2><p>Merchant is an intern at the MIT <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/node/2873\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school\u2019s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups.

It turned engineering from a dream to reality.\u201d</p><p>In that role, Merchant is focusing on cognitive cartography, a method for structuring complex information into semantic maps that reveal how ideas and concepts relate to one another. She uses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U1S0WSsPuE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embedding models</a>, a type of machine learning that converts information into numerical representations.

She was working on a robotic arm that could pick up items using an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/brain-waves-control-a-robot\" target=\"_self\">electroencephalogram</a> and Bluetooth. The project was inspired by her grandmother, who suffers from mobility issues and was wheelchair-bound.</p><p>\u201cI kept seeing IEEE mentioned in every regulation and standard I found,\u201d Merchant says. When she learned about an upcoming Orlando Section meeting, she asked her mother to take her.</p><p>At the meeting, several members presented their research.

But behind the scenes, this pioneering eVTOL developer\u2014which has received more than US $3 billion in total funding, including<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/toyota-to-invest-500-million-in-joby-aviation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> around $900 million from Toyota</a>\u2014was playing a major role in shaping Uber\u2019s vision. It later stepped in to keep that vision alive,<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-aviation-welcomes-new-75m-investment-from-uber-as-it-acquires-uber-elevate-and-expands-partnership/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> acquiring the Elevate program</a> in 2020 after Uber CEO<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Khosrowshahi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Dara Khosrowshahi</a> decided to axe it.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"joby\">Now, Joby, which was founded in 2009 and has become the dominant eVTOL startup, says it is finally on the verge of making \u201curban air mobility\u201d a reality. It plans to conduct its first passenger flights in 2026 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>\u201cDubai continues to be our global launchpad for commercial service, and our progress here is a testament to the UAE\u2019s visionary approach to advanced air mobility,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/antokho/?originalSubdomain=ae\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Anthony Khoury</a>, Joby\u2019s UAE general manager, in an email interview. \u201cDubai is on track to be the first city in the world to offer a fully integrated, premium air taxi network, and we are sprinting toward that target.\u201d</p><h2>Joby Struck a Six-Year Exclusive Deal with Dubai</h2><p>The company first <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-to-launch-air-taxi-service-uae/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced its UAE plans</a> at the World Governments Summit in Dubai in February 2024, striking a deal with Dubai\u2019s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that gives it an exclusive right to operate air taxis there for six years from the launch of commercial operations.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Joby\u2019s exclusive Dubai deal will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis </span></p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"agreement\">Joby also signed an agreement with U.K.-based<a href=\"https://skyports.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> Skyports</a> to design, build, and operate four \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-2661135407\" target=\"_blank\">vertiport</a>\u201d sites in Dubai\u2014places for the eVTOL aircraft to load and unload passengers and charge their batteries. The first vertiport will be near Dubai International Airport, with additional ones planned for Dubai Mall, the Atlantis the Royal resort, and American University in Dubai.</p><p>Joby won\u2019t be the first eVTOL developer to carry passengers. That distinction goes to China\u2019s EHang, which is already conducting limited sightseeing and<a href=\"https://www.ehang.com/news/1275.html\" target=\"_blank\"> demonstration flights</a> with its two-seat, autonomous electric multicopters. (Joby\u2019s aircraft are piloted.) If Joby pulls off its goal, however, it will be the first to routinely fly passengers from point to point over urban traffic, in keeping with Uber Elevate\u2019s original vision. Its exclusive agreement in Dubai will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis, which includes a handful of other Western eVTOL developers, plus a growing number of Chinese players. Besides its Dubai deal, Joby also has a partnership with Delta to start an airport shuttle service in the United States.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A futuristic-looking electric rotorcraft is seen flying in a blue sky.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b31d3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-futuristic-looking-electric-rotorcraft-is-seen-flying-in-a-blue-sky.jpg?id=62599883&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Joby S4 electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft has six electric motors, each weighing 28 kilograms and capable of a peak output of 236 kilowatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joby Aviation</small></p><p>Operating a reliable air taxi service is a demanding proposition that will require Joby\u2019s aircraft, charging infrastructure, and scheduling software to perform safely and reliably day in and day out. Since every new and complex technology has teething problems, Joby envisions fairly limited initial operations in 2026.</p><p>\u201cWe will transition from test flights to more complex proving runs and eventually nonpaying passenger flights out of the completed vertiports, ensuring a seamless passenger experience ahead of full commercial launch,\u201d says Khoury. He adds that Joby is currently working with Skyports to ready its initial vertiports and with government agencies in Dubai and the UAE to receive the necessary approvals for its operations.</p><p>\u201cDubai\u2019s approach is deeper and more comprehensive than what you see in many of the headlines,\u201d said Clint Harper, an aviation infrastructure and policy advisor who recently participated in an advanced air mobility workshop with Dubai\u2019s RTA. \u201cIn our workshop,\u201d he says, \u201cthe RTA staff had fantastic questions and concerns regarding safety, security, and system-level integration. Everyone recognized and appreciated strong government support and wanted to deliver the right system solution, not just a one-off demo. I was thoroughly impressed and inspired.\u201d</p><h2>Initial Air Operations Will Precede an Airworthiness Certificate</h2><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"groundwork\">Notably, all of this groundwork is taking place in advance of Joby receiving an initial type certificate for its aircraft from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In the United States (and elsewhere), a type certificate is typically a prerequisite for conducting commercial operations with paying passengers. Joby claims it\u2019s making good progress toward FAA certification, but how quickly (or slowly) that process moves is largely out of its hands. In recent years, the FAA has been taking longer to certify even conventional airplanes and helicopters, which the industry blames on staffing shortages at the agency and more cautious decision-making in the wake of the<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/boeing-plea-737-max-crashes-b34daa014406657e720bec4a990dccf6\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing 737 Max crisis</a>.</p><p>This perception that certification delays have more to do with bureaucracy than safety may be why Dubai is willing to approve some early operations by Joby in advance of FAA type certification. Interestingly, the United States is now following the UAE\u2019s example. In September, the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation began soliciting proposals for an<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-new-plan-fast-track-advanced-air\" target=\"_blank\"> eVTOL Integration Pilot Program</a> (eIPP), which will select at least five projects to demonstrate eVTOL operations in the national airspace starting as early as summer 2026.</p><p>The FAA has<a href=\"https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-policy/trump-executive-order-drones-will-shape-us-evtol-roll-out/\" target=\"_blank\"> stated</a> that the eIPP won\u2019t allow eVTOL developers to bypass certification requirements or carry paying passengers. However, it will enable them to undertake additional testing and demonstration flights as a stepping-stone to commercial operations. Joby says it\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-plans-to-jumpstart-us-operations-through-eipp/\" target=\"_blank\"> planning to take part</a> in the eIPP, meaning its air taxis could also be flying over U.S. cities in 2026\u2014even if the only person on board is the pilot.</p>"

But following a string of reversals and environmental mishaps, the facilities began going into a decline in the 1990s and 2000s. At the same time, Chinese producers, which were much less confined by environmental regulations, <a href=\"https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-rare-earth-elements-dominance-in-global-supply-chains/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">began their astonishingly rapid ascendence</a>.</p><p>Today, China controls <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/china-s-share-in-rare-earth-magnet-production-2024\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">between about 85 and 99 percent</a> of the global market for key rare earth oxides and metals, on which huge and vital tech-based industries depend. The United States and its allies find themselves at China\u2019s mercy for certain rare earths, including ones that are essential for motors, semiconductors, electroluminescent compounds, optoelectronics, and catalysis. They\u2019re in critical components of countless military systems, such as ones in aircraft, submarines, weapons, and night-vision gear.</p><p>For these reasons, the resumption of mass production of rare earths at Mountain Pass, which was greatly <a href=\"https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scaled up during 2025</a>, was a major development in geopolitics. The total output of the mine and its associated processing facilities, where the rare earth ore is turned into industrially useful oxides, <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-30-years-of-rare-earth-production-by-country/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">is small</a>, however, compared to China\u2019s output.</p><p>The Trump administration invested a lot of time during 2025 trying to set up deals to establish rare-earth supply chains that do not depend on China. This effort <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/canada-may-be-united-states-best-hope-minerals-security\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">started puzzlingly</a>, with some high-profile arm twisting of Ukraine, whose deposits are dismissed by mining experts. And also with overtures about annexing Greenland, a district of Denmark whose rare-earth deposits are enormous but, like Ukraine\u2019s, are not attractive from a mining standpoint.

But rather than a single dominant standard that could power all variety of mesh networks, three separate but interoperable technologies are instead reaching maturity more or less simultaneously: <a href=\"https://www.threadgroup.org/Portals/0/Documents/Thread_1.4_Features_White_Paper_September_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Thread 1.4</a>, a mesh standard for low-power smart-home devices; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_7\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi 7</a> standard for high-bandwidth computing; and the smart-home protocol <a href=\"https://developers.home.google.com/matter/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Matter,</a> which acts as a translator, so devices on different mesh networks can talk to one another. Together, these three provide the beginnings of compatibility and interoperability that has eluded mesh proponents for so long.</p><p>However, this multistandard compromise may well only be a way station. \u201cI expect that one mesh technology will eat all the others eventually, possibly incorporating them,\u201d said <a href=\"https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/mlsichit/\" target=\"_blank\">Mihail Sichitiu</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://ece.ncsu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">electrical and computer engineering</a> at North Carolina State University, in Raleigh. \u201cMaybe not immediately, but eventually. Looking at how other things evolved, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p><h2>Does Thread 1.4 Solve Mesh?<br /></h2><p>A mesh network is different from a conventional wireless network created by a regular <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wi-fi-7-stomps-on-the-gas\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi router</a>. Every device in a mesh network can relay messages to every other device, like rugby players passing a ball. When you add more devices, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking\" target=\"_blank\">the mesh gets stronger</a>\u2014and if one device fails, the other devices self-configure a new mesh to work around the failure.</p><p>The story of mesh networks in 2026 begins with Thread 1.4. In 2014, a coalition led by Arm, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest\" target=\"_blank\">Nest Labs</a>, and Samsung launched the <a href=\"https://www.threadgroup.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Thread group</a> to promote a commercialized and ultimately <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2016/05/30/openthread-a-solution-to-the-wifi-of-things/\" target=\"_blank\">open-source</a> mesh standard. The coalition expanded from there, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/06/apple-the-thread-group/\" target=\"_blank\">soon welcoming Apple and Amazon</a> into the ranks.</p><p>But there was a catch. Each Thread network worked only with devices from the same brand. A Google mesh network would connect only with other Google devices. Same with Amazon, same with Apple. And this was a highly inconvenient stumbling block for mesh networking that held true up to and including <a href=\"https://www.threadgroup.org/Portals/0/documents/support/Thread1.3.0WhitePaper_07192022_3990_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Thread 1.3</a>, released in 2022.</p><p>However, starting on 1 January 2026, Thread 1.4 becomes the alliance\u2019s only certified standard. Using Thread 1.4, now the only supported version of Thread, all devices can join a single mesh, regardless of whether they\u2019re made by Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, or any other device maker in the Thread consortium.</p><p>Thread 1.4 addresses much of the smart-home mesh fragmentation problem by letting devices from different manufacturers securely join the same mesh network\u2014a capability called <a href=\"https://www.matteralpha.com/news/smartthings-hubs-upgrade-to-thread-1-4-with-credential-sharing-feature\" target=\"_blank\">credential sharing</a>.</p><p>Once these credentials are shared, devices from different ecosystems can finally work together on one mesh network. That <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo_Show\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Echo Show</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePod_Mini\" target=\"_blank\">Apple HomePod mini</a> in the same house? They\u2019ll now both be able to control the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoleaf\" target=\"_blank\">Nanoleaf</a> lightbulb\u2014which could settle the age-old question of whether \u201cHey Siri!\u201d or \u201cAlexa!\u201d gets there first.</p><p>\u201cThread 1.4 is a pretty big push toward avoiding the walled garden,\u201d said <a href=\"https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/aaron-d-striegel/\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Striegel</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://engineering.nd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">computer science and engineering</a> at the University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. \u201cIt is hard to have a crystal ball to look ahead to 2026, but the pieces are in place for improved interoperability.\u201d</p><h2>Is Mesh Like TCP/IP?<br /></h2><p>Mesh has been a difficult and longstanding problem because of the crowded competitive landscape, not unlike <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Wars\" target=\"_blank\">the early days of the internet</a>. However, fewer commercial interests during the proto-internet years meant a quicker and simpler route to the eventual <a href=\"https://tcpip.training/history-of-tcp-ip/\" target=\"_blank\">TCP/IP consensus</a>. Today, by contrast, all the big players want a stake in mesh, and all have prioritized different problems and solutions.</p><p>There\u2019s a second reason, says <a href=\"https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/myung-lee\" target=\"_blank\">Myung Lee</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/eleceng\" target=\"_blank\">electrical and computer engineering</a> at the City College of New York. \u201cThe need for global interoperability drove the TCP/IP empire, but mesh networks largely occupy the edge,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIn the edge, the requirements are diverse.\u201d</p><p>That diversity became clear to Lee over a decade of chairing IEEE standards groups on short-range wireless communications. No single standard could optimize for both ultralow power and high speed, so the IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ieee802.org/15/\" target=\"_blank\">802.15 working group</a> developed separate tracks for different use cases\u2014some for devices that needed to last years on a battery, others for devices that needed to move data fast. That patchwork of specialized standards has shaped the smart-home landscape ever since.</p><p>One kind of mesh, Lee says, they developed for high-speed data transfers between devices that demand more power\u2014think laptops, smartphones, and plugged-in smart-home hubs. The other they tailored for slow, occasional data exchanges involving only tiny power budgets\u2014devices such as door sensors, leak detectors, and environmental monitors that might need to last months or years between charges.</p><p>\u201cThat split alone illustrates why a single mesh standard is difficult,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBecause edge applications simply do not share a common set of constraints.\u201d</p><p>Something similar is happening in 2026. Thread is now poised to handle smart-home devices and always-on sensors. But homes also need ultrafast Wi-Fi for laptops and phones and streaming video. That\u2019s where Wi-Fi 7 mesh comes in. And because these two mesh networks speak entirely different languages, a Matter translation layer is still needed between the two. Both <a href=\"https://www.delloro.com/news/wi-fi-7-to-drive-double-digit-enterprise-wlan-growth-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi 7</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)#Versions\" target=\"_blank\">Matter</a> (in their most stable and interoperable versions) arrived en masse in products hitting store shelves in 2025. This is the year they\u2019re all finally ready to work together.</p><p>So mesh success, in 2026, looks less like victory and more like invisibility.</p><p>Consider a user opening up an app on their phone, and over their Wi-Fi mesh connection, tapping a button to unlock a smart door lock inside their home using Thread. If this sequence just works, with no setup headaches or incompatibility warnings, without the user ever needing to know whether Wi-Fi 7 or Thread 1.4 ultimately relayed the message that unlocked the door, then the convergence was successful.</p><p>The technologies themselves haven\u2019t transitioned into a single, unified mesh standard. But they will have at least stopped getting in each other\u2019s way. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

They called their team <a href=\"https://crossfire.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossfire</a>. Their guests were a handful of officials from the <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/\" target=\"_blank\">XPrize Foundation</a>, which has organized a pair of competitions to vastly speed up <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/competitions/wildfire\" target=\"_blank\">wildfire detection and suppression</a>. Twelve other teams are competing with Crossfire in the semifinals for the autonomous wildfire-suppression track of the competition. In the final round, to be held in June 2026, five of those teams will have to find a fire within 1,000 square kilometers of what XPrize calls \u201cenvironmentally challenging\u201d terrain and then navigate to and extinguish it, all within 10 minutes. The winner collects a US $3.5 million purse\u2014and, hopefully, the world\u2019s wildfire-fighting armies get a powerful new weapon for their arsenals.</p><h2>The Wildfire Problem<br /></h2><p>Wildfires are growing more severe and affecting more people worldwide. The November 2018 Camp Fire that burned down 620 square kilometers of Northern California, including most of the town of Paradise, was the most deadly and destructive in the state\u2019s recorded history, and it sent <a href=\"https://www.pge.com/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Gas and Electric</a>, the giant utility <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article230445554.html\" target=\"_blank\">responsible</a> for starting <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-an-australian-state-faced-devastation-from-gridsparked-wildfires\" target=\"_self\">the fire</a>, into bankruptcy. XPrize had long been based in the Los Angeles area, so that catastrophe was undoubtedly on the minds of its staffers when they formulated the competition in 2019. \u201cThis was just something that was really personal and close to a lot of the individuals at the organization,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/people/andrea-santy\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Santy</a>, program director for the wildfire competition. XPrize eventually organized a separate track of the competition to award $3.5 million for detecting small fires with satellites.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman in a blue jacket and red hat seen from behind.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3f6e3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-in-a-blue-jacket-and-red-hat-seen-from-behind.jpg?id=62599503&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Andrea Santy, one of the program managers from XPrize in charge of the wildfire competition, looks on during Crossfire\u2019s trials.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>Santy says XPrize\u2019s competition designers met with more than 100 experts in the field, including fire scientists, agency officials, and technologists\u2014\u201call the experts that you would want at the table were at the table.\u201d Where their views aligned, Santy says, XPrize researchers detected the \u201ccore problems.\u201d One of the most important was response time. In the best case, an hour can often pass between when a fire is first detected and when it\u2019s extinguished. XPrize aims to shrink that drastically. An additional $1 million will go to the teams that (per the rules) \u201csuccessfully demonstrate accurate, precise, and rapid detection.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://fpe.umd.edu/clark/faculty/601/Arnaud-Trouv%C3%A9\" target=\"_blank\">Arnaud Trouv\u00e9</a>, chair of the UMD\u2019s Fire Protection Engineering department, thinks even the 10-minute limit may not be good enough. \u201cOn a <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mqt/redflagtips\" target=\"_blank\">red flag</a> day with high-wind conditions, a fire that starts is going to be taking a big size within a matter of tens of seconds,\u201d he said as we waited for the Alta X to try again. \u201cSo even the 10 minutes you have to go do something will be too slow.\u201d Whatever comes from the XPrize, he says, will be adopted, but more likely in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00141-z\" target=\"_blank\">developed areas</a>, where fires spread more slowly and could be extinguished early on, when firefighters are often busy evacuating residents.</p><p>In any event, the time limit pointed most teams\u2014and all the teams to make the semifinals\u2014toward drones. Firefighters have worked, or tried to work, given bureaucratic and other hurdles, with drones for years, but mainly for reconnaissance, says <a href=\"https://wfca.com/staff/bob-roper/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Roper</a>, a senior wildfire advisor for the <a href=\"https://wfca.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Western Fire Chiefs Association</a>. Many of the hurdles around using drones have been cleared, but no drone exists yet that can carry enough suppressant to be useful on its own, says Roper. (The <a href=\"https://www.helicopterexpress.com/blog/how-much-water-can-a-helicopter-carry#:~:text=The%20standard%20Bambi%20Bucket%2C%20the,2%2C600%20gallons%20(9%2C840%20liters).&amp;text=The%20Bambi%20MAX%20Bucket%20developed,US%20gallons%20(9%2C800%20liters).&amp;text=Bambi%20Torrentula%20Bucket%2C%20introduced%20in,flexible%20and%20efficient%20firefighting%20operations\" target=\"_blank\">smallest helicopter bucket</a> carries 270 liters.) Roper says government-funded fire agencies seldom \u201chave available unrestricted dollars to be able to develop something that\u2019s new.\u201d By sprinkling startups and universities with research funding, the XPrize is poised to make, he says, \u201ca quantum leap difference.\u201d</p><h2>Team Crossfire </h2><p>Word of the XPrize wildfire competition reached Trouv\u00e9\u2019s desk soon after it launched in April 2023.

Now both camera feeds indicated a blaze in the same place, and the monitor threw up a warning in red: \u201cFIRE DETECTED.\u201d As turkey vultures looked on from high above, the drone identified the fire again from a higher altitude, then with the cameras pointed at a different angle, it finally flew a preprogrammed back-and-forth route through the air that looks like a lawnmower\u2019s path.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"People surround a white pickup truck that has it\\u2019s front hood open in the top image.

This was designed by Alvarez, who happens to have a Ph.D. in biophysics, using an even newer version of image-reading AI developed just last year.</p><p>All of the teams, Santy says, have proposed something broadly similar: sensors and cameras on the ground or on one or more drones, or both, and AI interpreting the data. How teams get to the fire has been driven by regulation\u2014the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap11_section_3.html\" target=\"_blank\">FAA has restrictions on drones weighing more than</a> 25 kilograms (55 pounds), as well as autonomous systems dropping payloads, which is why Rivas had to pilot the Alta X. \u201cSome are looking at how we can address the problem within the current regulations, so they\u2019re trying to stay within the 55 pounds,\u201d says Santy. Others are designing systems that ultimately could be deployed only under new regulations. That primarily comes down to either using a swarm of smaller drones or one heavy-lift drone. Teams that fly heavy in the finals will have to get FAA approval for the contest, just as Crossfire would need it to operate the Alta X autonomously.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A black quadcopter drone flies with a red balloon beneath it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b225c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-quadcopter-drone-flies-with-a-red-balloon-beneath-it.jpg?id=62601815&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Crossfire\u2019s fire-suppression drone flies toward a fire carrying a balloon full of water. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>Curiously, the XPrize appears not to have spurred much innovation in actually putting out a fire. Most teams are using water, though they\u2019re dropping it in a variety of different ways. It\u2019s a work in progress, says Santy. \u201cTeams have been thinking very hard about what works under challenging conditions\u201d like wind, drone movement, and proximity to the fire.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman sits behind a large drone.

Typically, aircraft flying at high altitude release a lot of water, which, says Trouv\u00e9, mostly misses the burning biomass. \u201cReleasing the water at low elevations and directly above the burning biomass requires much less water,\u201d he says.</p><p>With a new balloon installed on the Alta X, the team attempted to attack the fire a second time. This time, Rivas spent several minutes maneuvering the drone to get it in place before dropping the balloon, which appeared to partially detonate, spewing water as it fell. The balloon didn\u2019t completely burst until it hit the platform, spraying water all over and creating a huge puff of steam. But when the smoke cleared, the fire still burned. Crossfire\u2019s detonators, it turned out, were rated for warmer weather than this October day. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested this probably 20 different times, and 20 different times it\u2019s been successful,\u201d Alvarez said ruefully.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Crossfire\u2019s drone carries a water balloon skyward, finds the fire, and drops the balloon.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>But the third attempt, several hours later, was the charm. Rivas whisked the Alta X over the fire. Taha, on the other side of the fire, checked its position and motioned for release.

Along with Taha, aerospace engineering professor <a href=\"https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/58/Derek-A-Paley\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Paley</a> has talked to some 40 potential customers\u2014mainly fire departments and government agencies\u2014for the system Crossfire is developing. He\u2019s currently uncertain whether there are enough organizations willing to adopt the technology to make it commercially viable. So far, he says, \u201cit\u2019s a little bit of an uphill battle, but we\u2019re hoping with the visibility brought to the problem by XPrize\u201d and the momentum of being a finalist\u2014and, better still, some prize money in hand\u2014\u201cwe\u2019ll have enough to have a compelling business model.\u201d</p><p>Roper, of the Western Fire Chiefs Association, acknowledges that \u201cpolitical considerations\u201d around existing fleets of crewed aircraft will challenge the transition to drones, but he says that these can gain a foothold by operating when and where crewed aircraft can\u2019t, at night, for example. Still, it will take multiple companies commercializing the technology to prod fire departments to purchase drones. Even then, he says, \u201cit\u2019s probably going to have to be adopted either at the federal or the state level first and then there\u2019s a trickle-down effect to the local fire departments.\u201d</p><p>If not, Paley says, \u201cour tech is applicable to law enforcement, and other aspects of public safety.

Before joining CMU, Elenberg spent 28 years as an army and U.S. Public Health Service nurse, which included 19 deployments and serving as the principal strategist for incident response at the Pentagon.</p><p>The final event of the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/darpa-triage-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA Triage Challenge</a> will take place in November, and <a href=\"https://teamchiron.ai/tabs/team/team.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Team Chiron</a> from <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Mellon University</a> will be competing, using a squad of quadruped robots and drones. The team is led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-elenberg-0b52a595\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kimberly Elenberg</a>, whose 28-year career as an army and <a href=\"https://www.usphs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Public Health Service</a> nurse took her from combat surgical teams to incident response strategy at the Pentagon.</p><p><strong>Why do we need robots for triage?</strong></p><p><strong>Kimberly Elenberg:</strong> We simply do not have enough responders for mass-casualty incidents. The drones and ground robots that we\u2019re developing can give us the perspective that we need to identify where people are, assess who\u2019s most at risk, and figure out how responders can get to them most efficiently.</p><p><strong>When could you have used robots like these?</strong></p><p><strong>Elenberg: </strong>On the way to one of the challenge events, there was a four-car accident on a back road. For me on my own, that was a mass casualty event. I could hear some people yelling and see others walking around, and so I was able to reason that those people could breathe and move.</p><p>In the fourth car, I had to crawl inside to reach a gentleman who was slumped over with an occluded airway. I was able to lift his head until I could hear him breathing. I could see that he was hemorrhaging and feel that he was going into shock because his skin was cold. A robot couldn\u2019t have gotten inside of the car to make those assessments.</p><p>This challenge involves enabling robots to remotely collect this data\u2014can they detect heart rate from changes in skin color or hear breathing from a distance? If I\u2019d had these capabilities, it would have helped me identify the person at greatest risk and gotten to them first.</p><p><strong>How do you design tech for triage?</strong></p><p><strong>Elenberg: </strong>The system has to be simple. For example, I can\u2019t have a device that\u2019s going to force a medic to take their hands away from their patient. What we came up with is a vest-mounted Android phone that flips down at chest height to display a map that has the GPS location of all of the casualties on it and their triage priority as colored dots, autonomously populated from the team of robots.</p><p><strong>Are the robots living up to the hype?</strong></p><p><strong>Elenberg: </strong>From my time in service, I know the only way to understand true capability is to build it, test it, and break it.

Do you feel you lack the necessary hands-on technical skills to secure a job? Maybe you\u2019ve thought of an engineering solution for a problem in your school or community but are unsure how to take the next step.</p><p>I struggled to bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world application. But when you combine academic knowledge with practical projects that solve a societal problem with technology, you can ace any interview.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to navigate the journey alone. Here are some lessons I learned as a student.</p><h2>Speeding up checkout lines and accounting processes</h2><p>I\u2019m a cloud support engineer at a company in Hyderabad, India. I\u2019m also an active IEEE volunteer as one of its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/young-professionals\" target=\"_self\">young professionals</a>, an <a href=\"https://transmitter.ieee.org/impact-creators/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">impact creator</a>, and a <a href=\"https://brand-experience.ieee.org/are-you-committed-to-being-an-ieee-brand-ambassador/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brand ambassador</a>.</p><p>In my role as impact creator, I share my insights on engineering, computing, and technology with the news media to highlight trends and consumer habits. As a brand ambassador, I educate students and professionals on how to display IEEE branding on websites, newsletters, banners, event materials, and other items.</p><p>When I was in my first semester as a computer engineering student at <a href=\"https://ipu.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University</a>, in New Delhi, I became frustrated by the long lines to check books in and out of the library of the affiliated college, the <a href=\"https://hmritm.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HMR Institute of Technology and Management</a>. Even getting a new library card took a long time. I was determined to solve the problem.</p><p>For six months, I singlehandedly developed a software program to scan student ID cards and speed up the processes. I received the school\u2019s first Technocrat Award for my efforts.</p><p>Word got out about my programming skills, and I received many requests to help solve other problems. An intriguing one was from the director of India\u2019s largest national broadcasting company, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">All India Radio</a>. I was asked to streamline its accounting process. At the time, the company used only <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Excel</a> along with a pen-and-paper system. It took me just six months to build a full-stack accounting software program to make the process significantly more efficient.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhen you combine academic knowledge with practical projects that solve a societal problem with technology, you can ace any interview.\u201d</p><p>That opportunity was a big break for me. The technology I created redefined the broadcaster\u2019s operations and could be used in its other offices, expanding my reach.</p><p>In my first corporate job interview after graduating from university, the interviewer was surprised to learn that I\u2019d published 15 <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SUKsG2AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\" target=\"_blank\">research papers</a>, completed 15 <a href=\"https://github.com/Ramneek-kalra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">projects</a>, and even had a pending patent application. (The government has since granted the patent.)</p><p>The human resources representative and the technical-round interviewer weren\u2019t expecting a recent graduate to have research published, and they were impressed. I was excited to see their reactions.</p><p>Students need to understand the importance of doing something exceptional beyond learning theory and concepts. Having practical skills before leaving school is a great way to set yourself apart from other new engineering graduates.</p><h2>Ask the right questions</h2><p>Before taking on any new projects, I ask myself five simple questions. They might seem obvious, but some of the details are often forgotten. Even as a student, when you start working with clients, you must have a process for gathering the information you need.</p><p>When it comes to getting the correct information, I focus on the five W\u2019s: who, what, why, when, and where.</p><ul><li><strong>Who</strong> uses the current model?</li><li><strong>What </strong>are its features?</li><li><strong>Why </strong>is the current model insufficient?</li><li><strong>When </strong>is the right time to deploy the new solution?</li><li><strong>Where </strong>should it be deployed?</li></ul><p>Once I get those answers, I begin using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">design thinking</a> to strategize.</p><p>My clients generally are looking to improve existing solutions rather than starting from scratch. I must know what is and isn\u2019t working with the current program.</p><p>Remember that although the process might be easy for you, it might be new for your client.</p><p>Here are what I consider to be the five stages of the process.</p><p><strong>Understand the problem.</strong> Once you identify the client\u2019s issue, the next step is to listen to the client in full without making judgments. You need to really understand the pain points and why the current application isn\u2019t working. Listen fully, ask questions, and try to empathize with the client\u2019s issues.</p><p><strong>Research and ideation.</strong> Do your own research. It\u2019s essential to conduct field research to better understand the client\u2019s requirements. One of my projects was to help farmers secure loans directly from the Indian government, rather than go through loan service agencies and banks. The farmers were frustrated over how long it took to get loans. While doing my research, I was shocked by the high fees the agencies charged to process the necessary paperwork.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have learned about that from just reading research papers. You have to explore your client\u2019s pain points.</p><p>Next, start brainstorming.<strong> </strong>Consider how you can improve the current model. Maybe you should conduct research to find other products that might solve the problem. Also consider redesigning the current version. Let yourself think of as many ideas as possible, then review them with your client and request feedback.</p><p>That can give you a clear idea of what the client likes about the options, and it can help you better direct the rest of your research and ideation.</p><p><strong>Technology research and prototyping.</strong> By this stage, you\u2019ve created a short list of ideas to address your client\u2019s pain points. Next, research all the technologies you need to use. If you need training, use learning platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Coursera</a>, <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EdX</a>, the <a href=\"https://iln.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Learning Network</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Udacity</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Udemy</a>.</p><p>Once you identify and learn the technology needed, it\u2019s time to create the first prototype.</p><p><strong>Test and improve.</strong> Test the prototype, gather feedback from your client while you take meticulous notes, and then revise it according to the feedback.</p><p>That helps you understand what improvements are needed and helps identify gaps in your model. It gets you closer to the client\u2019s requirements. Use the information to refine the design and build the product.</p><p>It is important to note that this stage might go through multiple iterations. You might have to continue to improve the results until the design works for the client. Refer back often to your original notes on the pain points to ensure you haven\u2019t forgotten anything in the final design.</p><p><strong>Protect your intellectual property. </strong>Many students and young professionals skip the important step of safeguarding their idea such as copyrighting it, publishing a paper, or filing a patent. I have seen many students who present their ideas at hackathons and competitions and assume that receiving cash prizes is enough to list on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9. They really should protect their ideas.</p><h2>Get involved with IEEE</h2><p>After speaking at more than 1,000 IEEE workshops and other events in more than 25 countries, I\u2019m concerned that students aren\u2019t using their technical knowledge to its fullest potential. To learn more about how to use your time and skills as a new engineer, view my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ramneekkalra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>Don\u2019t wait for an opportunity to knock on your door. Create your own opportunities by participating in <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/conferences-events\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE technical and nontechnical events</a> and getting involved with the organization\u2019s student service-learning program, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-student-projects\" target=\"_self\">EPICS in IEEE</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pvn-model-three-buzzwords-ieee-ramneek-d-kalra/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">participation, volunteering, and networking (PVN) model of IEEE</a>\u2014which I coined\u2014works.</p>"

The goal is to lock in the benefits without the high costs, weekly jabs, or lingering side effects. And in 2026, the first company to develop such a device is likely to seek clearance to bring it to patients.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new therapeutic area,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.fractyl.com/team/harith-rajagopalan-md-phd/\" target=\"_blank\">Harith Rajagopalan</a>, cofounder and chief executive of that company, <a href=\"https://www.fractyl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fractyl Health</a>, based in Burlington, Mass.</p><h2>Resetting Metabolism for Lasting Weight Loss </h2><p>You can think of these systems as a middle ground between drugs and bariatric surgery. The endoscope is a slim, flexible tube equipped with a camera and a guidewire that leads a catheter into the digestive system. Doctors send the tools down the throat so they can view and modify the intestines from the inside\u2014remodeling gut tissue and recalibrating its response to food without a single incision. The procedure takes about an hour or so, and patients typically go home the same day.</p><p>To understand how the treatment works, it helps to first understand what goes wrong in the gut during years of unhealthy eating. As diets high in sugar and fat bombard the duodenum, the lining there becomes inflamed and its normal signaling pathways distorted. Mucosal cells in the tissue grow abnormally and propagate these maladaptive changes, locking in a dysfunctional pattern that drives cravings, weight gain, and insulin resistance.</p><p>The Fractyl device overcomes these entrenched changes. It works by deliberately injuring the tissue, using near-boiling water to burn off diseased cells on the intestinal lining. A natural healing process then kicks in, producing a fresh layer of healthy tissue and re-establishing proper metabolic control.</p><p>\u201cYou see regrowth at about two weeks, and it continues until the mucosa looks pretty normal,\u201d says <a href=\"https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/person/alan-d-cherrington-phd/\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Cherrington</a>, a physiologist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who consults for Fractyl.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26638897/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p><a href=\"https://ir.fractyl.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fractyl-health-announces-groundbreaking-data-remain-1-midpoint\" target=\"_blank\">Preliminary results</a> from the clinical trial that Christina joined, termed the <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06484114\" target=\"_blank\">Remain-1 study</a>, indicate that the procedure is working as intended to stabilize weight after GLP-1 therapy. Three months after stopping Zepbound, study participants who underwent the Fractyl procedure generally held their weight steady or continued to lose weight, while those who received a sham treatment saw the number on their scales climb steadily upward.</p><p>The results are \u201chonestly better than I thought they were going to be,\u201d says one of the doctors leading the trial, <a href=\"https://providers.dartmouth-health.org/2233/shelby-a-sullivan\" target=\"_blank\">Shelby Sullivan</a>, a gastroenterologist and obesity-medicine specialist at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.</p><p>Sullivan cautions against drawing firm conclusions, given the small number of participants and short follow-up so far.

Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://en.tecure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TeCure</a>, in South Korea, and <a href=\"https://aquaendoscopy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua Medical</a>, in Pleasanton, Calif., are using lasers and radiofrequency-heated water vapor, respectively, to achieve a similar remodeling of the gut lining.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s different methods to do the same thing,\u201d says <a href=\"https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13872/pichamol-jirapinyo-gastroenterology_hepatology_and_endoscopy-boston-foxborough-jamaica_plain\" target=\"_blank\">Pichamol Jirapinyo</a>, a bariatric endoscopist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a cofounder of <a href=\"https://bariendo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bariendo</a>, a network of 10 nonsurgical weight-loss clinics across the United States. While ongoing trials may clarify differences in efficacy and safety, Jirapinyo (who consults for Fractyl) expects operational features such as ease of use and procedure time to play a decisive role in determining uptake among practitioners.</p><p>Timing of market entry is critical, too\u2014and Fractyl, now leading the pack, is expected to deliver the first large-scale clinical results. Those outcomes, from the trial that Sullivan is leading, could set the tone for an entire class of new device-based obesity treatments aiming to preserve the gains of GLP-1 drugs, notes Endogenex CEO <a href=\"https://www.endogenex.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Stacey Pugh</a>. \u201cIf they are successful, it\u2019s going to blow this field wide open,\u201d she says.</p><h2>Alternative Post-GLP-1 Devices </h2><p>Not everyone is convinced that resurfacing the duodenum is the way to go. In Europe, the past year saw the arrival of a new weight-loss device called <a href=\"https://morphicmedical.com/reset/\" target=\"_blank\">Reset</a> that\u2014while not explicitly authorized for use in a post-GLP-1 drug setting\u2014introduces a sleevelike liner to the duodenum that physically prevents contact between food and the gut wall. That device must be removed within a year, however, offering only a temporary fix.</p><p>Other endoscopic approaches target the stomach: <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sleeve-gastroplasty\" target=\"_blank\">One in common use today</a> applies sutures to fold the stomach and shrink its size, while <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016-5085(24)05349-6\" target=\"_blank\">another, more experimental method</a> burns off stomach tissue that regulates the secretion of appetite-stimulating hormones.</p><p>These stomach-directed methods may offer a logistical advantage given the relative robustness and accessibility of the stomach, explains <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-c-storm-m-d-93414431/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Storm</a>, a therapeutic endoscopist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. \u201cThe duodenum is paper thin, as compared to the stomach, which is like a thick neoprene bag,\u201d he says.</p><p>Regulatory clearance for Fractyl would allow the company to directly promote its product for post-GLP-1 weight maintenance\u2014something that <a href=\"https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Scientific</a>, maker of the <a href=\"https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-EU/medical-specialties/bariatric-endoscopy/endoscopic-sleeve-gastroplasty.html\" target=\"_blank\">most widely used stomach-suturing device</a>, is not legally permitted to do unless it engages in a new round of clinical trials. And that distinction could give duodenal therapies an edge in marketing. But Storm, who consults for Boston Scientific and has also participated in trials of the Endogenex system, raises concerns about the complexity of duodenal therapy. \u201cIt just introduces a whole other level of difficulty for the endoscopist that that I think will impact scalability,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Holding On to Hard-Won Progress </h2><p>For patients like Christina, the debate over stomach versus duodenum, or one company\u2019s device versus another\u2019s, is largely academic. What matters for her is that the 50 pounds she lost on Zepbound\u2014nearly 20 percent of her body weight\u2014has stayed off so far, a stability that she attributes to the Fractyl device. Because the trial is randomized and blinded, it is possible she actually received the sham procedure. But Christina is fairly confident that she got the real thing.</p><p>Her reasoning comes from small but telling moments, like when her husband was cooking smoked pork burnt ends, sending up the kind of rich aromas that once would have sent her straight to the table. \u201cIt smelled really good, but I didn\u2019t have any desire to chow down on it,\u201d Christina says.</p><p>Experiences like Christina\u2019s hint at the tantalizing promise of a lasting solution after drug-assisted weight loss, but medical-device development demands more than anecdotes. With pivotal trial readouts on the horizon, the year ahead could determine whether these devices remain hopeful prototypes or become validated tools in the next era of obesity care. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Scaling up, on the other hand, means jamming as many GPUs as possible into each of those computers, linking them so that they act like a single gigantic GPU, and allowing them to do bigger pieces of a problem faster.</p><p>The two domains rely on two different physical connections. Scaling out mostly relies on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-interconnects-imec-silicon-photonics\" target=\"_self\">photonic chips and optical fiber</a>, which together can sling data hundreds or thousands of meters. Scaling up, which results in networks that are roughly 10 times as dense, is the domain of much simpler and less costly technology\u2014copper cables that often span no more than a meter or two.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>But the increasingly high GPU-to-GPU data rates needed to make more powerful computers work are coming up against the physical limits of copper. As the bandwidth demands on copper cables approach the terabit-per-second realm, physics demands that they be made shorter and thicker, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-kuo-6233274/\" target=\"_blank\">David Kuo</a>, vice president of product marketing and business development at the data-center-interconnect startup <a href=\"https://point2tech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Point2 Technology</a>. That\u2019s a big problem, given the congestion inside computer racks today and the fact that Nvidia, the leading AI hardware company, <a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/03/19/nvidia-draws-gpu-system-roadmap-out-to-2028/\" target=\"_blank\">plans an eightfold increase in the maximum number of GPUs</a> per system, from 72 to 576 by 2027.</p><p>\u201cWe call it the copper cliff,\u201d says Kuo.</p><p>The industry is working on ways to unclog data centers by extending copper\u2019s reach and bringing slim, long-reaching optical fiber closer to the GPUs themselves. But Point2 and another startup, <a href=\"https://www.attotude.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AttoTude</a>, advocate for a solution that\u2019s simultaneously in between the two technologies and completely different from them. They claim the tech will deliver the low cost and reliability of copper as well as some of the narrow gauge and distance of optical\u2014a combination that will handily meet the needs of future AI systems.</p><p>Their answer? Radio.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Later this year, Point2 will begin manufacturing the chips behind a 1.6-terabit-per-second cable consisting of eight slender polymer waveguides, each capable of carrying 448 gigabits per second using two frequencies, 90 gigahertz and 225 GHz. At each end of the waveguide are plug-in modules that turn electronic bits into modulated radio waves and back again. AttoTude is planning essentially the same thing, but at terahertz frequencies and with a different kind of svelte, flexible cable.</p><p>Both companies say their technologies can easily outdo copper in reach\u2014spanning 10 to 20 meters without significant loss, which is certainly long enough to handle Nvidia\u2019s announced scale-up plans. And in Point2\u2019s case, the system consumes one-third of optical\u2019s power, costs one-third as much, and offers as little as one-thousandth the latency.</p><p>According to its proponents, radio\u2019s reliability and ease of manufacturing compared with those of optics mean that it might beat photonics in the race to bring low-energy processor-to-processor connections all the way to GPU, eliminating some copper even on the printed circuit board.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"copper\">What\u2019s wrong with copper? </h2><p>So, what\u2019s wrong with copper? Nothing, so long as the data rate isn\u2019t too high and the distance it has to go isn\u2019t too far. At high data rates, though, conductors like copper fall prey to what\u2019s called the skin effect.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Comparison of two cables: direct-attach and e-Tube. e-Tube is smaller, reaching 20 meters.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"31ae0\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/comparison-of-two-cables-direct-attach-and-e-tube-e-tube-is-smaller-reaching-20-meters.png?id=62604012&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A 1.6-terabit-per-second e-Tube cable has half the area of a 32-gauge copper cable and has up to 20 times the reach.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Point2 Technology  </small></p><p>The skin effect occurs because the signal\u2019s rapidly changing current leads to a changing magnetic field that tries to counter the current. This countering force is concentrated at the middle of the wire, so most of the current is confined to flowing at the wire\u2019s outer edge\u2014the \u201cskin\u201d\u2014which increases resistance. At 60 hertz\u2014the mains frequency in many countries\u2014most of the current is in the outer 8 millimeters of copper. But at 10 GHz, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect\" target=\"_blank\">skin is just 0.65</a> micrometers deep. So to push high-frequency data through copper, the wire needs to be wider, and you need more power. Both requirements work against packing more and more connections into a smaller space to scale up computing.</p><p>To counteract the skin effect and other signal-degrading issues, companies have developed copper cables with specialized electronics at either end. With the most promising, called <a href=\"https://credosemi.com/products/zeroflapaec/\" target=\"_blank\">active electrical cables, or AECs,</a> the terminating chip is called a <a href=\"https://w.kandou.com/matterhorn/2024-06-05-what-is-a-retimer/\" target=\"_blank\">retimer</a> (pronounced \u201c<em><em>re</em></em>-timer\u201d). This IC cleans up the data signal and the clock signal as they arrive from the processor. The circuit then retransmits them down the copper cable\u2019s typically eight pairs of wires, or lanes. (There is a second set for transmitting in the other direction.) At the other end, the chip\u2019s twin takes care of any noise or clock issues that accumulate during the journey and sends the data on to the receiving processor. Thus, at the cost of electronic complexity and power consumption, an AEC can extend the distance that copper can reach.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/donbarnetson/\" target=\"_blank\">Don Barnetson</a>, senior vice president and head of product at <a href=\"https://credosemi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Credo</a>, which provides network hardware to data centers, says his company has developed an AEC that can deliver 800 Gb/s as far as 7 meters\u2014a distance that\u2019s likely needed as computers hit 500 to 600 GPUs and span multiple racks. The first use of AECs will probably be to link individual GPUs to the network switches that form the scale-out network. This first stage in the scale-out network is important, says Barnetson, because \u201cit\u2019s the only nonredundant hop in the network.\u201d Losing that link, even momentarily, can cause an AI training run to collapse.</p><p>But even if retimers manage to push the copper cliff a bit farther into the future, physics will eventually win. Point2 and AttoTude are betting that point is coming soon.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"reach\">Terahertz radio\u2019s reach </h2><p>AttoTude grew out of founder and CEO <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Welch_(optical_engineer)\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Welch</a>\u2019s deep investigations into photonics. A cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/newsroom/nokia-completes-acquisition-of-infinera-to-create-innovation-powerhouse-in-optical-networks-with-the-scale-to-power-the-data-center-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">Infinera, an optical telecom\u2013equipment maker purchased by Nokia</a> in 2025, Welch developed photonic systems for decades. He knows the technology\u2019s weaknesses well: It consumes too much power (about 10 percent of a data center\u2019s compute budget, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_self\">according to Nvidia</a>); it\u2019s extremely sensitive to temperature; getting light into and out of photonics chips requires micrometer-precision manufacturing; and the technology\u2019s lack of long-term reliability is notorious. (There\u2019s even a term for it: \u201clink flap.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cCustomers love fiber. But what they hate is the photonics,\u201d says Welch. \u201cElectronics have been demonstrated to be inherently more reliable than optics.\u201d</p><p>Fresh off Nokia\u2019s US $2.3 billion purchase of Infinera, Welch asked himself some fundamental questions as he contemplated his next startup, beginning with \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have to be at [an optical wavelength], where should I be?\u201d The answer was the highest frequency that\u2019s achievable purely with electronics\u2014the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-truth-about-terahertz\" target=\"_self\">terahertz</a> regime, 300 to 3,000 GHz.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span><span>\u201cYou start with passive copper, and you do everything you can to run in passive copper as long as you can</span><span>.</span><span>\u201d</span> <span><strong>\u2014</strong></span></span><span><strong><span>Don </span><span>Barnetson</span></strong><span><strong>, Credo</strong></span></span></p><p>So Welch and his team set about building a system that consists of a digital component to interface with the GPU, a terahertz-frequency generator, and a mixer to encode the data on the terahertz signal. An antenna then funnels the signal into a narrow, flexible waveguide.</p><p>As for the waveguide, it\u2019s made of a dielectric at the center, which channels the terahertz signal, surrounded by cladding. One early version was just a narrow, hollow copper tube. Welch says that the second-generation cable\u2014made up of fibers only about 200 \u00b5m across\u2014 points to a system with losses down to 0.3 decibels per meter\u2014a small fraction of the loss from a typical copper cable carrying 224 Gb/s.</p><p>Welch predicts this waveguide will be able to carry data as far as 20 meters. That \u201chappens to be a beautiful distance for scale-up in data centers,\u201d he says.</p><p>So far, AttoTude has made the individual components\u2014the digital data chip, the terahertz-signal generator, the circuit that mixes the two\u2014along with a couple generations of waveguides. But the company hasn\u2019t yet integrated them into a single pluggable form. Still, Welch says, the combination delivers enough bandwidth for at least 224 Gb/s transmission, and the startup demonstrated 4-meter transmission at 970 GHz last April at the <a href=\"https://www.ofcconference.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Optical Fiber Communications Conference</a>, in San Francisco.</p><h2>Radio\u2019s reach in the data center </h2><p>Point2 has been aiming to bring radio to the data center longer than AttoTude has. Formed nine years ago by <a href=\"https://point2tech.com/company/team/\" target=\"_blank\">veterans</a> of <a href=\"https://www.marvell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Marvell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a>, and <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a>, the startup has pulled in $55 million in venture funding, most notably from computer cables and connections maker <a href=\"https://www.molex.com/en-us/home\" target=\"_blank\">Molex</a>. The latter\u2019s backing \u201cis critical, because they\u2019re a major part of the cable-and-connector ecosystem,\u201d says Kuo. Molex has already shown that it can make Point2\u2019s cable without modifying its existing manufacturing lines, and now Foxconn Interconnect Technology, which makes cables and connectors, is partnering with the startup. The support could be a big selling point for the hyperscalers who would be Point2\u2019s customers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Bundles of grey cables cascade down the back of a black computer rack.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"27f16\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/bundles-of-grey-cables-cascade-down-the-back-of-a-black-computer-rack.jpg?id=62604023&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Nvidia\u2019s GB200 NVL72 rack-scale computer relies on many copper cables to link its 72 processors together.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">NVIDIA </small></p><p>Each end of the Point2 cable, called an e-Tube, consists of a single silicon chip that converts the incoming digital data into modulated millimeter-wave frequencies and an antenna that radiates into the waveguide. The waveguide itself is a plastic core with metal cladding, all wrapped in a metal shield. A 1.6-Tb/s cable, called an active radio cable (ARC), is made up of eight e-Tube cores. At 8.1 millimeters across, that cable takes up half the volume of a comparable AEC cable.</p><p>One of the benefits of operating at RF frequencies is that the chips that handle them can be made in a standard silicon foundry, says Kuo. A collaboration between engineers at Point2 and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, reported this year in the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966033\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits</em></em></a>, used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_nm_process\" target=\"_blank\">28-nanometer CMOS</a> technology, which hasn\u2019t been cutting edge since 2010.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"scaleup\">The scale-up network market </h2><p>As promising as their tech sounds, Point2 and AttoTude will have to overcome the data-center industry\u2019s long history with copper. \u201cYou start with passive copper,\u201d says Credo\u2019s Barnetson. \u201cAnd you do everything you can to run in passive copper as long as you can.\u201d</p><p>The boom in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_self\">liquid cooling for data-center computing</a> is evidence of that, he says. \u201cThe entire reason people have gone to liquid cooling is to keep [scaling up] in passive copper,\u201d Barnetson says. To connect more GPUs in a scale-up network with passive copper, they must be packed in at densities too high for air cooling alone to handle. Getting the same kind of scale-up from a more spread-out set of GPUs connected by millimeter-wave ARCs would ease the need for cooling, suggests Kuo.</p><p>Meanwhile, both startups are also chasing a version of the technology that will attach directly to the GPU.</p><p>Nvidia and Broadcom recently deployed optical transceivers that live inside the same package as a processor, separating the electronics and optics by micrometers rather than centimeters or meters. Right now, the technology is limited to the network-switch chips that connect to a scale-out network. But big players and startups alike are trying to extend its use all the way to the GPU.</p><p>Both Welch and Kuo say their companies\u2019 technologies could have a big advantage over optical tech in such a transceiver-processor package. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_self\">Nvidia and Broadcom\u2014separately\u2014had to do a mountain of engineering</a> to make their systems possible to manufacture and reliable enough to exist in the same package as a very expensive processor. One of the many challenges is how to attach an optical fiber to a waveguide on a photonic chip with micrometer accuracy. Because of its short wavelength, infrared laser light must be lined up very precisely with the core of an optical fiber, which is only around 10 \u00b5m across. By contrast, millimeter-wave and terahertz signals have a much longer wavelength, so you don\u2019t need as much precision to attach the waveguide. In one demo system it was done by hand, says Kuo.</p><p>Pluggable connections will be the technology\u2019s first use, but radio transceivers co-packaged with processors are \u201cthe real prize,\u201d says Welch. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

The person who uses AI is going to take your job.\u201d</p><p>This is an idea that has become a refrain for, among others, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has publicly made the prediction several times <a href=\"https://business.columbia.edu/insights/digital-future/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-reveals-keys-ai-and-leadership?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">since October 2023</a>. Meanwhile, other AI developers and stalwarts say the technology <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">will eliminate countless entry-level jobs</a>. These predictions have come at the same time as reports of layoffs at companies including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/technology/ibm-layoffs-ai.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, causing anxiety for tech workers\u2014especially those starting their careers, whose responsibilities are often more easily automated.</p><p>Early reports have borne out some of these anxieties in employment data. For example, entry-level hiring at the 15 biggest tech firms fell 25 percent from 2023 to 2024, according to a <a href=\"https://www.signalfire.com/blog/signalfire-state-of-talent-report-2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report from SignalFire</a> last May. Still, it\u2019s unclear what the long-term effects will be, or whether hiring cuts are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk7zg0gzvo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">actually a result of AI</a>. For instance, while Meta <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/technology/meta-plans-to-cut-600-jobs-at-ai-superintelligence-labs.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">laid off 600 employees</a> from its AI division in October (and continued hiring other AI researchers), OpenAI began <a href=\"https://openai.com/careers/emerging-talent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hiring junior software engineers</a>.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>In 2026, all new graduates may face a tougher job market in the United States. Employers\u2019 rating of the job market for college graduates is now at its most pessimistic since 2020, according to data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) <a href=\"https://www.naceweb.org/about-us/press/hiring-is-flat-for-the-college-class-of-2026\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Job Outlook 2026</em></em></a> survey. However, 49 percent of respondents still consider the job market \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good.\u201d</p><p>So, what does the rise of generative AI mean for early-career engineers?</p><p>\u201cThis is a tectonic shift,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-malan-0994191/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hugo Malan</a>, president of the <a href=\"https://set.kellyservices.us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">science, engineering, technology and telecom</a> reporting unit within the staffing agency Kelly Services. AI agents aren\u2019t poised to replace workers one-to-one, though. Instead, there will be a realignment of which jobs are needed, and what those roles look like.</p><h2>How Jobs Are Changing</h2><p>When publicly available AI tools first arrived, Malan says the expectation was that jobs like call-center roles would be most vulnerable. \u201cBut what nobody predicted was that the biggest impact by far would be on programmers,\u201d a trend he attributes to the relatively solitary and highly structured nature of the work. He notes that, while other economic conditions also factor into the job market, the pace of programmer employment decline has accelerated since generative AI came on the scene. In the United States, overall programmer employment <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/14/programming-jobs-lost-artificial-intelligence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fell a dramatic 27.5 percent</a> between 2023 and 2025, according to data from the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics</a>. But employment for software <em><em>developers</em></em>\u2014a distinct, more design-oriented position in the government data\u2014only fell 0.3 percent in the same period.</p><p>At the same time, some positions, such as information security analyst and AI engineer are actually growing, Malan says. \u201cThere\u2019s been this pretty dramatic readjustment of the job landscape, even with as narrow a field as IT. Within IT, some jobs have exploded, like InfoSec analysts have grown in double digits, whereas programmers declined double digits\u201d over the past few years, he says. (Eventually, Malan says he expects generative AI to affect all intellectual work.)</p><p>Job responsibilities also appear to be changing. For recent graduates pursuing roles labeled as software-engineering jobs, \u201cthey\u2019re not necessarily just coding,\u201d says <a href=\"https://careerservices.upenn.edu/blog/author/jamie00upenn-edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Grant</a>, senior associate director for the engineering team at the <a href=\"https://careerservices.upenn.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Pennsylvania\u2019s career services</a>. \u201cThere tends to be so much higher-order thinking and knowledge of the software-development life cycle,\u201d as well as a need to work with other parties, such as understanding user and client demands, she says.</p><h2>Using AI to Your Advantage</h2><p>In her work advising Penn students, Grant hears concerns about AI\u2019s effects on the job market from many engineering students and their parents. But during conversations with them, she says she tries to maintain an ethos of \u201cwe can make this work for us, not against us.\u201d</p><p>According to a report from the <a href=\"https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Digital Economy Lab</a>, jobs involving tasks that could be <em><em>automated</em></em> with AI appear to be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-impact-on-job-market\" target=\"_self\">more susceptible to early-career employment dips</a> than those where AI <em><em>augments</em></em> an employee\u2019s ability to perform their job. The <a href=\"https://naceweb.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2025/publication/research-report/nace-2026-job-outlook-report.pdf?ct=YTo2OntzOjY6InNvdXJjZSI7YToyOntpOjA7czoxNDoiY2FtcGFpZ24uZXZlbnQiO2k6MTtpOjI1OTt9czo1OiJlbWFpbCI7aToyNTk5O3M6NDoic3RhdCI7czoyMjoiNjkxZjUyNTE2YjE4MDkxOTc5ODc0OCI7czo5OiJzZW50X3RpbWUiO2k6MTc2MzY2MDM2OTtzOjQ6ImxlYWQiO3M6NzoiNTc3MjA2NiI7czo3OiJjaGFubmVsIjthOjE6e3M6NToiZW1haWwiO2k6MjU5OTt9fQ%3D%3D&amp;utm_source=nace-interntips-nurture-v1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=lead-gen-2025-nace-interntips\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NACE data</a> supports this: Sixty-one percent of employers say they are not replacing entry-level jobs with AI, while 41 percent are discussing or planning to augment these jobs with AI within the next five years.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Two charts showing 12-month employment averages over time, from the 1980s until present. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"889a5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-charts-showing-12-month-employment-averages-over-time-from-the-1980s-until-present.png?id=62599610&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Over the past few years, computer-programmer employment in the United States has dropped sharply\u2014but overall employment in the computing industry hasn\u2019t seen the same decline. </small></p><p>\u201cThink about an exoskeleton that you could wear that allows you to lift 1,000 pounds,\u201d Grant says. \u201cAI should be, just as the people at Stanford say, an augmentation to your work, to your higher-order critical-thinking skills.\u201d That being said, she advises students to be cautious of the risks, such as sharing sensitive or proprietary information with a chatbot.</p><p>At this point, Grant thinks proficiency with AI tools is an unwritten expectation of many employers. But students and early-career workers should also recognize where AI can\u2019t help. \u201cAI can\u2019t necessarily be with you in that moment of negotiation or of client-relationship development,\u201d she says. \u201cYou still need to be able to perform at your highest level of capabilities.\u201d And <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/08/soft-skills-matter-now-more-than-ever-according-to-new-research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">foundational skills</a> like problem solving and communication are consistently prioritized by employers.</p><h2>How Education Needs to Change</h2><p>With AI tools performing more of the \u201cgrunt work\u201d that has served as a training ground for early-career workers, expectations for recent graduates are high. In the past, junior engineers have cultivated proficiency while doing simpler, more task-oriented work. \u201cBut if all of those are going to get taken over, you need to slot in at a higher level almost from day one,\u201d Malan says. This leaves recent graduates in a difficult spot.</p><p>To help students prepare, the education system will likely need to change, for instance by encouraging students to become <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-jobs-in-2025\" target=\"_self\">proficient using AI</a> and take on more hands-on, experiential learning.</p><p>Today\u2019s employers are looking for demonstrated skills, says Grant. \u201cIf you\u2019re just going to class and doing projects and maybe getting a great GPA, that\u2019s amazing. But you also need to be applying what you\u2019re learning,\u201d she says. Industry experience and demonstrated proficiencies are among the top factors considered by employers surveyed in NACE\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.naceweb.org/about-us/press/hiring-is-flat-for-the-college-class-of-2026\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Job Outlook 2026</em></em></a>.</p><p>One solution may even lie in entirely different educational models, like apprenticeship. \u201cOften, students in a more traditional computer-software degree program get a lot of theoretical knowledge,\u201d but they may not have much experience building software on a team, says <a href=\"https://mikeroberts.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Roberts</a>, founder and CEO of the nonprofit <a href=\"https://cccareers.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Creating Coding Careers</a>. Recent graduates may not be ready to ship code on day one\u2014but AI can. Apprenticeship allows students to learn on the job in a structured program, and helps \u201cto much more effectively close the experience gap,\u201d Roberts says.</p><p>Training the next generation of humans might also better serve the long-term interests of employers, he says. In today\u2019s software engineering, many companies tend to be short-sighted in their hiring, thinking more of the next quarter than four or five years down the line. But \u201cif you don\u2019t train new early entrants into the market, you will eventually have no more people becoming mid-levels,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cIt\u2019s very myopic.\u201d</p><p>Also, AI can help ramp up new employees faster than ever. \u201cI find it an exciting time, because it\u2019s never been faster to build high-quality software,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cBut it\u2019s weird that folks are not seeing the virtue of continuing to invest in humans.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"
