We document that firms with high robot exposure alter their technological focus over time and shift innovative activities towards AI which automation naturally complements through data accumulation. The shift is more pronounced for firms with greater data generation or prior AI-related research experience. Because AI patents are more costly (e.g., in labor input), albeit more general and original, firms with high automation experience a significant rise in R&amp;D expenditure but an initial drop in patent quantity, before benefiting\u2014an innovation \u201cJ-Curve.\u201d Our findings not only resolve the puzzle that globally firms invent less despite the greater research effort amidst rising automation, but also provides insights on the heterogeneous paths of innovation, all of which we rationalize in a parsimonious dynamic equilibrium model."

Using household survey and bank customer data during Hungary's 2008 currency crisis, we find that foreign currency borrowers cut consumption one-for-one with increased debt service, consistent with a foreign currency Fisher channel. Both the quantity and quality of expenditures decline, indicating a \"flight from quality.\" Debt revaluation has a limited effect on overall labor supply, but there is substitution toward foreign income and home production. Our findings point to the relevance of open-economy models with incomplete markets, heterogeneous foreign currency exposures, and liquidity constraints."

Using a database of abortion provider locations and operations in Texas from 2009\u20132019, we exploit variation in travel distance to the nearest facility created by clinic closures following the enforcement of Texas HB-2 in 2013. We confirm previous evidence that increased distance to the nearest abortion facility reduces abortions and increases births. We provide novel evidence that reduced access to abortion also leads to significant economic hardship, reflected in lower labor force participation, rising debt, widening income inequality, and heightened housing insecurity. This financial strain translates into higher rates of financially motivated crime, such as theft and burglary, with no significant effect on violent crime. These effects extend beyond directly affected individuals, reflecting intrahousehold spillovers. These findings suggest far-reaching consequences of restricted access to reproductive healthcare."

A credible answer to this question is foundational for understanding the nature and scope of racial inequality and discrimination in the United States. This article reviews and synthesizes a literature that studies this question by estimating the extent to which controlling for measures of human capital changes Black-white gaps in labor market outcomes, and discusses various conceptual and methodological issues related to interpreting this type of exercise. I show that while accurately interpreting this exercise and its many variants requires careful thinking, the results elucidate many important and subtle aspects of racial inequality in the United States."

        "summary": "We provide empirical evidence on the importance of a relatively understudied channel of insurance against labor income shocks: transfers from (cash-rich) parents to (cash-short) children when the latter experience negative wage shocks. Matching population data for Norway across two generations, we establish several results. First, parents make a transfer\u2014i.e., run down liquid assets\u2014when adult children experience negative labor income shocks. Consistent with dynastic insurance, we observe no transfers when income shocks are positive. Second, parents' responses depend on the nature of the shock. If losses are temporary, parents dissave; if they are persistent, parents save in order to make future transfers. Parental transfers offset 43% of temporary and 27% of persistent losses. Third, insurance is lower when children have other smoothing options, like spousal labor supply, and is greater for shocks to their own child versus a child\u2019s spouse. Support also increases if the spouse\u2019s parents can contribute, suggesting \u201ccompetition for attention.\u201d Lastly, insurance flows are one-way: children do not insure their parents against income losses."

And these are just three of the largest companies in an increasingly crowded space.</p><p>Amplifying this message are many financial analysts: <a href=\"https://institute.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/transformation/humanoid-robots.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America Global Research</a>, for example, predicts that global humanoid robot shipments will reach 18,000 units in 2025. And <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/humanoid-robot-market-5-trillion-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley Research estimates</a> that by 2050 there could be over 1 billion humanoid robots, part of a US $5 trillion market.</p><p>But as of now, the market for humanoid robots is almost entirely hypothetical. Even the most successful companies in this space have deployed only a small handful of robots in carefully controlled pilot projects. And future projections seem to be based on an extraordinarily broad interpretation of jobs that a capable, efficient, and safe humanoid robot\u2014which does not currently exist\u2014might conceivably be able to do. Can the current reality connect with the promised scale?</p><h2>What Will It Take to Scale Humanoid Robots?</h2><p>Physically building tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of humanoid robots is certainly possible in the near term. In 2023, <a href=\"https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/record-of-4-million-robots-working-in-factories-worldwide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on the order of 500,000 industrial robots were installed worldwide</a>. Under the basic assumption that a humanoid robot is approximately equivalent to four industrial arms in terms of components, existing supply chains should be able to support even the most optimistic near-term projections for humanoid manufacturing.</p><p>But simply building the robots is arguably the easiest part of scaling humanoids, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meloneewise/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Melonee Wise</a>, who served as chief product officer at Agility Robotics until this month. \u201cThe bigger problem is demand\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone has found an application for humanoids that would require several thousand robots per facility.\u201d Large deployments, Wise explains, are the most realistic way for a robotics company to scale its business, since onboarding any new client can take weeks or months. An alternative approach to deploying several thousand robots to do a single job is to deploy several hundred robots that can each do 10 jobs, which seems to be what most of the humanoid industry is betting on in the medium to long term.</p><p>While there\u2019s a belief across much of the humanoid robotics industry that rapid progress in AI must somehow translate into rapid progress toward multipurpose robots, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/solve-robotics\" target=\"_self\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfvctjoMPk8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clear</a> how, when, or if that will happen. \u201cI think what a lot of people are hoping for is they\u2019re going to AI their way out of this,\u201d says Wise. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is that currently AI is not robust enough to meet the requirements of the market.\u201d</p><h2>Bringing Humanoid Robots to Market</h2><p><span>Market requirements for humanoid robots include a slew of extremely dull, extremely critical things like battery life, reliability, and safety. Of these, battery life is the most straightforward\u2014for a robot to usefully do a job, it can\u2019t spend most of its time charging. The next version of Agility\u2019s Digit robot, which can handle payloads of up to 16 kilograms, includes a bulky \u201cbackpack\u201d containing a battery with a charging ratio of 10 to 1: The robot can run for 90 minutes, and fully recharge in 9 minutes. Slimmer humanoid robots from other companies must necessarily be making compromises to maintain their svelte form factors.</span></p><p>In operation, Digit will probably spend a few minutes charging after running for 30 minutes. That\u2019s because 60 minutes of Digit\u2019s runtime is essentially a reserve in case something happens in its workspace that requires it to temporarily pause, a not-infrequent occurrence in the logistics and manufacturing environments that Agility is targeting. Without a 60-minute reserve, the robot would be much more likely to run out of power mid-task and need to be manually recharged. Consider what that might look like with even a modest deployment of several hundred robots weighing over a hundred kilograms each. \u201cNo one wants to deal with that,\u201d comments Wise.</p><p>Potential customers for humanoid robots are very concerned with downtime. Over the course of a month, a factory operating at 99 percent reliability will see approximately 5 hours of downtime. Wise says that any downtime that stops something like a production line can cost tens of thousands of dollars per minute, which is why many industrial customers expect a couple more 9s of reliability: 99.99 percent. Wise says that Agility has demonstrated this level of reliability in some specific applications, but not in the context of multipurpose or general-purpose functionality.</p><h2>Humanoid Robot Safety</h2><p><span>A humanoid robot in an industrial environment must meet general </span><a href=\"https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/ansi-b11-standards-safety-of-machinery/\" target=\"_blank\">safety</a><span> </span><a href=\"https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2006-42-ec-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a><span> for industrial machines. In the past, robotic systems like autonomous vehicles and drones have benefited from immature regulatory environments to scale quickly. But Wise says that approach can\u2019t work for humanoids, because the industry is already heavily regulated\u2014the robot is simply considered another piece of machinery.</span></p><p>There are also more specific<a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ria/ansiriar15082020\" target=\"_blank\"> safety standards</a> currently under development for humanoid robots, explains Matt Powers, associate director of autonomy R&amp;D at Boston Dynamics. He notes that his company is helping develop an <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/91469.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) safety standard for dynamically balancing legged robots</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that the top players in the field, like Agility and Figure, are joining us in developing a way to explain why we believe that the systems that we\u2019re deploying are safe,\u201d Powers says.</p><p>These standards are necessary because the traditional safety approach of cutting power may not be a good option for a dynamically balancing system. Doing so will cause a humanoid robot to fall over, potentially making the situation even worse. There is no simple solution to this problem, and the initial approach that Boston Dynamics expects to take with its Atlas robot is to keep the robot out of situations where simply powering it off might not be the best option. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with relatively low-risk deployments, and then expand as we build confidence in our safety systems,\u201d Powers says. \u201cI think a methodical approach is really going to be the winner here.\u201d</p><p>In practice, low risk means keeping humanoid robots away from people. But humanoids that are restricted by what jobs they can safely do and where they can safely move are going to have more trouble finding tasks that provide value.</p><h2>Are Humanoids the Answer?</h2><p><span>The issues of demand, battery life, reliability, and safety all need to be solved before humanoid robots can scale. But a more fundamental question to ask is whether a bipedal robot is actually worth the trouble.</span></p><p>Dynamic balancing with legs would theoretically enable these robots to navigate complex environments like a human. Yet demo videos show these humanoid robots as either mostly stationary or repetitively moving short distances over flat floors. The promise is that what we\u2019re seeing now is just the first step toward humanlike mobility. But in the short to medium term, there are much more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective platforms that can take over in these situations: robots with arms, but with wheels instead of legs.</p><p>Safe and reliable humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize the labor market at some point in the future. But potential is just that, and despite the humanoid enthusiasm, we have to be realistic about what it will take to turn potential into reality. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cWhy Humanoid Robots Aren\u2019t Scaling.\u201d</em></p>"

Three groups won parts of a </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-finalizes-aidrfic-research-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">$30 million grant to transform the design of RF chips using machine learning</a><span>, but at least one awardee has gotten no word on when or whether the funding will flow.</span></p><p>\u201cThis is a sad end,\u201d said one person who requested anonymity and was involved in early debate about the NSTC. </p><p>Lutnick\u2019s characterization of Natcast\u2019s creation as cronyism \u201cis pretty frustrating,\u201d this person continued. The idea that NSTC would be operated by an independent public-private partnership, which is written into the law, came from deep consultation with industry and was intended to insulate its work from politics. The organization needed such protection to make good technical decisions, because in selecting who gets funds \u201cthere are always more losers than winners,\u201d this person said.</p><p>Over the past week, Natcast has been defending itself and its staff against Lutnick\u2019s accusations. On 4 September, in a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-member-letter-regarding-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">letter to its 200 members</a>, Hanford countered Lutnick\u2019s assertions that the organization was packed with Biden administration cronies and that it was run as a \u201cslush fund.\u201d Hanford pointed to the multiple layers of government and industry oversight Natcast operates under and the experienced semiconductor industry staff it has brought on. She added that the nonprofit had stuck to its agreements with the government, submitting 119 \u201cmilestones and deliverables\u201d to Commerce.</p><h2>What\u2019s Lost Without Natcast</h2><p>On 8 September, Natcast published a detailed <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-assets-supporting-the-continued-mission-of-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">overview of what it has done so far</a>. Accomplishments included creating an industry-driven R&amp;D agenda, the development of multiple workforce programs, and the signing on of some 200 members. These members included cutting-edge logic and memory companies (such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skhynix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SK Hynix</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona\" target=\"_self\">TSMC</a>), small companies like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/atomera-plans-to-breathe-new-life-into-older-chip-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">Atomera</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=encharge+ai\" target=\"_self\">EnCharge AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">Polar Semiconductor</a>, and multiple universities and makers of semiconductor tools and equipment.</p><p><a href=\"https://natcast.org/nstcmembership/members\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a> had the right to use facilities and other infrastructure that Natcast was standing up (for a fee) and participate in research. One goal for the infrastructure was to reduce the time from concept to prototype by 30 percent. Access to the tools and processes NSTC would provide is out of reach for even some of the country\u2019s top researchers, <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s source said. Without that access, startups and researchers won\u2019t be able to afford to do relevant work using 300-millimeter wafers and advanced chip-technology nodes. Despite the fact that not all of its facilities were complete, Natcast had plans to proceed with research by chaining together existing infrastructure around the country.</p><p>In addition, the document from 8 September detailed the expert in-house team at Natcast, and said that expertise allowed it to evaluate R&amp;D awards at twice the rate of federal agencies while requiring considerably less overhead than government, universities, and non-profit research organizations like Imec. (It forecast a 10 percent overhead on expenses over 10 years.)</p><p>\u201cNatcast was supposed to do what industry couldn\u2019t solve by itself,\u201d said a source familiar with the situation. Its R&amp;D program was aimed at solving big problems, such as collapsing the time and energy required to <a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/smap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">move data between memory and computing</a>, in a way that the whole industry could benefit from.<span></span></p>"

These days, however, blockchain is most famous as the tool enabling <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money?utm_campaign=post-teaser&amp;utm_content=ibfuflhf\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies</a>.

Every time a cryptocurrency transaction is initiated, all parties involved in the transaction need to securely prove that they agree to the transfer. This is done via a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\" target=\"_blank\">digital signature</a>: a cryptographic protocol that generates a secret, private key that is unique to each user and a public key that the user shares. Then, the private key is used to generate a unique signature for each transaction. The public key can be used to verify that, indeed, the signature was created by the holder of the private key. In this way, Web3 in every incarnation relies heavily on cryptography. </span></p><p><span>To learn more about the evolution of Web3, and cryptography\u2019s role, we caught up with</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://wahby.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Riad Wahby</a><span>, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, and a cofounder and CEO of hardware-backed Web3 security platform </span><a href=\"https://cubist.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Cubist</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> Wahby explained what Web3 was meant to be, what it\u2019s become, and how hardware-backed cryptography will enable its future.<br /></span></p><h3>Web3 Began as a Response to What Came Before</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: What is Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Riad Wahby:</strong> That\u2019s the hardest question that you\u2019re going to ask by far, because I don\u2019t know how to answer it in a way that satisfies everyone.</p><p>The term Web3 was coined around 2014, by people who looked at the way that the Web had developed. Web 1.0 was the first Web bubble, the dot-com bubble. Web 2.0, roughly speaking, is Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Apple and Netflix, and the like. And the perception, especially from folks who originally coined this term Web3, was that these companies had basically taken the Web in the wrong direction, because your privacy is gone, and you\u2019re the product, so to speak. You use Gmail for free because Google is mining your emails to sell things like better advertising. Web3 was originally a reaction to this. Early proponents of Web3 basically said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We want to take back control of our stuff. I want to own my own data, and maybe cryptocurrencies and blockchains are the way there.\u201d So that\u2019s where the term originally came from.</p><p><strong>What does the term mean now?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Now it doesn\u2019t mean anything like that at all. Now Web3 is the broader ecosystem around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. And I think basically all of that revolutionary spirit has gone away in favor of building financial products and making a lot of money doing it. As far as I can tell, the term has really transformed from a reaction to a lack of privacy and a lack of sovereignty in my own data to \u201cHey, this is a technology that has something to do with blockchains.\u201d Maybe you can buy some kind of speculative meme coin and make a bunch of money doing it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe that took a dark turn at the end. That\u2019s how things go.</p><p><strong>How are those two definitions connected?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Cryptography really fits into the revolutionary spirit, in the sense that the folks who want to cast off the chains of things like Google and Facebook, one of the tenets was\u2014\u201dThe way that we\u2019ll do that is we\u2019ll build this technology that\u2019s sort of amazing and that gives us all these great properties.\u201d And they were going to do that using some advanced cryptographic technologies. This is the reason that there\u2019s so many people who are cryptography researchers at universities that also are involved deeply in some kind of cryptocurrency. Because it\u2019s like this is a sea change in the way that cryptography gets used in the world.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it used to be that if you were working on really any kind of cryptography, regardless of how theoretical or how practical you intended it to be, you knew that there was not much of a chance that any of it was going to get really used in the world, unless it was extremely practical and extremely focused on solving some immediate problem. And it just used to be the case that people were extremely conservative about what kind of cryptography they used. Basically, everyone thought, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of this crazy stuff. That\u2019s all theory. Nobody cares. The only stuff we need is what lets you connect to Amazon and safely buy stuff.\u201d The rise of cryptocurrencies brought with it this whole shift in the way that cryptography gets deployed in the world, where now if you can come up with some interesting functionality that\u2019s enabled by some advanced cryptography, probably somewhere somebody is going to try and turn that into a product that they can sell.</p><h3>Web3 Is Both Good and Bad for Cryptography</h3><p><strong>What effect has this had on the cryptographic community?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> It\u2019s both good and bad. It\u2019s good in that this means that there\u2019s a lot of motivation to build interesting, cool stuff. And as a researcher in cryptography, I love it because it means that there\u2019s tons more research money being poured into cryptography.</p><p>That\u2019s the good side. The bad side is that the reason that people were so conservative about deploying new cryptography is that it\u2019s easy to get the security mechanism wrong. The default state of cryptography is [to assume everything is] broken. You have to be very, very careful that each change that you make isn\u2019t returning your cryptography to the default state. I\u2019m not saying that people in Web3 aren\u2019t careful. They are. It\u2019s just by the nature of things, since it\u2019s a much faster time frame, there\u2019s much more pressure to just push stuff into production. And I think the downside is that we have seen a little bit of brokenness. It\u2019s hopefully not causing people to lose oodles of money. And I think the historical record bears this out: People lose oodles of money because other people are really dishonest, not because the cryptography is broken for the most part. But the cryptography can also be broken, and that can also be worrisome. But I\u2019d say from the perspective of somebody who\u2019s doing research in cryptography, the impact of Web3 on the cryptographic community has generally been a good thing.</p><p><strong>Now you\u2019re focused on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip\" target=\"_blank\">hardware security</a>. Can you explain what that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Any cryptocurrency has this property that if I hold some token, and I want to send it to somebody else, the way that I do that is by producing a digital signature that says, I want to spend this token. The secret key is what lets you generate a signature. So if you have 10 <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-merge-heralds-cryptos-climate-friendly-future\" target=\"_blank\">E</a>TH [cryptocurrency coins], and they\u2019re all protected by this key, and somebody takes a copy of your key, then life is bad.</p><p>With a digital signature key it could just be sitting on your hard drive, and then you get some malware, and now somebody has silently stolen your key. There have been these big, broadly targeted malware campaigns where millions and millions of people have all had their keys stolen. So now the criminals are just like sitting there counting up all the money that they\u2019ve stolen, and there\u2019s no reversing transactions, unlike at a bank.</p><p>Here\u2019s where hardware comes in. This is not really a Web3 technology, this is kind of old, good stuff. There are these devices called hardware security modules, and they\u2019ve been used for multiple decades. This is a physical device, and this device can run certain cryptographic algorithms. And it knows enough that when you tell it, \u201cHey, please generate me a key,\u201d it can generate you a key securely. And when you tell it, \u201cPlease give me a signature,\u201d it can give you a signature securely. But the important thing is the way that it\u2019s designed, the key never leaves this piece of hardware. It turns what was a piece of data into a physical object. And we know how to secure a physical object.</p><p><strong>You\u2019re working on extending hardware security for more use cases. Can you explain what you\u2019re doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> There are two issues with the standard hardware security module.</p><p>No. 1, you need more cryptography support, so you need to be able to apply digital signatures to transactions very quickly if you\u2019re actively trading. And No. 2, you need a way of expressing that it\u2019s not just a key that can generate any signature. It\u2019s a key that also has attached to it some kind of policy that says these are the kinds of signatures that are okay to generate, and everything else is not allowed, to add extra security. These are the two directions that we have that our technology enables within traditional hardware security modules.</p><p>We start with the security that\u2019s provided by the traditional hardware security module, and we extend it using this, actually another piece of trusted hardware called the Trusted Execution Environment. We extend it to support the actual kinds of cryptography that are needed for Web3 and to support this rich programmable policy layer that lets you say, \u201cThis key is only intended for this specific kind of use,\u201d or \u201canytime somebody tries to make a payment from this key, first I have to check whether the recipient is subject to sanctions,\u201d or any other rule. So in the end, we have, not only a hardware security module, we have also this Trusted Execution Environment and this policy layer, and all this other cryptographic stuff that together gives us a hardware security module that\u2019s really designed for the Web3 use case.</p>"

But one bold query I received in January 2024 went much further: An undergraduate engineering student named <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatosin-kolade/?originalSubdomain=ng\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oluwatosin Kolade</a>, from Obafemi Awolowo University, in Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300, Nigeria, volunteered to be our robotics editor. </p><p>Kolade\u2014Tosin to his friends\u2014had been the newsletter editor for his IEEE student branch, but he\u2019d never published an article professionally. His earnestness and enthusiasm were endearing. I explained that we already have a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/evan-ackerman\" target=\"_self\">robotics editor</a>, but I\u2019d be glad to work with him on writing, editing, and ultimately publishing an article. </p><p> Back in 2003, I had met plenty of engineering students when I traveled to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\">Nigeria to report </a>on the SAT-3/WASC cable, the first undersea fiber-optic cable to land in West Africa. I remember seeing students gathering around obsolete PCs at Internet caf\u00e9s connected to the world via a satellite dish powered by a generator. I challenged Tosin to tell <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> readers what it\u2019s like for engineering students today. The result is \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Lessons from a Janky Drone</a>.\u201d</p><p>I decided to complement Tosin\u2019s piece with the perspective of a more established engineer in sub-Saharan Africa. I reached out to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/g-pascal-zachary\" target=\"_self\">G. Pascal Zachary</a>, who has covered engineering education in Africa for us, and Zachary introduced me to <a href=\"https://ibaino.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Engineer Bainomugisha</a>, a computer science professor at Makerere University, in Kampala, Uganda. In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/africa-engineering-hardware\" target=\"_blank\">Learning More With Less</a>,\u201d Bainomugisha draws out the things that were common to his and Tosin\u2019s experience and suggests ways to make the hardware necessary for engineering education more accessible.</p><p>In fact, the region\u2019s decades-long struggle to develop its engineering talent hinges on access to the three things we focus on in this issue: reliable electricity, ubiquitous broadband, and educational resources for young engineers.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cDuring my weekly video calls with Tosin...the connection was pretty good\u2014 except when it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p><span>Zachary\u2019s article in this issue, \u201c</span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electricity-access-sub-saharan-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What It Will Really Take to Electrify All of Africa</a><span>\u201d</span><span> tackles the first topic, with a focus on an ambitious initiative to bring electricity to an additional 300 million people by 2030.</span></p><p> Contributing editor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/lucas-laursen\" target=\"_self\">Lucas Laursen</a>\u2019s article, \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/broadband-internet-in-nigeria\" target=\"_blank\">In Nigeria, Why Isn\u2019t Broadband Everywhere?</a>\u201d investigates the slow rollout of fiber-optic connectivity in the two decades since my first visit. As he learned when he traveled to Nigeria earlier this year, the country now has eight undersea cables delivering 380 terabits of capacity, yet less than half of the population has broadband access. </p><p>I got a sense of Nigeria\u2019s bandwidth issues during my weekly video calls with Tosin to discuss his article. The connection was pretty good, except when it wasn\u2019t. Still, I reminded myself, two decades ago such calls would have been nearly impossible. </p><p>Through those weekly chats, we established a professional connection, which made it that much more meaningful when I got to meet Tosin in person this past May at the <a href=\"https://2025.ieee-icra.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE ICRA robotics conference</a>, in Atlanta. Tosin was attending thanks to a scholarship from the <a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</a>. Like a kid in a candy shop, he kibbutzed with fellow scholarship winners, attended talks, checked out robots, and met the engineers who built them. </p><p>As Tosin embarks on the next leg in his career journey, he is supported by the IEEE community, which not only recognizes his promise but gives him access to a network of professionals who can help him and his cohort realize their potential.</p>"

The old methods\u2014growing more and bigger trees in temperate and tropical forests, stuffing more carbon into soils\u2014can be cheap, but they have limits. Forests burn, die from disease, or get cut down, releasing some of the carbon they store. Microorganisms eventually break down much of what\u2019s in the soil. Both are hard to audit and constrained by available land. Another option\u2014pulverized minerals spread on fields\u2014can solidify airborne carbon.

While we haven\u2019t yet gotten to the point where we\u2019ve lost access to space, there will come a day where that will happen if we don\u2019t do something about it. A new paper from <a href=\"https://www.eng.tohoku.ac.jp/english/research/embryo/takahashi.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kazunori Takahashi</a> of Tohoku University in Japan looks at a novel solution that uses a type of magnetic field typically seen in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/fusion-2662267312\" target=\"_blank\">fusion reactors</a> to decelerate debris using a plasma beam, while balancing itself with an equal and opposite thrust on the other side.</p><p>Researchers have been working on two main categories of systems for the type of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electrodynamic-tether-deborbit-satellite\" target=\"_blank\">deorbiting</a> work that might save us from Kessler Syndrome\u2014contact and non-contact. Contact systems physically make contact with the debris, such as by a net or a grappling hook, and slow the debris to a point where it can deorbit safely. This method faces the challenge that most debris is rotating uncontrollably, and could potentially destroy the satellite trying to make contact with it if it move unexpectedly\u2014adding to the problem rather than solving it.</p><div class=\"badge_module shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\">\n<a class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"Universe Today logo; text reads &quot;This post originally appeared on Universe Today.&quot;\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/universe-today-logo-text-reads-this-post-originally-appeared-on-universe-today.png?id=60568425&amp;width=1800&amp;quality=85\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p><span>Therefore, non-contact forms are in the ascendancy, as they allow a system designed to deorbit another satellite to stay a few meters away while still affecting its speed. Typically they use systems like lasers, ion beams, or in the case of Takahashi\u2019s invention, plasma beams, to slow their intended target to a point where it can safely deorbit. </span>The problem with plasma beam-based deorbiting systems is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion\" target=\"_blank\">Newton\u2019s third law</a>\u2014as the plasma is being directed toward the target, it is pushing the operational system away from the defunct one, essentially acting as a small plasma thruster. As the distance between the two increases, the slowing effect of the plasma decreases. To solve this problem, Takahashi and his fellow researchers presented a <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/articles/a-new-solution-to-the-space-junk-problem-spacecraft-with-plasma-beams-to-force-space-junk-to-burn-up\" target=\"_blank\">bi-directional thruster in a paper in 2018</a> that counteracted the pushing force of the plasma used to slow the target with an equal force in the opposite direction, allowing it to maintain its position.</p><h2>Advancements in Plasma Thruster Technology</h2><p>However, in that original paper, the thrust was too weak to effectively deorbit some of the larger potential targets for such a mission. So Takahashi set about improving the design by implementing a \u201ccusp-type\u201d magnetic field. These are typically used in fusion reactors to ensure the plasma doesn\u2019t interact with the wall of the magnetic chamber. The cusp of a magnetic field is a point at which two opposing magnetic fields meet and cancel out, creating a quick change in direction for the forces they apply. Ideally, this results in a stronger plasma beam.</p><p><span>That is what happened when Takahashi set up an experiment to test the new cusp system with the previous \u201cstraight-field\u201d system that had proved too weak. He saw a 20 percent improvement in the force that the plasma thruster exerted on the target, resulting in a 17.1 millinewton push at the same power level. When he bumped up the power level to 5 kW (compared to the 3 kW in the original test), it showed an improved deceleration of about 25 mN, which is approaching the level of 30 mN expected to be needed to decelerate a 1 ton piece of debris in 100 days. It also had the added benefit of using argon as fuel, which is cheaper compared to the xenon typically used in plasma thrusters.</span></p><p><span></span>Even with this success, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do before this becomes a fully fleshed out system. The experiment was run in a vacuum chamber, with the plasma thruster only 30 centimeters away from the target, compared to the meters that would be required in a real orbital environment. In fact, the debris target will also move in comparison to the deorbiting system as it slows down, so it will have to strike a balance of maintaining distance from a slowing object as well as continuing to fire the decelerating beam at it. And finally, there is the disadvantage of it using literally twice as much fuel as other solutions that don\u2019t require thrusters operating is opposite directions\u2014while fuel might not be much of a concern for plasma thrusters, operating one over 100 days is sure to consume a lot of it.</p><p>With all that being said, any new solution to this potentially catastrophic problem is welcome, and Takahashi will likely continue work on developing this prototype. Someday soon you might even be able to watch a dual-thrust plasma engine blasting away at a large piece of space junk.</p>"

Then, after an encouraging review, my manager asked if I\u2019d start managing a team of my own. I had received strong performance ratings and earned trust among my colleagues and the leadership team, and the organization\u2019s headcount was consistently increasing each year.</span></p><p>This is the standard origin story for engineers who transition to management. But the skills required to succeed as an engineer and the ones a manager has to have are significantly different. Strong engineers succeed through rigorous analytical ability and deep work. Strong managers (whose work is decidedly un-analytical!) motivate and grow people\u2019s <span>careers</span>, while also being prepared to jump into issues at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p><span>The ideal motivation to become a manager is simple: </span><strong>You care about people</strong><span>. Management is inherently a people-oriented </span><span>job</span><span>, which means managers should grow their reports through positive and constructive feedback. A good manager cares about discovering each person\u2019s zone of genius and then assigning work that best matches that engineer\u2019s profile. The byproduct of this is the ability to scale impact, but that should not be the primary motive.</span></p><p><span>A common, yet misguided, reason to switch to management is to earn more money. At least within Big Tech companies, managers and ICs at the same level are paid the same amount. In fact, some companies deliberately pay their managers less, simply to discourage mercenary engineers who are optimizing for compensation rather than people.</span></p><p><span></span><span>However, there is nuance here that\u2019s worth calling out. At more senior levels, managers are promoted at faster rates compared to ICs. A manager\u2019s impact is largely derived from their influence in an org, which includes the number of people in their reporting chain. A director with 50 engineers in their org can effectively \u201cclaim credit\u201d for the people on their team.</span></p><p><span></span><span>On the other hand, an individual contributor at the director level must produce output that has a similar scale of impact to what the 50 engineers shipped. As you can imagine, this is much harder. IC promotions at these levels require a level of technical brilliance that is difficult to reliably reproduce.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Managers often get promoted as they accumulate more people under them. This process can happen through re-orgs or employee departures, not necessarily through the unique contributions of the manager. The result is that managers who stick around long enough will naturally grow their </span><span>careers</span><span>. Empirically, this is obvious in the data. At a company like Meta or Google, there are far more VP-level managers than there are IC engineers of the equivalent level.</span></p><p><span></span><span>In the long term, therefore, managers do earn more money than individual contributors. This is not necessarily wrong, but you should reflect on your incentives and determine what will make you fulfilled beyond the money.</span></p><p><span>I ended up saying yes to the management opportunity I was offered, and I\u2019m very glad I did. Like any <span><span>job</span></span>, there were parts that I loved and parts that I didn\u2019t, and I ended up switching back to the IC ladder within a year.</span></p><p><span>\u2014Rahul</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-budget-cuts-trump-staff\" target=\"_blank\">NASA Cut 4,000 Staff, Where Will They Go?</a></h3><p><span></span><span>The U.S. space agency is undergoing a large \u201creduction in force,\u201d which includes about 4,000 employees who have taken offers to leave their positions through a \u201cdeferred resignation program.\u201d Where will ex-NASA engineers go next, and what does it mean for future missions?</span></p><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-budget-cuts-trump-staff\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What I Learned From a Janky Drone</a></h3><p><span>A Nigerian engineering student describes his experience as part of a pair of articles on engineering education in Africa, from the perspective of both a student and teacher. \u201cThey describe the challenges they face and what they see as the path forward for a continent brimming with aspiring engineers but woefully short on the resources necessary for a robust education,\u201d <em>IEEE Spectrum\u2019</em>s editor-in-chief Harry Goldstein writes in an accompanying note.</span><span></span></p><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-founders-prioritize-the-problem\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Founders Must Learn to Prioritize the Problem</a></h3><p>Taking innovative tech to market can be tricky for engineers coming from a research background.

A case in point, MLPerf, the bi-annual machine learning competition sometimes termed \u201cthe Olympics of AI,\u201d introduced three new benchmark tests, reflecting new directions in the field.</p><p>\u201cLately, it has been very difficult trying to follow what happens in the field,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-hodak/\" target=\"_blank\">Miro Hodak</a>, AMD engineer and MLPerf Inference working group co-chair. \u201cWe see that the models are becoming progressively larger, and in the last two rounds we have introduced the largest models we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>The chips that tackled these new benchmarks came from the usual suspects\u2014Nvidia, Arm, and Intel. Nvidia topped the charts, introducing its new <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/?ncid=no-ncid\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blackwell Ultra</a> GPU, packaged in a <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb300-nvl72/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GB300</a> rack-scale design. AMD put up a strong performance, introducing its latest <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi325x.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MI325X</a> GPUs. Intel proved that one can still do inference on CPUs with their <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/xeon.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xeon</a> submissions, but also entered the GPU game with an <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/workstations/b-series/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Arc Pro</a> submission.</p><h2>New Benchmarks</h2><p>Last round, MLPerf <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-inference\" target=\"_self\">introduced</a> its largest benchmark yet, a large language model based on Llama3.1-403B. This round, they topped themselves yet again, introducing a benchmark based on the Deepseek R1 671B model\u2014more than 1.5 times the number of parameters of the previous largest benchmark.</p><p>As a reasoning model, Deepseek R1 goes through several steps of chain-of-thought when approaching a query. This means much of the computation happens during inference then in normal LLM operation, making this benchmark even more challenging. Reasoning models are claimed to be the most accurate, making them the technique of choice for science, math, and complex programming queries.</p><p>In addition to the largest LLM benchmark yet, MLPerf also introduced the smallest, based on Llama3.1-8B. There is growing industry demand for low latency yet high-accuracy reasoning, explained Taran Iyengar, MLPerf Inference task force chair. Small LLMs can supply this, and are an excellent choice for tasks such as text summarization and edge applications.</p><p>This brings the total count of LLM-based benchmarks to a confusing four. They include the new, smallest Llama3.1-8B benchmark; a pre-existing Llama2-70B benchmark; last round\u2019s introduction of the Llama3.1-403B benchmark; and the largest, the new Deepseek R1 model. If nothing else, this signals LLMs are not going anywhere.</p><p>In addition to the myriad LLMs, this round of MLPerf inference included a new voice-to-text model, based on Whisper-large-v3. This benchmark is a response to the growing number of voice-enabled applications, be it smart devices or speech-based AI interfaces.</p><p>TheMLPerf Inference competition has two broad categories: \u201cclosed,\u201d which requires using the reference neural network model as-is without modifications, and \u201copen,\u201d where some modifications to the model are allowed. Within those, there are several subcategories related to how the tests are done and in what sort of infrastructure. We will focus on the \u201cclosed\u201d datacenter server results for the sake of sanity.</p><h2>Nvidia leads</h2><p>Surprising no one, the best performance per accelerator on each benchmark, at least in the \u2018server\u2019 category, was achieved by an Nvidia GPU-based system. Nvidia also unveiled the Blackwell Ultra, topping the charts in the two largest benchmarks: Lllama3.1-405B and DeepSeek R1 reasoning.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24996953/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p><a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-blackwell-ultra-for-the-era-of-ai-reasoning/#:~:text=vs.,-HGX%20H100&amp;text=Blackwell%20Ultra%20brings%20even%20more,processing%20millions%20of%20input%20tokens.\" target=\"_blank\">Blackwell Ultra</a> is a more powerful iteration of the Blackwell architecture, featuring significantly more memory capacity, double the acceleration for attention layers, 1.5x more AI compute, and faster memory and connectivity compared to the standard Blackwell. It is intended for the larger AI workloads, like the two benchmarks it was tested on.</p><p>In addition to the hardware improvements, director of accelerated computing products at Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davesalvator/\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Salvator</a> attributes the success of Blackwell Ultra to two key changes. First, the use of Nvidia\u2019s proprietary 4-bit floating point <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/number-representation\" target=\"_self\">number format</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvfp4-for-efficient-and-accurate-low-precision-inference/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NVFP4</a>. \u201cWe can deliver comparable accuracy to formats like BF16,\u201d Salvator says, while using a lot less computing power.</p><p>The second is so-called <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/latest/architecture/disagg_serving.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">disaggregated serving</a>. The idea behind disaggregated serving is that there are two main parts to the inference workload: prefill, where the query (\u201cPlease summarize this report.\u201d) and its entire context window (the report) are loaded into the LLM, and generation/decoding, where the output is actually calculated. These two stages have different requirements. While prefill is compute heavy, generation/decoding is much more dependent on memory bandwidth. Salvator says that by assigning different groups of GPUs to the two different stages, Nvidia achieves a performance gain of nearly 50 percent.</p><h2>AMD close behind</h2><p>AMD\u2019s newest accelerator chip, MI355X launched in July. The company offered results only in the \u201copen\u201d category where software modifications to the model are permitted. Like Blackwell Ultra, MI355x features 4-bit floating point support, as well as expanded high-bandwidth memory. The MI355X beat its predecessor, the MI325X, in the open Llama2.1-70B benchmark by a factor of 2.7, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahesh-balas/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mahesh Balasubramanian</a>, senior director of data center GPU product marketing at AMD.</p><p>AMD\u2019s \u201cclosed\u201d submissions included systems powered by AMD MI300X and MI325X GPUs. The more advanced MI325X computer performed similarly to those built with Nvidia H200s on the Lllama2-70b, the mixture of experts test, and image generation benchmarks.</p><p>This round also included the first hybrid submission, where both AMD MI300X and MI325X GPUs were used for the same inference task,the Llama2-70b benchmark. The use of hybrid GPUs is important, because new GPUs are coming at a <a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/03/19/nvidia-draws-gpu-system-roadmap-out-to-2028/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">yearly cadence</a>, and the older models, deployed en-masse, are not going anywhere. Being able to spread workloads between different kinds of GPUs is an essential step.</p><h2>Intel enters the GPU game</h2><p>In the past, Intel has remained steadfast that one does not need a GPU to do machine learning. Indeed, submissions using Intel\u2019s Xeon CPU still performed on par with the Nvidia L4 on the object detection benchmark but trailed on the recommender system benchmark.</p><p>This round, for the first time, an Intel GPU also made a showing. The <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/workstations/b-series/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Arc Pro</a> was first released in 2022. The MLPerf submission featured a graphics card called the <a href=\"https://www.maxsun.com/products/intel-arc-pro-b60-dual-48g-turbo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MaxSun Intel Arc Pro B60 Dual 48G Turbo</a> , which contains two GPUs and 48 gigabytes of memory. The system performed on-par with Nvidia\u2019s L40S on the small LLM benchmark and trailed it on the Llama2-70b benchmark.</p>"

It also runs hot, literally: The data centers operating artificial intelligence (AI) models use large amounts of electricity and generate enormous heat. To keep servers from overheating, many facilities rely on cooling systems that use water.</p><p>AI data centers\u2019 water use comes in two forms. Beyond the water that cools the servers, data centers indirectly contribute to water use through the electricity generation needed to power their operations. That indirect use often makes up <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3724499\" target=\"_blank\">80 percent or more</a> of the overall water use.</p><p>Reducing AI\u2019s water footprint means tackling two very different issues\u2014what happens inside the data center walls, and what happens beyond them on the power grid.</p><h2>Direct Water Use: Local and Sometimes Stressful</h2><p>Just as human bodies cool themselves by sweating, data centers are often cooled by water evaporation\u2014a process that dissipates heat and results in water being lost to the atmosphere, and thus being counted as \u201cconsumed.\u201d In many cases, the water is drawn from the same municipal systems that supply homes and businesses.</p><p>While most major tech companies now disclose their direct water use,<a href=\"https://datacenter.uptimeinstitute.com/rs/711-RIA-145/images/2024.GlobalDataCenterSurvey.Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> not all data centers follow suit</a>, making the overall picture unclear. In recent reports, companies have estimated that between <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apples_Water_Strategy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">45 percent</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2024/09/19/how-data-centers-use-water-and-how-were-working-to-use-water-responsibly/\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent</a> of withdrawn water is consumed.</p><p>According to a recent report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the 2023 direct water consumption by data centers in the United States\u2014home to about <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/investing-in-the-rising-data-center-economy\" target=\"_blank\">40 percent of the world\u2019s data centers</a>\u2014is estimated at <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/32d6m0d1\" target=\"_blank\">roughly 17.5 billion gallons</a>. Assuming a 50 percent consumption ratio, that means 35 billion gallons of water withdrawal, or about 0.3 percent of the <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/pp1894D/full\" target=\"_blank\">total public water supply</a> for the contiguous United States. The same report projects that the U.S. data center direct water consumption could double or even quadruple the 2023 level by 2028.</p><p>On the national level, data centers\u2019 water use is relatively modest. But in some regions where data centers are concentrated\u2014and especially in regions already facing shortages\u2014the strain on local water systems can be significant. <em>Bloomberg News</em> reports that about two-thirds of U.S. data centers built since 2022 <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-impacts-data-centers-water-data/\" target=\"_blank\">are in high water-stress areas</a>. </p><p>In Newton County, Georgia, some proposed data centers have reportedly requested more water per day than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the entire county uses</a> daily. Officials there now face tough choices: reject new projects, require alternative water-efficient cooling systems, invest in costly infrastructure upgrades, or risk imposing water rationing on residents.</p><p>The biggest stress may not be total use, but timing. On hot days when residents and businesses need water most, data center water demand spikes too. In Arizona, a data center\u2019s monthly water usage during the summer can be <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344922000428\" target=\"_blank\">nearly twice its average level</a>.</p><h2>Indirect Water Use: Thirsty Electricity</h2><p>The other part of the equation is the electricity that powers data centers. In many places, electricity\u2014whether for training AI models in data centers or turning on a lightbulb in a home\u2014is generated by fossil fuel-based power plants that require cooling water of their own. The U.S. electric power sector<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56820\" target=\"_blank\"> withdraws about 11.6 gallons of water</a> and<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/32d6m0d1\" target=\"_blank\"> consumes 1.2 gallons</a> for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced, placing it among the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/source-and-use-water-us-2015\" target=\"_blank\">nation\u2019s largest water users</a>. The water used to produce the electricity that powers data centers is considered indirect water use. </p><p>The water used by power plants is typically not potable and not drawn from municipal water systems. Still, it can place stress on rivers, aquifers, and ecosystems\u2014especially in water-scarce regions.</p><p>For most U.S. data centers, this indirect use is significantly higher than direct onsite water use. One paper estimated that in 2023, using GPT-3 to generate a single text output of 150 to 300 words <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3724499\" target=\"_blank\">consumed a total of 16.9 milliliters</a> of water in an average U.S. data center\u20142.2 ml for onsite cooling and 14.7 ml for electricity generation. It\u2019s likely that efficiency gains in later models have reduced these numbers, but indirect water use still predominates.</p><h2>How to Minimize Data Centers\u2019 Water Impact</h2><p>Unlike electricity, data center cooling systems are a design choice. Evaporative cooling is low-cost and efficient, but it can burden local supplies during summer heatwaves, when water is most needed and least available. To manage that peak demand, data centers can build onsite water storage or install thermal energy storage. Upgrading water infrastructure\u2014such as expanding distribution or fixing leaks\u2014can also help local systems better handle demand spikes.</p><p>Alternatives to evaporative cooling include air-based and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/immersion-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">liquid-immersion cooling</a>, using recycled water to cut potable water use, and waste heat reuse to reduce cooling demand. Some advanced designs recycle cooling water in a closed-loop, so no water is consumed; these \u201czero-water\u201d designs eliminate the need to tap into local drinking water supplies. However, many of these designs raise electricity demand, which in turn can increase indirect water use. Water-cooled data centers <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-commitment-to-climate-conscious-data-center-cooling/\" target=\"_blank\">consume about 10 percent less energy</a> than air-cooled data centers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of servers immersed in a water tank for cooling purposes.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"33256\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-servers-immersed-in-a-water-tank-for-cooling-purposes.jpg?id=61560218&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In immersion cooling systems, servers are submerged in a fluid that carries heat away without evaporating water. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jason Alden/Bloomberg/Getty Images</small></p><p>In water-stressed regions, the priority should be low- to zero-water cooling systems to reduce direct use, while investing to add <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/renewable-energy\" target=\"_blank\">renewables</a> to the local grids to curb indirect water use and minimize carbon emissions from higher electricity demand. In wetter regions with carbon-intensive grids, priority should be given to reducing power use to lower the overall water consumption, even if that means continued use of evaporative cooling with its higher onsite water consumption.</p><p>The reality of the intertwined water and electricity systems forces data center operators to navigate tough trade-offs between global climate goals and local water needs. These choices often aren\u2019t simple, but until renewables dominate electricity grids, they may be unavoidable.</p><p><em>The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers or affiliated institutions.</em></p>"

Sixty percent longer than the biggest existing aircraft, with 12 times as much cargo space as a 747, the behemoth will look like an oil tanker that\u2019s sprouted wings\u2014aeronautical engineering at a preposterous scale.</p><p>Called WindRunner, and expected by 2030, it\u2019ll haul just one thing: massive wind-turbine blades. In most parts of the world, onshore wind-turbine blades can be built to a length of 70 meters, max. This size constraint comes not from the limits of blade engineering or physics; it\u2019s transportation. Any larger and the blades couldn\u2019t be moved over land, since they wouldn\u2019t fit through tunnels or overpasses, or be able to accommodate some of the sharper curves of roads and rails.</p><p>So the WindRunner\u2019s developer, <a href=\"https://radia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Radia</a> of Boulder, Colo., has staked its business model on the idea that the only way to get extralarge blades to wind farms is to fly them there. \u201cThe companies in the industry\u2026know how to make turbines that are the size of the Eiffel Tower with blades that are longer than a football field,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-lundstrom-aa848/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Lundstrom</a>, Radia\u2019s founder and CEO. \u201cBut they\u2019re just frustrated that they can\u2019t deploy those machines [on land].\u201d</p><p>Radia\u2019s plane will be able to hold two 95-meter blades or one 105-meter blade, and land on makeshift dirt runways adjacent to wind farms. This may sound audacious\u2014an act of hubris undertaken for its own sake. But Radia\u2019s supporters argue that WindRunner is simply the right tool for the job\u2014the only way to make onshore wind turbines bigger.</p><p>Bigger turbines, after all, can generate more energy at a lower cost per megawatt. But the question is: Will supersizing airplanes be worth the trouble?</p><h2>Wind Turbine Blade Transportation Challenges</h2><p>Lundstrom, an aerospace engineer, founded Radia nine years ago after coming across a plea for help from wind-turbine manufacturers. In their plea, posted as a press release, the manufacturers said they could build bigger onshore blades if there were simply a way to move them, Lundstrom recalls.</p><p>In the United States, for example, the height of interstate highway overpasses\u2014typically 4.9 meters (16 feet)\u2014won\u2019t allow for bigger turbine blades to pass. The overpass limitation is true for Europe too. There\u2019s more flexibility in the developing world, where there are fewer tunnels and overpasses generally, Lundstrom says. But many of the roads aren\u2019t paved or hardened, which makes it much tougher to move 50-tonne objects around.</p><p>Some regions in China don\u2019t have the same road constraints, allowing extralarge onshore wind turbines to be built there. Last year, Chinese multinational <a href=\"https://en.sanyre.com.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">Sany Renewable Energy</a> announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.sanyglobal.com/press_releases/3922/\" target=\"_blank\">installed a 15-megawatt model in Tongyu</a>, Jilin province, in northeast China, with blades that are 131 meters long. The blades were manufactured in an industrial park in Inner Mongolia, an 1,800-kilometer trek from where they were ultimately installed.</p><h3>The WindRunner</h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of a plane designed to transport large turbine blades, showcasing its unique features from a side view.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9b5ce\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-a-plane-designed-to-transport-large-turbine-blades-showcasing-its-unique-features-from-a-side-view.png?id=61574471&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/floating-offshore-wind-turbine\" target=\"_self\">Offshore wind farm developers</a> suffer from the logistical and practical challenges of operating in open ocean, but finding vessels big enough to transport the blades isn\u2019t one of those. The biggest offshore blades measure <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/energy/world-largest-offshore-wind-turbine-20-mw-mingyang/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 250 meters</a>, and they\u2019re usually transported via cargo ship. Manufacturers typically locate their facilities on the coast<strong>.</strong></p><p>Onshore, the movement of blades has met the hard limits of infrastructure. Shipping them in multiple pieces and reassembling them on-site won\u2019t work because the joints would create weak spots. Junctions would also add too much weight compared with that of blades made from single pieces of polymer, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-arent-27572/\" target=\"_blank\">Doug Arent</a>, executive director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Foundation and emeritus NREL researcher.</p><p>\u201cIt comes down to the stress engineering of the components,\u201d Arent says. Blades could one day be 3D-printed on-site, which could negate the need for an airplane, but that research is still in early stages, he says. (Lundstrom says 3D-printed blades will never happen, since it would require a large, sophisticated manufacturing facility to be built at every wind farm.)</p><p>If moving blades in pieces is folly, then the way forward is to fly. But even the largest existing cargo planes\u2014the C-5 and C-17 flown by the U.S. Air Force and the Russo-Ukrainian Antonov AN-124 Ruslan\u2014can\u2019t accommodate large turbine blades. \u201cThere really is no big cargo aircraft in production, or planned, except for ours,\u201d Lundstrom says.</p><h2>How to Make the World\u2019s Largest Aircraft Fly</h2><p>What you can experience of Radia\u2019s WindRunner today fits inside a conference room in the company\u2019s Boulder headquarters. Here, a kind of gazebo made of two-by-fours houses a flight simulator, where I\u2019m trying to virtually fly, and land, the behemoth.</p><p>There\u2019s a couple of pilot chairs, a joystick, a throttle, a video screen with a head-up display, and a few buttons to operate the simulated landing gear and wing flaps. The grid of flight instruments that will occupy the cockpit space above the pilot\u2019s head are not finished yet. Instead, laminated pictures of the eventual controls are Velcroed in place.</p><p>It takes surprisingly few levers and controls to fly the WindRunner. \u201cPhysics is physics,\u201d says my copilot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/etan-karni-aero/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Etan Karni</a>, principal engineer and head of Radia\u2019s advanced systems groups. As Karni controls the WindRunner\u2019s airspeed, I pull up on the joystick and guide it off the runway of a virtual Denver International Airport. A few minutes later I make a planned U-turn around a nearby lake. The maneuver is wobbly; I remind myself to move the joystick gently even though this is such a big bird.</p><h3>The WindRunner</h3><br /><img alt=\"Aerial diagram of WindRunner airplane design with annotated features on a field background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2d8ce\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/aerial-diagram-of-windrunner-airplane-design-with-annotated-features-on-a-field-background.png?id=61574317&amp;width=980\" /><p><br /></p><p>With Karni\u2019s aid in controlling the landing gear and flaps, we set down back in Denver. I not only keep the WindRunner in one enormous piece but also bring it to a stop at the very front of the runway, just before the visible streaks of burned rubber from other airliners.</p><p>In the real world, this remarkable feat of deceleration will enable the WindRunner to stop within 10 lengths of the aircraft\u2014about 1,080 meters. And the aircraft won\u2019t need the perfected runways of contemporary airports. It\u2019s designed, by necessity, to land on and take off from rugged dirt tracks\u2014like access roads on the perimeter of a wind farm, but wider.</p><p>These capabilities are enabled by the plane\u2019s relatively light weight, its wing and body shape, and its big tires. Optimized for cargo volume rather than mass\u2014because turbine blades are huge but not dense\u2014WindRunner is, effectively, one giant cargo hold with the bare minimum of amenities required to make it fly. \u201cLanding on dirt basically comes down to how many pounds per wheel you have,\u201d Lundstrom told me.</p><p>WindRunner\u2019s four jet engines will aid with short takeoffs. \u201cWhen the aircraft is empty,\u201d Lundstrom says, \u201cthe engines are so powerful that the vehicle has a thrust-to-weight ratio similar to early fighter jets.\u201d (Radia chose an engine already in use by modern airlines, but hasn\u2019t disclosed which one.)</p><p>To allow the plane to quickly turn skyward without scraping its underside, its back end will sweep away from the ground at a sharp angle. A single tail tall enough to stabilize the WindRunner would exceed airports\u2019 height limit of 24 meters, so Radia designed it with two risers in the shape of the letter <em><em>H</em></em>.</p><p>For landings, the aircraft\u2019s broad and stubby wings use their nearly 1,000-square-meter surface to catch air and decelerate quickly. Twenty big tires borrowed from the classic design of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s C-130 Hercules will help WindRunner slow down after it touches the ground.</p><p>The plane\u2019s mouth flips up to reveal its cavernous interior, a feature borrowed from the Antonov An-124. The cockpit, itself about as big as an entire Gulfstream private jet, looks like a pimple bulging from the WindRunner\u2019s staggering frame. It sticks out from the fuselage to avoid interfering with cargo space and is the only part of the plane designed for human habitation. During flight, the hold is only pressurized to about the level of the peak of Mt. Everest, to save energy.</p><h2>Why Wind Turbines Got Bigger</h2><p>During my visit to Radia, a virtual-reality headset lets me behold the colossus from underneath its wing and inside its cargo bay. It feels like standing next to a warehouse that can fly. Seeing the virtual superplane towering above, and grasping the plane\u2019s monumental scale makes me wonder if this adventure in engineering is necessary, that surely there\u2019s another way.</p><p>The largest helicopters built in the Western Hemisphere can carry up to 15 tonnes, but megablades can weigh four to five times that, Lundstrom notes. Blimps and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lta-research-airship-pathfinder-1\" target=\"_blank\">airships</a> can carry the weight, but they bring a laundry list of complications. They\u2019re too slow, need an expensive hangar to shield them from bad weather, require helium\u2014which is currently scarce\u2014and struggle to land when it\u2019s windy. \u201cAnd by the way, wind farms tend to be windy,\u201d he says.</p><p>And, since the world\u2019s biggest cargo planes can\u2019t be stretched to meet the length of a 100-meter blade, nor can they land on short, rugged runways, a new design is needed. Still, the fundamental question remains: Is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/bird-deaths-from-wind-turbines\" target=\"_blank\">increasing the size of onshore wind turbines</a> by 50 percent worth the trouble?</p><p><a href=\"https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/michael-f-howland/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Howland</a>, a wind-optimization expert at MIT, says there\u2019s a huge value proposition in it. A turbine\u2019s power-generation capacity increases by the cube of the wind speed blowing through it and the square of the diameter of the circle created by the spinning blades, he says. In other words, bigger turbines, while more expensive per individual unit, more than make up for it in generating capacity. That\u2019s why the size of turbines has grown steadily larger over the years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re able to have half as many,\u201d Lundstrom adds. \u201cSo even though the cost of each turbine has gone up, the cost per gigawatt goes way down.\u201d He estimates that GigaWind turbines would decrease the cost of energy by 20 to 35 percent while increasing output by 10 to 20 percent, potentially doubling wind\u2019s profitability even with the cost of all those flights included.</p><p>Having fewer total turbines means a wind farm could space them farther apart, avoiding airflow interference. The turbines would be nearly <a href=\"https://radia.com/wind-energy\" target=\"_blank\">twice as tall</a>, so they\u2019ll reach a higher, gustier part of the atmosphere. And big turbines don\u2019t need to spin as quickly, so they would make economic sense in places with average wind speeds around 5 meters per second compared with the roughly 7 m/s needed to sustain smaller units. \u201cThe result\u2026is more than a doubling of the acres in the world where wind is viable,\u201d Lundstrom says.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A rendering of the WindRunner aircraft on a dirt track in the desert next to a wind farm \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ddeee\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rendering-of-the-windrunner-aircraft-on-a-dirt-track-in-the-desert-next-to-a-wind-farm.png?id=61559596&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Upon the WindRunner\u2019s landing at a wind farm, rail equipment will roll turbine blades off the plane. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Radia</small></p><p>To kick-start this market, and to support the first WindRunners, Radia is developing a business arm that partners with wind-turbine manufacturers to develop new wind farms both domestically and internationally. WindRunners would deliver blades to those farms and those developed by other companies.</p><p>The scope of Radia\u2019s plan, and the ambition behind it, has impressed many observers, including Howland. \u201cI was both surprised but also very impressed by the innovative spirit of the idea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be ambitious in terms of solving the grand challenges.\u201d But onshore \u201cgigawind\u201d is full of unknowns, he notes. Less is understood about the flow physics and engineering of record-breaking turbine sizes. Plus, huge blades could create wakes so large that the turbines behind them would be noticeably affected by variations in air temperature and even the Coriolis effect caused by Earth\u2019s rotation, and might require innovation in fundamental science, he says.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the question of the big plane\u2019s carbon footprint. To move enough blades for a whole wind-farm operation, a WindRunner might fly back and forth from factory to farm every day for months, carrying one or two blades at a time. This may create more carbon emissions compared with trucking them. But Radia argues that the increased amount of clean energy created by advanced wind farms would be far more than enough to offset the CO<sub>2</sub> from the jet engines. Besides, the biggest component of a wind farm\u2019s carbon footprint is the concrete and steel. With longer blades allowing for fewer turbines to create the same amount of energy, carbon contributions should decrease, Lundstrom argues.</p><p>As Radia continues its quest, a dark cloud hangs over the endeavor. U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have made multiple attempts to grind the American wind-energy industry to a halt by pausing approvals, permits, and government loans. But Lundstrom pushes back against the notion that the prevailing winds out of Washington will clip Radia\u2019s wings. There\u2019s simply too much money to be made, he says.</p><p>\u201cMy belief is that [it\u2019ll] sort itself out\u2026.We\u2019ll be delivering [planes] at the end of this administration,\u201d Lundstrom says. Increasing the scale at which societies can produce wind power is crucial for a future without fossil fuels. And that scale, he says, can\u2019t be reached without a new airplane to make it possible. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"
