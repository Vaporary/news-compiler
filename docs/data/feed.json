        "summary": "We introduce an asset supply-and-demand approach to analyze the trajectory of US aggregate wealth, real interest rates, and fiscal sustainability. Our framework uses micro-founded and easy-to-implement sufficient statistics to quantify how shifts in demographics, inequality, and other forces affect asset market equilibrium. From 1950 to the present, rapid population aging, rising income inequality, increasing foreign demand for US assets, and declining productivity growth all contributed to a surge in asset demand. Asset supply initially fell, then turned around sharply, mainly driven by increases in government debt and the value of capitalized profits. Overall, asset demand won the race, and interest rates fell. Looking ahead to 2100, population aging will continue to strongly push up asset demand, but at current tax and benefit levels, asset supply will win the race, as rising entitlement costs push up government debt even more. While rising asset demand creates space for debt to eventually reach 250% of GDP without higher interest rates, stabilizing debt at any level requires a permanent fiscal adjustment of at least 10% of GDP."

Amazon plans to deploy the TM-Q in several major cities as part of its broader strategy to decarbonize last-mile delivery.</p><p>The TM-Q aims to solve one of the toughest challenges in urban logistics: moving heavy loads quickly through crowded city centers where trucks are inefficient and often unwelcome. Designed to slip through traffic and park in tight spaces, the vehicle lets couriers pedal with electric assist or switch to full battery power on steep hills. The TM-Q also cuts down on the emissions and noise that have made traditional vans a target of new <a href=\"https://www.volvotrucks.com/en-en/news-stories/insights/articles/2025/may/the-rise-of-low-emission-zones--what-you-need-to-know.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">low-emission-zone regulations</a> across Europe and the United States.</p><p>The project marks the first large-scale deployment of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/e-bikes\" target=\"_self\">pedal-assist</a> \u201cmicro-vans\u201d by a global logistics company\u2014a new middle ground between cargo bikes and delivery vans.</p><h2>Rivian\u2019s Micromobility Spin-off</h2><p>Also began as an internal Rivian project to explore how the company\u2019s EV expertise could extend into <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/future-shared-mobility\" target=\"_self\">micromobility</a>. It became an independent company in early 2025 with US $105 million in Series A funding from <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse Ventures</a>. Rivian retains a minority stake, and founder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rj-scaringe-58355716\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RJ Scaringe</a> sits on Also\u2019s board.</p><p>\u201cEverything we learned from the <a href=\"https://rivian.com/fleet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electric Delivery Van (EDV) program</a> was poured into this project,\u201d Scaringe said at the launch event in Oakland, Calif. That program allows Amazon to manage both Rivian\u2019s electric vans and Also\u2019s new quads through a shared fleet-management system\u2014a logistical advantage for a company already operating more than 25,000 Rivian EDVs worldwide.</p><p>All of Also\u2019s hardware and software are built in-house, using lessons from Rivian\u2019s vehicle architecture but with a separate supply chain, leadership team, and technology stack.</p><p>The TM-Q\u2019s pedal-by-wire powertrain merges human input with the same kind of safety-tested control logic found in full-size electric vehicles\u2014just scaled down for a bike. Torque and cadence sensors at the crank measure how hard and how fast the rider pedals. Those signals feed a controller that, within milliseconds, determines how much electric power to add from the rear-hub motor. The harder the rider pushes, the more assist the system provides\u2014up to legally defined limits (250 watts continuous in the EU and higher in the U.S.).</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWe\u2019re applying car-level engineering to machines that move through city bike lanes.\u201d <strong>\u2013Chris Yu, Also</strong> </p><p>Because the drivetrain is fully electronic, Also can tune the assist ratio through software updates\u2014a practice borrowed from Rivian\u2019s EV tuning. The system also applies <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/regenerative-braking\" target=\"_self\">regenerative braking</a>, recovering small amounts of energy to recharge the battery when slowing or stopping.</p><p>Power comes from a modular, swappable lithium-ion pack, light enough to be carried by hand. Standard packs offer roughly 538 watt-hours for up to112 kilometers (70 miles) of range, while larger 808 Wh packs extend that to 160 km (100 miles). Both versions support regenerative braking, which adds about 25 percent to effective range. Charging uses USB-C PD 3.1\u2014the latest major version of the <a href=\"https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd\" target=\"_blank\">USB Power Delivery</a> standard. The updated charging modality allows for faster, more efficient energy transfer (in this case, at up to 240 W), with communication between the charger and the battery meant to prevent issues such as overheating and thermal runaway that trigger fires. Also says the power packs are designed for bidirectional energy flow, meaning they can double as portable power banks.</p><p>Also is developing battery-dock swap stations so couriers can replace depleted packs in minutes instead of waiting for recharging\u2014key to keeping the e-bikes in motion during multi-shift operations.</p><p>The TM-Q includes a lockable cargo enclosure, logistics and charging-management software, and a 12.7-centimeter (5-inch) touchscreen for navigation and diagnostics. Amazon plans to service the quads through its network of more than 70 micromobility hubs across North America and Europe.</p><h2>Challenges in Scaling Pedal-Assist Quads</h2><p>Four-wheeled pedal-assist vehicles have been attempted before, but scaling them has proven difficult. In the European Union, pedal-assist quads under 250 watts often qualify as bicycles, but in the United States, they fall into a gray zone between e-bikes and light electric vehicles. Each state sets different speed and power limits, complicating large-scale deployment.</p><p>Also\u2019s approach is to adapt each regional configuration to fit local micromobility laws. The company\u2019s two main platforms illustrate this flexibility: the TM-Q, the quad built to provide near\u2013cargo van capacity but optimized for bike-lane compliance, and the two-wheeled TM-B, a consumer-focused pedal-assist e-bike with a top assisted speed of 45 km/h (28 mph). The TM-B has open seating for passengers or groceries and can be configured with other body styles built on the same chassis.</p><p>The company says both the TM-Q and TM-B are tested to automotive-grade reliability and safety standards, exceeding traditional e-bike durability benchmarks. Frames and electrical systems undergo vibration, impact, and water-resistance testing equivalent to that used to certify full-size EVs.</p><p>Also president <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-yu-2820778\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Yu</a> says the company is not just building bikes with motors. \u201cWe\u2019re applying car-level engineering to machines that move through city bike lanes.\u201d</p><p>The Amazon\u2013Also partnership reflects a broader industry shift toward \u201cright-sizing\u201d delivery fleets\u2014deploying the smallest, most efficient vehicle for each route. Cities including London, New York, and Paris are tightening restrictions on van access and idling, making compact electric vehicles not just environmentally beneficial but also regulatory necessities.</p><p>Also claims its TM series vehicles are 10 to 50 times as energy-efficient as local car or SUV trips, supporting cities\u2019 emissions-reduction goals without requiring new road infrastructure.</p><p>Initial production of the TM-Q is scheduled for early 2026, with final assembly in Taiwan, home to much of the world\u2019s high-end e-bike manufacturing. Several key components, including frames and subassemblies, are produced in the United States, says Also.</p><p>If the TM-Q delivers on its promise, city streets could soon trade four tons of steel for four wheels and a set of pedals\u2014reshaping last-mile delivery one bike lane at a time. </p>"

Execution is harder. Nearly every engineer has a colleague with a clever idea that never got past the whiteboard. The difference between wanting to act and actually taking action\u2014known as the<a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/intention-action-gap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>intention-action gap</em></em></a>\u2014is where entrepreneurship lives or dies.

Here are ways to reprogram your mindset.</p><ul><li><strong>Challenge the default.</strong> Engineers are taught to follow proven processes, but innovation often starts by asking, \u201cWhat if we did it differently?\u201d</li><li><strong>Balance the team.</strong> Innovative companies need a diverse mix of creative thinkers to generate ideas, entrepreneurs to drive execution, and managers to scale efficiently.</li><li><strong>Know your lane.</strong> Whether you\u2019re a visionary, a builder, or an optimizer, understanding your strengths can help you find the right collaborators.</li></ul><p>And, yes, timing matters.<a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Amazon</a> might have stayed just an online bookstore without the rise of e-commerce. The<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-founders-prioritize-the-problem\" target=\"_self\"> right idea at the wrong time</a> is likely to struggle. Start with current trends, for instance, AI offers extremely low entry barriers to get started, and everything is being built around it these days.</p><h2>An engineering attitude</h2><p>Entrepreneurial thinking isn\u2019t only for startup founders. It can mean championing a new process at your company, building an internal tool that changes how your team works, or bringing a product idea from sketch to launch. The<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/dalma-novaks-journey-to-entrepreneur\" target=\"_self\"> engineering mindset</a>\u2014systematic, detail-oriented, problem-solving\u2014is an asset that can power not just products but entire companies.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever thought: There\u2019s got to be a better way\u2014and if you felt the itch to make it real\u2014you might be closer to being an entrepreneur than you think.

Productivity comes from prioritization, and that meant he often said no to ideas and opportunities that he didn\u2019t think were important.</p><p>He frequently rejected projects that didn\u2019t align with his priorities.

You can see robots folding clothes <a href=\"https://x.com/MeRTcooking/status/1955551828038541662\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live at robotics expos</a>. Even before all this, Google showed clothes folding in their work, <a href=\"https://aloha-unleashed.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ALOHA unleashed</a>. <a href=\"https://7xr.tech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">7X Tech</a> is even planning to sell robots to fold clothes!</p><p>And besides folding actual clothes, there are other clothes-folding-like tasks, like Dyna\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/DynaRobotics/status/1940443709621109186\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">napkin folding</a>\u2014 which leads to what is probably my top <a href=\"https://www.dyna.co/dyna-1/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">robot video of the year</a>, demonstrating 18 hours of continuous napkin folding. So why are all of these robotic manipulation companies suddenly into folding?</p><h2> Reason 1: We basically couldn\u2019t do this before</h2><p>There\u2019s work <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6095109\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">going back over a decade</a> that shows some amount of robotic clothes folding. But these demonstrations were extremely brittle, extremely slow, and not even remotely production ready. Previous solutions existed (even learning based solutions!) but they relied on precise camera calibration, or on carefully hand-designed features, meaning that these clothes folding demos generally worked only on one robot, in one environment, and may have only ever worked a single time\u2014just enough for the recording of a demo video or paper submission.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A series of 6 stills show an older humanoid robot called a PR2 making efforts to fold a tshirt.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e3ffa\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-series-of-6-stills-show-an-older-humanoid-robot-called-a-pr2-making-efforts-to-fold-a-tshirt.jpg?id=62207442&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">With a little bit of help from a creatively patterned shirt, PR2 was folding things back in 2014.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6095109\" target=\"_blank\">Bosch/IEEE</a></small></p><p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pr2-close-to-completing-laundry-cycle\" target=\"_self\">this example</a> of UC Berkeley\u2019s PR2 <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/is-there-a-future-for-laundry-folding-robots\" target=\"_blank\">folding laundry</a> from 2014. This robot is, in fact, using a neural network policy. But that policy is very small and brittle; it picks and places objects against the same green background, moves very slowly, and can\u2019t handle a wide range of shirts. Making this work in practice would require larger models, pretrained on web-scale data, and better, more general techniques for imitation learning.</p><p>And so 10 years later, with the appropriate demonstration data, many different startups and research labs have been able to implement clothes-folding demos; it\u2019s something we have seen from numerous hobbyists and startups, using broadly similar tools (like <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot\" target=\"_blank\">LeRobot from HuggingFace</a>), without intense specialization.</p><h2>Reason 2: It looks great and people want it!</h2><p><span>Many of us who work in robotics have this \u2018north star\u2019 of a robot butler which can do all the chores we don\u2019t want to do. Mention clothes folding, and many, many people will chime in about how they don\u2019t ever want to fold clothes again and are ready to part with basically any amount of money to make that happen.</span><br /></p><p>This is important for the companies involved as well. Companies like Figure and 1x have been raising large amounts of money predicated on the idea that they will be able to automate many different jobs, but increasingly these companies seem to want to start in the home.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A robotic system with two robot arms with grippers on the end work in tandem to fold a white towel.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"86960\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-robotic-system-with-two-robot-arms-with-grippers-on-the-end-work-in-tandem-to-fold-a-white-towel.gif?id=62207449&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Dyna Robotics can fold an indefinite number of napkins indefinitely.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dyna Robotics</small></p><p>And that\u2019s part of the magic of these demos. While they\u2019re slow, and imperfect, everyone can start to envision how this technology becomes the thing that we all want: a robot that can exist in our house and mitigate all those everyday annoyances that take up our time.</p><h2>Reason 3: It avoids what robots are still bad at</h2><p>These robot behaviors are produced by models trained via imitation learning. Modern imitation learning methods like <a href=\"https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Diffusion Policy</a> use techniques inspired by generative AI to produce complex, dexterous robot trajectories, based on examples of expert human behavior that\u2019s been provided to them\u2014and they often need many, many trajectories. The work <a href=\"https://aloha-unleashed.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">ALOHA Unleashed</a> by Google is a great example, needing about 6,000 demonstrations to learn how to, for example, tie a pair of shoelaces. For each of these demonstrations, a human piloted a pair of robot arms while performing the task; all of this data was then used to train a policy.</p><p>We need to keep in mind what\u2019s hard about these demonstrations. Human demonstrations are never <em><em>perfect</em></em>, nor are they perfectly consistent; for example, two human demonstrators will never grab the <em><em>exact</em></em> same part of an object with sub-millimeter precision. That\u2019s potentially a problem if you want to screw a cover in place on top of a machine you\u2019re building, but it\u2019s not a problem at all for folding clothes, which is fairly forgiving. This has two knock-on effects:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s easier to collect the demonstrations you need for folding clothes, as you don\u2019t need to throw out every training demonstration that\u2019s a millimeter out of spec.</li><li>You can use cheaper, less repeatable hardware to accomplish the same task, which is useful if you suddenly need a fleet of robots collecting thousands of demos, or if you\u2019re a small team with limited funding!</li></ul><p>For similar reasons, it\u2019s great that with cloth folding, you can fix your cameras in just the right position. When learning a new skill, you need training examples with \u201ccoverage\u201d of the space of environments you expect to see at deployment time. So the more control you have, the more efficient the learning process will be\u2014the less data you\u2019ll need, and the easier it will be to get a flashy demo. Keep this in mind when you see a robot folding things on a plain tabletop or with an extremely clean background; that\u2019s not just nice framing, it helps the robot out a lot!</p><p>And since we\u2019ve committed to collecting a ton of data\u2014dozens of hours\u2014to get this task working well, mistakes will be made. It\u2019s very useful, then, if it\u2019s easy to <em><em>reset</em></em> the task, i.e. restore it to a state from which you can try the task again. If something goes wrong folding clothes, it\u2019s fine. Simply pick the cloth up, drop it, and it\u2019s ready for you to start over. This wouldn\u2019t work if, say, you were stacking glasses to put away in a cupboard, since if you knock over the stack or drop one on the floor, you\u2019re in trouble.</p><p>Clothes folding also avoids making forceful contact with the environment. Once you\u2019re exerting a lot of pressure, things can break, the task can become non-resettable, and demonstrations are often much harder to collect because forces aren\u2019t as easily observable to the policy. And every piece of variation (like the amount of force you\u2019re exerting) will end up requiring more data so the model has \u201ccoverage\u201d of the space it\u2019s expected to operate in.</p><h2>What To Look Forward To</h2><p>While we\u2019re seeing a lot of clothes-folding demos now, I still feel, broadly, quite impressed with many of them. As mentioned above, Dyna was one of my favorite demos this year, mostly because longer-running robot policies have been so rare until now. But they were able to demonstrate zero-shot folding (meaning folding without additional training data) at a couple of different conferences, including <a href=\"https://actuate.foxglove.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Actuate in San Francisco</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.corl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</a> in Seoul. This is impressive and actually very rare in robotics, even now.</p><p>In the future, we should hope to see robots that can handle more challenging and dynamic interactions with their environments: moving more quickly, moving heavier objects, and climbing or otherwise handling adverse terrain while performing manipulation tasks.</p><p>But for now, remember that modern learning methods will come with their own strengths and weaknesses. It seems that, while not easy, clothes folding is the kind of task that\u2019s just really well suited for what our models can do right now. So expect to see a lot more of it.</p>"

Today it\u2019s not difficult to go online and reserve a seat, but 65 years ago, travelers faced long queues at the ticket window and limited ways to find out if seats were available. Reservations were handwritten in a paper ledger, and there were plenty of accidental double-bookings. Travelers had no real way to know if they\u2019d have\u2014or could get\u2014a reservation once they reached a ticket window.</p><p>All that changed in 1960, when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_National_Railways\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese National Railways (JNR)</a>, which operated the country\u2019s system, partnered with technology company <a href=\"https://www.hitachi.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hitachi</a> to introduce the world\u2019s first fully automated railway booking system: the Magnetic-electronic Automatic Reservation System-1.</p><p><a href=\"https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:MARS-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MARS-1</a> gave JNR the ability to reserve up to 3,600 seats per day for travelers across four routes between Tokyo and Osaka. Bookings could be accepted up to 15 days in advance. Passengers no longer had to gamble on availability, because reservations were confirmed in seconds. Riders traveling in groups could even reserve seats next to each other, ensuring families could stay together during the journey.</p><p>The system has been commemorated as an <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Milestones:List_of_IEEE_Milestones\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Milestone</a> for its role in transforming railway ticketing in Japan, and even in other countries.</p><p>As of press time, the dedication ceremony was being planned.</p><h2>Introducing computers to Japan</h2><p>After the end of World War II, Japan\u2019s economy began to recover relatively quickly, thanks to sweeping <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_Doubling_Plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">economic reforms</a> that led to an industrial boom by the mid-1950s. Thanks in part to its economic growth, Japan invested heavily in its rail infrastructure, making trains more efficient and convenient for daily commuters and for long-distance travelers. As ridership soared, the inefficiency of the country\u2019s railroad ticketing system quickly became apparent.</p><p>JNR\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rtri.or.jp/eng/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research institute</a> took on the task of finding a solution. One of its engineers, <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/mamoru-hosaka/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mamoru Hosaka</a>, was already studying how computers could help automate certain tasks. Hosaka received the 2006 <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/pioneer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society Pioneer Award</a> for his work on what later became MARS-1.</p><p>In 1954 he successfully persuaded his colleagues and company executives to green-light a study into using computers to control railway systems, according to his Computer Society <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/mamoru-hosaka\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biography</a>.</p><p>Three years later, he shifted his focus and formed a team to investigate developing an automated reservation system using <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/memory-storage/8/252\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">magnetic drum memory</a> with a Bendix G-15 computer. Widely used in the 1950s and 1960s, magnetic drum memory stored information on the outside of a rotating cylinder coated with magnetic iron.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThe technical achievements of MARS-1 and its successors reached well beyond the railway. They were foundational to the development of real-time transaction systems that shape modern life.\u201d</p><p>Hosaka and his team designed a prototype system composed of custom control circuits that could rapidly retrieve and update seat information for four new express trains that connected Tokyo and Osaka. For each reservation, the system verified seat availability, issued confirmation slips, and updated the records\u2014all within seconds.</p><p>The design was handed off to engineers at Hitachi in Tokyo, who developed a working system\u2014MARS-1\u2014two years later. It was first installed in 1960 at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Station\" target=\"_blank\">Tokyo Station</a> and was one of the earliest large-scale deployments of a computerized system that captured, processed, and stored routine business transactions in real time.</p><p>Streamlining reservations made rail service more efficient and reliable, which was critical for workers, students, and families traveling between growing cities.</p><h2>Scaling up for the bullet train</h2><p>Although the launch of MARS-1 was regarded as a major success, the system quickly revealed its limitations. By 1964, Japan was preparing to launch the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/fast-trains-are-energy-efficient-and-fast\" target=\"_blank\">first high-speed rail line</a>\u2014the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shinkansen</a>\u2014(another <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Milestones:Tokaido_Shinkansen_(Bullet_Train),_1964\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Milestone</a>)\u2014known as the bullet train. The Shinkansen would reduce the travel time from Tokyo to Osaka from nearly seven hours to a little more than three. With the capacity for more trips per day, MARS-1\u2019s initial throughput of 3,600 daily bookings could no longer meet demand.</p><p>By October 1965, the upgraded MARS-102 system was installed in 152 stations across Japan. It consisted of three computers. The first searched trains, schedules, fares, and other tables. The second searched for and booked vacant seats. The third, and main computer, managed and controlled the system\u2019s overall processing sequence. The computers exchanged data using a shared magnetic core memory unit, according to the Information Processing Society of Japan\u2019s <a href=\"https://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/main/0006.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Museum website</a>.</p><p>The MARS-102 could process up to 150,000 seats, about five times more than the previous system. Engineers continued to make upgrades, and by 1991, the system supported daily sales of more than 1 million tickets.</p><h2>Inspiring reservation systems worldwide</h2><p>MARS-1\u2019s influence extended far beyond Japan. The system pioneered many of the principles that later underpinned global reservation systems. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(travel_reservation_system)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sabre</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Airlines</a> in the early 1960s, used similar real-time transaction concepts for airline reservations.</p><p>MARS-1 also paved the way for transaction-processing computers found in e-commerce, banking, and stock exchanges. Banks adopted comparable architectures for their ATM networks. Hotel chains developed automated room-booking platforms to process thousands of simultaneous transactions.</p><p>\u201cThe technical achievements of MARS-1 and its successors reached well beyond the railway,\u201d the <a href=\"https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:MARS-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Milestone proposers</a> wrote. \u201cThey were foundational to the development of real-time transaction systems that shape modern life.\u201d</p><h2>Recognition as an IEEE Milestone</h2><p>A plaque recognizing the MARS-1 as an IEEE Milestone is to be installed at the <a href=\"https://www.rtri.or.jp/eng/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Railway Technical Research Institute</a>, in Tokyo.

Sure, there were less-legit ways to get Apple software on off-brand hardware, and plenty of people were willing to try them. But there was a short period, roughly 36 months, when it was possible to get a licensed Mac that had the blessing of the team in Cupertino.</p><p>They called it the Mac clone era.

If you went into a CompUSA and bought a Mac, you were buying the full package, hardware and software, made by Apple. This had benefits and downsides. Because Apple charged a premium for its devices (unlike other vertical integrators, such as Commodore and Atari), it tended to relegate the company to a smaller part of the market. On the other hand, that product was highly polished.</p><p>That meant Apple needed to be good at two wildly disparate skill sets\u2014and protect others from stealing Apple\u2019s software prowess for their own cheaper hardware.</p><p>While historians can point to the rise of unofficial <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2017/05/04/apple-ii-clones-franklin-vtech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple II clones</a> in the \u201880s, and modern Apple fans can still technically build <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/04/08/hackintosh-proxmox-vm-experience/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hackintoshes</a> on Intel hardware, Apple\u2019s own Mac clone program came and went in just a few short years.</p><p>It was a painful lesson.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of an Outbound Notebook's RAM slots.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e29a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-an-outbound-notebook-s-ram-slots.jpg?id=62164700&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This Outbound Notebook wasn\u2019t sold with Apple features, but allowed users to insert a Mac ROM, a component that helped Apple limit cloning.

Apple, highly focused on vertical integration, used its ROM chips as a way to limit the flow of MacOS to potential clone-makers. This mostly worked, as the Mac\u2019s operating system was far more complex and harder to reverse-engineer than the firmware used by the IBM PC.</p><p>But plenty still tried. For example, <a href=\"https://lowendmac.com/2016/unitron-mac-512-a-contraband-mac-512k-from-brazil/\" target=\"_blank\">a Brazilian company named Unitron</a> sold a direct clone of the Macintosh 512K, which fell off the market only after a Brazilian trade body intervened. Later, a company named Akkord Technology attempted to sell a reverse-engineered device called the Jonathan, but ended up attracting <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/MacUser9007July1990/page/n49/mode/2up?q=Akkord+\" target=\"_blank\">a police raid</a> instead.</p><p>Somewhat more concerning for Apple\u2019s exclusivity: Early Macs shared much of their hardware architecture with other popular machines, particularly the <a href=\"https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/amax\" target=\"_blank\">Commodore Amiga</a> and <a href=\"https://www.atarimania.com/utility-atari-st-spectre-gcr_31462.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atari ST</a>, each of which received peripherals that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v4BaWwoyA0&amp;t=1s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introduced Mac software support</a> and made it easier to work across platforms.</p><p>But despite claims that this ROM-based approach was technically legal, it\u2019s not like any of this was explicitly allowed by Apple. At one point, <em><em>Infoworld</em></em> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=gjoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">responded to a letter to the editor</a> about this phenomenon with a curt note: \u201cApple continually reaffirms its intention to protect its ROM and to prevent the cloning of the Mac.\u201d </p><p>So what <em><em>was</em></em> Apple OK with? Full-on conversions, which took the hardware of an existing Mac, and rejiggered its many parts into an entirely new product. There are many examples of this throughout Apple\u2019s history\u2014such as the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/03/axiotron-modbook-tablet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ModBook</a>, a pre-iPad Mac tablet\u2014but the idea started with Chuck Colby.</p><p>Colby, an early PC clone-maker who was friends with Apple team members like Steve Wozniak, <a href=\"https://www.digibarn.com/friends/chuck-colby/mac-colby.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was already offering a portable Mac conversion</a> called the MacColby at one of the Mac\u2019s introductory events in 1984. (Apparently Apple CEO John Sculley bought two\u2014but never paid for them.)</p><p>One of Colby\u2019s later conversions, the semi-portable Walkmac, had earned a significant niche audience. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/walkmac-revisited-the-inside-story-of-the-first-portable-mac/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A 2013 <em><em>CNET</em></em> piece</a> notes that the rock band Grateful Dead and news anchor Peter Jennings were both customers, and that Apple would actually send Colby referrals.</p><p>So, why did Colby get the red-carpet treatment while other clone-makers were facing lawsuits and police raids? You still needed a Mac to do the aftermarket surgery, so Apple still got its cut. <span>One has to wonder: Would Apple have been better off just giving Chuck Colby, or any other interested party, a license to make their own clones? After all, it\u2019s not like Colby\u2019s ultra-niche portables were going to compete with Apple\u2019s experience. Right?</span></p><p>During the 1980s, this argument was basically a nonstarter\u2014the company even went so far as to change its dealer policy to limit the resale of its system ROMs for non-repair purposes. But by the 1990s, things were beginning to thaw.</p><p>You can thank a firm named NuTek for the nudge.<strong> </strong>The company, like Apple, was based in Cupertino, California, and it spent years talking up its reverse-engineering plans.</p><p>\u201cNutek will do for Mac users what the first IBM-compatible developers did in the early 1980s: open up the market to increased innovation and competition by enabling major independent third-party manufacture,\u201d explained Benjamin Chou, the company\u2019s CEO, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=7S6aSlz957QC&amp;pg=PA16\" target=\"_blank\">in a 1991 <em><em>ComputerWorld</em></em> piece</a>.</p><p>And by 1993, it had built a \u201cgood enough\u201d analogue of the Mac that could run most, but not all, Mac programs. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested the top 15 software applications and 13 of those worked,\u201d <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=cTwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chou told <em><em>InfoWorld</em></em></a>, an impressive boast until you hear the non-working apps are Microsoft Works and Excel.</p><p>It failed to make a splash, but NuTek\u2019s efforts nonetheless exposed a thaw in Apple\u2019s thinking. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9104_April_1991/page/n121/mode/2up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A 1991 <em><em>MacWorld</em></em> piece</a> on NuTek\u2019s reverse engineering attempt <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/MacWorld_9104_April_1991/page/n127/mode/2up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">quoted Apple Chief Operating Officer Michael Spindler</a> as saying, \u201cIt is not a question of whether Apple will license its operating system, but how it will do this.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Windows was finally making inroads in the market, and Apple was ready to bend.</p><h3>The moment Apple changed its mind about clones</h3><p>There was a time when it looked like MacOS was about to become a Novell product. Really. In 1992, Apple held very serious talks <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2021/03/24/novell-apple-macos-history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with the networking software provider</a> about selling, and it almost happened. ThenMichael Spindler became Apple\u2019s CEO in 1993 and killed the Novell experiment, but not the idea of licensing MacOS. It just needed the right partner.</p><p>It found one with Stephen Kahng\u2019s Power Computing. Kahng, a veteran of the clone wars, first made waves in the PC market with the clone-maker <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Jy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leading Edge</a>, and he wanted to repeat that feat with the Mac. And his new firm, Power Computing, was offering an inroad for Apple to potentially score similar success.</p><p>And so, in the waning days of 1994, just before the annual MacWorld conference, the news hit the wires: Apple was getting an authorized clone-maker. It turns out that the key was just to wait for the right CEO to take over, then ask nicely. </p><p>Though the idea may have looked rosy at first, some saw some dark clouds over the whole thing. Famed tech columnist John C. Dvorak suggested that Kahng was more dangerous than he seemed. \u201cApple is not going to know what hit them,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/29/business/for-apple-clones-and-competition.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told <em><em>The New York Times</em></em></a>.</p><p>And there were other signs that Apple was starting to lose its identity. A <em><em>PC Magazine</em></em> analysis from early 1995 perhaps put the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=79i1lfAqumUC&amp;pg=PA29\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biggest frowny-face</a> on the story:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Apple\u2019s decision to create a clone market may or may not be successful, but it didn\u2019t really have a choice. At the recent MacWorld conference, one of the most popular technical seminars was given by Microsoft. It covered how Mac programmers can learn to write Windows applications.</p><p>One can see why Apple might have been attracted to this model, in retrospect. The company was a bit lost in the market at the time, and needed a strategy to expand its shrinking base of users.</p><p>But the clone market did not expand its base. Instead, it invited a price war.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A PowerComputing PowerCenter Pro 210 running Mac OS 7.6.1\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d6523\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-powercomputing-powercenter-pro-210-running-mac-os-7-6-1.jpg?id=62164712&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A PowerCenter Pro 210, a Macintosh clone manufactured by Power Computing Corporation.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angelgreat/Wikimedia Commons</small></p><h3>Why licensed Mac clones didn\u2019t work</h3><p>The best time for Apple to introduce a clone program was probably a decade earlier, in 1985 or 1986. At the time, people like Chuck Colby were inventing new kinds of Macs that didn\u2019t directly compete with what Apple was making. Furthermore, the concept of a Mac was new, just as desred for its form factor as its software. </p><p>In hindsight, it\u2019s clear that 1995 <em><em>wasn\u2019t</em></em> a good time to do so. The decision put a mirror against Apple\u2019s own offerings, which attempted to hit every possible market segment\u201447 different device variants that year alone, per <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/macs-released-in-1995.html\" target=\"_blank\">EveryMac</a>.</p><p>This didn\u2019t reflect well on Apple\u2014and companies like Power Computing exploited that to offer cheaper hardware. The company\u2019s Power 100, for example, scored basically identical performance to the Macintosh 8100/100, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=aS7TOePnRDAC&amp;pg=PA48\" target=\"_blank\">while cutting more than US $1,000</a> off the Apple product\u2019s $4,400 price tag. Meanwhile, other machines, such as the <a href=\"https://lowendmac.com/1995/daystar-genesis-mp/\" target=\"_blank\">DayStar Genesis MP</a>, outpaced Apple\u2019s own ability to hit the high end. </p><p>Both of these machines, in their own ways, hit at a key problem with Apple\u2019s mid-\u201990s industrial design. Before the iMac revolutionized Apple computers upon its 1998 release, Macs simply didn\u2019t have enough of a \u201cwow factor\u201d driving the industrial design. It made the Mac about the software, not the hardware.</p><p>Within a year or two, it was clear that Apple had begun to undermine its own bottom line. When Chuck Colby put a Mac motherboard in a new chassis, Apple kept its high margins. But Power Computing\u2019s beige boxes ate into Apple\u2019s market share, and the MacOS-makers also got a far smaller cut.</p><p><span>There likely was a magic point at which Power Computing\u2019s scale would have made up for the loss in hardware revenue. But in the era of Windows 95, Apple needed a partner that would go toe-to-toe with Packard Bell. Instead, these cut-rate Macs only attracted the already converted, undercutting Apple along the way.</span></p><p>\u201cI would guess that somewhere around 99 percent of their sales went to the existing customer base,\u201d then-CFO Fred Anderson <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1997/09/apple-kills-clone-market/\" target=\"_blank\">told <em><em>Wired</em></em> in 1997</a>.</p><p>The company only figured this part out after Steve Jobs returned to the fold.</p><h3>Apple\u2019s retreat from cloning</h3><p>The course correction got messy: Jobs, in the midst of trying to fix this situation in his overly passionate way, might have harmed the evolution of the PowerPC chip, for example. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB892507589126559000?st=SGhrTb&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\">A 1998 piece</a> from the <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em> notes that Jobs\u2019 tough negotiations over clones damaged its relationship with Motorola, its primary CPU supplier, to the point the company pledged it would no longer go the extra mile for Apple.</p><p>\u201cThey will be just another customer,\u201d a Motorola employee told the paper.</p><p>Power Computing\u2014which had an apparent <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=HOYtntaY99UC&amp;pg=PA242\" target=\"_blank\">$500 million in revenue</a> in 1996 alone\u2014got a somewhat softer landing, though not without its share of drama. Apple had pushed the company to agree to a new licensing deal even before Jobs took over as CEO, and once he did, it was clear the companies would not see eye to eye. The company\u2019s then-president, Joel Kocher, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1997/08/power-computing-rank-and-file-grow-restless/\" target=\"_blank\">attempted to take the battle to MacWorld</a>, where he forced a public confrontation over the issue. The board disagreed with Kocher\u2019s actions, Kocher quit, and ultimately the company <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/apple-purchases-power-computing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sold most of its assets</a> to Apple for $100 million, effectively killing the market entirely.</p><p>The only clone-maker that Apple seemed willing to play ball with was the company UMAX. The reason? Its SuperMac line had figured out how to hit the low-end market, an area Apple has famously struggled to hit. Apple wanted UMAX to focus on the sub-$1,000 market, especially in parts of the world where Apple lacks a foothold. But UMAX didn\u2019t want the low-end if it couldn\u2019t keep a foothold in the more lucrative high end, and it chose to dip out on its own. </p><p>The situation highlighted the ultimate problems with cloning\u2014a loss of control, and a lack of alignment between licensor and licensee.</p><p>Apple restricted the licenses, making these System 7 clones, for the most part, restricted from (legally) upgrading to Mac OS 8. It did the trick\u2014and starved the clone-makers out.</p><h3>The one time Steve Jobs flirted with a Mac clone</h3><p>That would be the end of the Apple clone story, except for one dangling thread: Steve Jobs once attempted to make an exception to his aversion to clones.<span>In the early 2000s, Jobs pitched Sony on the idea of putting Mac OS X on its VAIO desktops and laptops, essentially because he felt it was the only product line that matched what Apple was doing from a visual standpoint.</span></p><p>Jobs looked up to Sony and its cofounder Morita Akio, even offering a eulogy for Akio after his passing. (<a href=\"https://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00010/\" target=\"_blank\">Nippon</a>, upon Jobs\u2019 passing, called the Apple founder\u2019s appreciation for the country and its companies \u201ca reciprocal love affair.\u201d) But Sony had already done the work with Windows, so <a href=\"https://nobi.com/en/Steve%20Jobs%20and%20Japan/entry-1212.html\" target=\"_blank\">it wasn\u2019t to be</a>. </p><p>On Sony\u2019s part, it sounds like the kind of prudent decision Jobs made when he killed the clones a few years earlier.</p>"

Its GPUs powered search engines, video apps, smartphones, electric vehicles, and the current wave of generative AI models. Even as Washington tightened export rules for advanced AI chips, Chinese companies kept settling for and buying \u201cChina-only\u201d Nvidia chips stripped of their most advanced features\u2014H800, A800, and H20.</p><p><span>But by 2025, patience in Beijing had seemingly snapped. State media began labeling Nvidia\u2019s China-compliant H20 as <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3321411/nvidias-h20-chips-face-growing-chinese-distrust-over-alleged-back-doors-15-revenue-deal\" target=\"_blank\">unsafe and possibly compromised with hidden \u201cbackdoors.\u201d</a> Regulators <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3320240/chinas-cyberspace-regulator-summons-nvidia-explain-h20-chips-alleged-back-door-risks\" target=\"_blank\">summoned</a> company executives for questioning, while reports from <em>The Financial Times</em> surfaced that tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12adf92d-3e34-428a-8d61-c9169511915c\" target=\"_blank\">quietly told to cancel new Nvidia GPU orders.</a> The Chinese AI startup DeepSeek also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/deepseek-hints-latest-model-supported-by-chinas-next-generation-homegrown-ai-chips.html\" target=\"_blank\">signaled</a> in August that its next model will be designed to run on China\u2019s \u201cnext-generation\u201d domestic AI chips.</span></p><p><span>The message was clear: China could no longer bet its AI future on an U.S. supplier. If Nvidia wouldn\u2019t\u2014or couldn\u2019t\u2014sell its best hardware in China, domestic alternatives must fill the void by designing specialized chips for both AI training (building models) and AI inference (running them).</span></p><p>That\u2019s difficult\u2014in fact, some say it\u2019s impossible. Nvidia\u2019s chips set the global benchmark for AI computing power. Matching them requires not just raw silicon performance but memory, interconnection bandwidth, software ecosystems, and above all, production capacity at scale.</p><p>Still, a few contenders have emerged as China\u2019s best hope: Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, and Cambricon. Each tells a different story about China\u2019s bid to reinvent its AI hardware stack.</p><h2>Huawei\u2019s AI Chips Are in the Lead</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"People at an AI conference stop to look at a display of servers that stretches across the room. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6d9d5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/people-at-an-ai-conference-stop-to-look-at-a-display-of-servers-that-stretches-across-the-room.jpg?id=62132455&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Huawei is betting on rack-scale supercomputing clusters that pool thousands of chips together for massive gains in computing power. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">VCG/Getty Images</small></p><p>If Nvidia is out, Huawei, one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, looks like the natural replacement. Its Ascend line of AI chips has matured under the U.S. sanctions, and in September 2025 the company laid out a multi-year public roadmap:</p><ul><li>Ascend 950, expected in 2026 with a performance target of 1 petaflop in the low-precision FP8 format that\u2019s commonly used in AI chips. It will have 128 to 144 gigabytes of on-chip memory, and interconnect bandwidths (a measure of how fast it moves data between components) of up to 2 terabytes per second.</li><li>Ascend 960, expected in 2027, is projected to double the 950\u2019s capabilities.</li><li>Ascend 970 is further down the line, and promises significant leaps in both compute power and memory bandwidth.</li></ul><p>The current offering is the Ascend 910B, introduced after U.S. sanctions cut Huawei off from global suppliers. Roughly comparable to the A100, Nvidia\u2019s top chip in 2020, it became the de facto option for companies who couldn\u2019t get Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. One Huawei official even claimed the 910B outperformed the A100 by around 20 percent in some training tasks in 2024. But the chip still relies on an older type of <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/leashing-chinese-ai-needs-smart-chip-controls.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">high-speed memory (HBM2E)</a>, and can\u2019t match Nvidia\u2019s H20: It holds about a third less data in memory and transfers data between chips about 40 percent more slowly.</p><p><span>The company\u2019s latest answer is the 910C, a dual-chiplet design that fuses two 910Bs. In theory, it can approach the performance of Nvidia\u2019s H100 chip (Nvidia\u2019s flagship chip until 2024); Huawei showcased a 384-chip Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD cluster that reached roughly 300 Pflops of compute, implying that each 910C can deliver just under 800 teraflops when performing calculations in the FP16 format. That\u2019s still shy of the H100\u2019s roughly 2,000 Tflops, but it\u2019s enough to train large-scale models if deployed at scale. </span>In fact, Huawei has detailed how they used Ascend AI chips to train DeepSeek-like models.</p><p>To address the performance gap at the single-chip level, Huawei is betting on rack-scale supercomputing clusters that pool thousands of chips together for massive gains in computing power. Building on its Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD, the company plans to launch the Atlas 950 SuperPoD in 2026, linking 8,192 Ascend chips to deliver 8 exaflops of FP8 performance, backed by 1,152 TB of memory and 16.3 petabytes per second of interconnect bandwidth. The cluster will span a footprint larger than two full basketball courts. Looking further ahead, Huawei\u2019s Atlas 960 SuperPoD is set to scale up to 15,488 Ascend chips.</p><p>Hardware isn\u2019t Huawei\u2019s only play. Its MindSpore deep learning framework and lower-level CANN software are designed to lock customers into its ecosystem, offering a domestic alternative to PyTorch (a popular framework from Meta) and CUDA (Nvidia\u2019s platform for programming GPUs) respectively.</p><p>State-backed firms and U.S.-sanctioned companies like iFlytek, 360, and SenseTime have already signed on as Huawei clients. The Chinese tech giants ByteDance and Baidu also ordered small batches of chips for trial.</p><p>Yet Huawei isn\u2019t an automatic winner. Chinese telecom operators such as China Mobile and Unicom, which are also responsible for building China\u2019s data centers, remain wary of Huawei\u2019s influence. They often prefer to mix GPUs and AI chips from different suppliers rather than fully commit to Huawei. Big internet platforms, meanwhile, worry that partnering too closely could hand Huawei leverage over their own intellectual property.</p><p>Even so, Huawei is better positioned than ever to take on Nvidia.</p><h2>Alibaba Pushes AI Chips to Protect Its Cloud Business</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A tall server rack has the words Alibaba Cloud Server Panjiu AI Infra 2.0 written at the top.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2111f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-tall-server-rack-has-the-words-alibaba-cloud-server-panjiu-ai-infra-2-0-written-at-the-top.jpg?id=62132469&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Alibaba Cloud\u2019s business depends on reliable access to training-grade AI chips.

Today, it\u2019s emerging as one of China\u2019s most aggressive bids to compete with Nvidia.</p><p>T-Head\u2019s first AI chip is the Hanguang 800 chip, an efficient chip designed for AI inference that was announced in 2019; it\u2019s able to process 78,000 images per second and optimize recommendation algorithms and large language models (LLMs). Built on a 12-nanometer process with around 17 billion transistors, the chip can perform up to 820 trillion operations per second (TOPS) and access its memory at speeds of around 512 GB per second.</p><p>But its latest design\u2014the PPU chip\u2014is something else entirely. Built with 96 GB of high-bandwidth memory and support for high-speed PCIe 5.0 connections, the PPU is pitched as a direct rival to Nvidia\u2019s H20.</p><p>During a state-backed television program featuring a China Unicom data center, the PPU was presented as capable of rivaling Nvidia\u2019s H20. Reports suggest this data center runs over 16,000 PPUs out of 22,000 chips in total. <em>The Information</em> also reported that Alibaba has been <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/alibaba-baidu-adopt-ai-chips-major-shift-chinese-tech\" target=\"_blank\">using its AI chips</a> to train LLMs.</p><p>Besides chips, Alibaba Cloud lately also upgraded its supernode server, named <a href=\"https://x.com/poezhao0605/status/1970782067958149414\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Panjiu</span></a>, which now features 128 AI chips per rack, modular design for easy upgrades, and fully liquid cooling.</p><p>For Alibaba, the motivation is as much about cloud dominance as national policy.

Fabricated on a 7-nm node, it pushed performance to 256 TOPS for low-precision INT8 calculations and 128 Tflops for FP16, all while reducing power to about 120 watts. Baidu aimed this second generation less at training and more at inference-heavy tasks such as its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tesla-robotaxi-chinese-competitors\" target=\"_self\">Apollo autonomous cars</a> and Baidu AI Cloud services. Also in 2021, Baidu spun off Kunlun into an independent company called Kunlunxin, which was then valued at US $2 billion.</p><p><span>For years, little surfaced about Kunlun\u2019s progress. But that changed dramatically in 2025. At its developer conference, Baidu unveiled a 30,000-chip cluster powered by its third-generation P800 processors. Each P800 chip, according to research by Guosen Securities, reaches roughly 345 Tflops at FP16, putting it in the same level as Huawei\u2019s 910B and Nvidia\u2019s A100. Its interconnect bandwidth is reportedly close to Nvidia\u2019s H20. Baidu pitched the system as capable of training \u201cDeepSeek-like\u201d models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Baidu\u2019s latest multimodal models, the Qianfan-VL family of models with 3 billion, 8 billion, and 70 billion parameters, were all trained on its Kunlun P800 chips.</span></p><p>Kunlun\u2019s ambitions extend beyond Baidu\u2019s internal demands. This year, Kunlun chips secured orders worth over 1 billion yuan (about $139 million) for China Mobile\u2019s AI projects. That news helped restore investor confidence: Baidu\u2019s stock is up 64 percent this year, with the Kunlun reveal playing a central role in that rise.</p><p>Just today, Baidu <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/11/13/news-baidu-rolls-out-kunlun-roadmap-m100-m300-ai-chips-arrive-2026-2027/\" target=\"_blank\">announced its roadmap for its AI chips</a>, promising to roll out a new product every year for the next five years. In 2026, the company will launch the M100, optimized for large-scale inference, and in 2027 the M300 will arrive, optimized for training and inference of massive multimodal models. Baidu hasn\u2019t yet released details about the chips\u2019 parameters.</p><p><span>Still, challenges loom. Samsung has been Baidu\u2019s foundry partner from day one, producing Kunlun chips on advanced process nodes. Yet reports from Seoul suggest Samsung has paused production of <a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/08/01/ETCXKAQ7GFDPNLZBZTTGHZTR3A/\" target=\"_blank\">Baidu\u2019s 4-nm</a> designs.</span></p><h2>Cambricon\u2019s Chip Moves Make Waves in the Stock Market</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A closeup shows a small silver and black chip with the word Cambricon at the top.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bf8ef\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-closeup-shows-a-small-silver-and-black-chip-with-the-word-cambricon-at-the-top.jpg?id=62132486&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cambricon struggled in the early 2020s, with chips like the MLU 290 that couldn\u2019t compete with Nvidia chips. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images</small></p><p>The chip company Cambricon is probably the best performing publicly traded company on China\u2019s domestic stock market. Over the past 12 months, Cambricon\u2019s share price has jumped nearly 500 percent.</p><p>The company was officially spun out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016, but its roots stretch back to a 2008 research program focused on brain-inspired processors for deep learning. By the mid-2010s, the founders believed AI-specific chips were the future.</p><p>In its early years, Cambricon focused on accelerators called neural processing units (NPUs) for both mobile devices and servers. Huawei was a crucial first customer, licensing Cambricon\u2019s designs for its Kirin mobile processors. But as Huawei pivoted to develop its own chips, Cambricon lost a flagship partner, forcing it to expand quickly into edge and cloud accelerators. Backing from Alibaba, Lenovo, iFlytek, and major state-linked funds helped push Cambricon\u2019s valuation to $2.5 billion by 2018 and eventually landing it on Shanghai\u2019s Nasdaq-like STAR Market in 2020.</p><p>The next few years were rough. Revenues fell, investors pulled back, and the company bled cash while struggling to keep up with Nvidia\u2019s breakneck pace. For a while, Cambricon looked like another cautionary tale of Chinese semiconductor ambition. But by late 2024, fortunes began to change. The company returned to profitability, thanks in large part to its newest MLU series of chips.</p><p>That product line has steadily matured. The MLU 290, built on a 7-nm process with 46 billion transistors, was designed for hybrid training and inference tasks, with interconnect technology that could scale to clusters of more than 1,000 chips. The follow-up MLU 370, the last version before Cambricon was sanctioned by the United States government in 2022, can reach 96 Tflops at FP16.</p><p>Cambricon\u2019s real deal came with the MLU 590 in 2023. The 590 was built on 7-nm and delivered peak performance of <a href=\"https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20250826A08Y4I00\" target=\"_blank\"><span>345 Tflops at FP16</span></a>, with some reports suggesting it could even surpass Nvidia\u2019s H20 in certain scenarios. Importantly, it introduced support for less-precise data formats like FP8, which eased memory bandwidth pressure and boosted efficiency. This chip didn\u2019t just mark a leap\u2014it turned Cambricon\u2019s finances around, restoring confidence that the company could deliver commercially viable products.</p><p>Now all eyes are on the MLU 690, currently in development. Industry chatter suggests it could approach, or even rival, Nvidia\u2019s H100 in some metrics. Expected upgrades include denser compute cores, stronger memory bandwidth, and further refinements in FP8 support. If successful, it would catapult Cambricon from \u201cdomestic alternative\u201d status to a genuine competitor at the global frontier.</p><p>Cambricon still faces hurdles: its chips aren\u2019t yet produced at the same scale as Huawei\u2019s or Alibaba\u2019s, and past instability makes buyers cautious. But symbolically, its comeback matters. Once dismissed as a struggling startup, Cambricon is now seen as proof that China\u2019s domestic chip path can yield profitable, high-performance products.</p><h2>A Geopolitical Tug-of-War</h2><p>At its core, the battle over Nvidia\u2019s place in China isn\u2019t really about teraflops or bandwidth. It\u2019s about control. Washington sees chip restrictions as a way to protect national security and slow Beijing\u2019s advance in AI. Beijing sees rejecting Nvidia as a way to reduce strategic vulnerability, even if it means temporarily living with less powerful hardware.</p><p>China\u2019s big four contenders, Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, and Cambricon, along with other smaller players such as Biren, Muxi, and Suiyuan, don\u2019t yet offer the real substitutes. Most of their offerings are barely comparable with A100, Nvidia\u2019s best chips five years ago, and they are working to catch up with H100, which was available three years ago.</p><p>Each player is also bundling its chips with proprietary software and stacks. This approach could force Chinese developers accustomed to Nvidia\u2019s CUDA to spend more time adapting their AI models which, in turn, could affect both training and inference.</p><p>DeepSeek\u2019s development of its next AI model, for example, has reportedly been delayed. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb984646-6320-4bfe-a78d-a1da2274b092\" target=\"_blank\"><span>The primary reason</span></a> appears to be the company\u2019s effort to run more of its AI training or inference on Huawei\u2019s chips.</p><p>The question is not whether Chinese companies can build chips\u2014they clearly can. The question is whether and when they can match Nvidia\u2019s combination of performance, software support, and trust from end-users. On that front, the jury\u2019s still out.</p><p>But one thing is certain: China no longer wants to play second fiddle in the world\u2019s most important technology race.</p>"

A particular darling of that coverage was the use of 3D-printing for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-hand-design\" target=\"_blank\">prosthetic limbs</a>: For example, i<span>n 2015, <em>The New York Times </em>celebrated the US $15 to $20 3D-printed prosthetic hands facilitated by the nonprofit <a href=\"https://enablingthefuture.org/\" target=\"_blank\">E-nable</a>, which paired hobbyist 3D printer owners with children with limb differences. The magic felt undeniable: disabled children could get cheap, freely accessible mechanical hands made by a neighbor with an unusual hobby. Similar stories about prosthetics abounded, painting a picture of an emerging high-tech utopia enabled by a technology straight out of <em>Star Trek</em>. </span></p><p><span>But as so often happens, the <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner Hype Cycle </a>was in full force. By the mid-2010s, 3D-printing was in the \u201cPeak of Inflated Expectations\u201d phase, and prosthetics was no exception. Those LEGO-style hands getting media attention didn\u2019t have the strength needed for a wearable device, the prints themselves had too many inaccuracies, and the designs were\u2014as you may imagine an entirely plastic object to be\u2014deeply uncomfortable.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of Quorum's 3D-printed prostheses socket.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8fce8\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-quorum-s-3d-printed-prostheses-socket.jpg?id=62149737&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Quorum\u2019s 3D-printed prostheses socket.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Quorum</small></p><p>The so-called \u201cTrough of Disillusionment\u201d followed. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-johnson-07413b216/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Johnson</a>, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.quorumprosthetics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quorum Prosthetics</a> in Windsor, Colorado, saw prosthetists shy away from 3D printing technologies for years. Johnson stuck it out, though, waiting for  technology and bureaucracy to catch up to his ambition. A milestone happened last year when U.S. medical insurers released an \u201cL-code\u201d specifically for adjustable sockets for prosthetic limbs. An L-code allows durable medical equipment\u2014such as prosthetics\u2014to be handled for billing within the U.S. insurance system. <span>Quorum\u2019s engineers responded with a sophisticated, adjustable socket utilizing 3D printing. Quorum\u2019s design can adjust both volume and compression on residual limbs, making a better fit, like tightening your shoe laces.</span></p><p>Despite its high-tech and sleek appearance, Johnson says his socket <em>could</em> be made using traditional methods. But 3D printing makes it a \u201cbit better and easier.\u201d \u201cWhen you look at overall cost of labor,\u201d says Johnson, \u201cit just keeps going up. To manufacture one of our sockets would take a technician 12 or 16 hours to make [using traditional methods].\u201d Using 3D printing, he says \u201cwe can make five overnight.\u201d As a result, Quorum spends less on technician labor.</p><p>However, there are new costs. Quorum needs to pay for software subscriptions and licenses on top of the overhead required to operate a nearly one-million dollar Hewlett-Packard 3D printer. \u201cWe have to spend $50,000 on the A/C unit just to control the humidity,\u201d says Johnson. At the end of the day, it costs over $1000 to print each socket, even when they print multiple sockets together. The costs are actually now higher than if Quorum didn\u2019t use 3D printing to manufacture prostheses, but Johnson believes the quality is superior. \u201cYou can see more patients. [3D printing] is so precise and less adjustments need to be made.\u201d This has meant fewer follow-up visits for patients and, for many, better fits.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A doctor adjusting a prosthetic liner on their seated patient's leg.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30aab\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-doctor-adjusting-a-prosthetic-liner-on-their-seated-patient-s-leg.jpg?id=62149626&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Operation Namaste is using 3D printing to standardized the liners for prosthetic limb sockets.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Operation Namaste</small></p><h2>Why hasn\u2019t 3D printing lowered costs?</h2><p>When I asked <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-erenstone-439145140/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Erenstone,</a> a prosthetist for over two decades and founder of prosthetic limb non-profit <a href=\"https://www.operationnamaste.org/copy-of-what-we-do\" target=\"_blank\">Operation Namaste,</a> why 3D printed designs hadn\u2019t lowered costs, he said Quorum is \u201cable to make a socket that was not possible before 3D printing\u2014very next level socket and sophistication. What they are making isn\u2019t lowering costs any more than Ferrari is lowering costs. They are making the Ferrari of sockets.\u201d</p><p>But Erenstone says the technology is finally getting closer to achieving some of the things everyone imagined was possible ten years ago. Namely, the ability to share designs around the world and increase communication between practitioners has been life-changing. Ernestone set his sights on cracking the code around prosthetic liners\u2014the silicone, flexible socks that prosthesis-users roll up onto their residual limb before inserting it into the prosthesis socket. Liners from one of the most common brands, <a href=\"https://www.ossur.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Ossur</a>, are sold for many hundreds of dollars each, but are vital for a prosthetic to be comfortable enough to wear all day. To bring high quality liners to prosthesis-users in low-resourced countries, Operation Namaste is standardizing the molds to make silicone liners. Clinicians anywhere in the world can print the mold using inexpensive 3D printers and about $22 in materials and local labor costs to produce a high-quality silicone liner. \u201c3D printing has value in low income countries because accessibility is so much harder,\u201d explains Erenstone. \u201cI have not seen it [have as much value] in the urban areas where there is adequate prosthetic care.\u201d</p><p>3D printing has been especially helpful in war zones such as Ukraine and Sudan, where it may be unsafe for prosthetists to visit from abroad and there are very few resources. Canada-based <a href=\"https://www.victoriahandproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Victoria Hand Project </a>identifies prosthetics and orthotics clinics around the world, sets them up with a 3D print lab, and trains the clinicians in 3D printing software. Where 3D printing has made a difference is increasing knowledge sharing between practitioners and increasing the availability of low-cost designs. It is unclear, however, whether prosthetics printed with cheaper 3D printers hold up compared to conventional time-tested, body-powered, low-cost designs. Quorum Prosthetics operates a nonprofit called <a href=\"https://www.onelegatatime.net/about\" target=\"_blank\">One Leg at a Time </a>in Tanzania, where they train local people in 3D scanning and measuring of residual limbs, but these scans are sent back to Colorado, where an industrial multi-jet fusion printer actually prints the hands. Local Tanzanians may be trained to use the new technology, but the best equipment to finish the task is still out of their reach.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of Unlimited Tomorrow's prosthetic hand, which has intricate hinges resembling the bone structure of a human hand.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f5c7b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-unlimited-tomorrow-s-prosthetic-hand-which-has-intricate-hinges-resembling-the-bone-structure-of-a-human-hand.jpg?id=62149566&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Unlimited Tomorrow\u2019s TrueLimb</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Unlimited Tomorrow</small></p><h2>Can 3D-printed prosthetics be cheaper?</h2><p>The goal of using 3D printing to make prosthesis less expensive is still being pursued, but non-technical issues pose significant obstacles<span>. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/easton-lachappelle-8a373299/\" target=\"_blank\">Easton LaChapelle</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.unlimitedtomorrow.com/truelimb/\" target=\"_blank\">Unlimited Tomorrow,</a> sought to leverage 3D printing\u2014a technology he fell in love with as a teenager\u2014to create a high-functioning, low-cost hand to rival the clunky multi-articulating prosthetic hands on the market. The result was the TrueLimb, a $7,000  prosthetic hand so intricate in its appearance it looks as if it was carved from wood. The TrueLimb was sold directly to consumers in an effort to bypass the headaches of medical insurance, but even at $7,000\u2014about 1/10th the cost of other multi-articulating <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4968852/\" target=\"_blank\">myoelectric hands</a>\u2014the hand proved too expensive for many. Customers approached LaChapelle and asked for them to take insurance. Unlimited Tomorrow then started working with prosthetists who had to decide between billing insurance companies for (for example) a German-made prosthetic hand for tens of thousands of dollars versus the TrueLimb. \u201cProsthetists were hesitant to work with us because our price point was so low, they couldn\u2019t mark it up to what they are used to,\u201d explains LaChapelle. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the technology is in these circumstances. Unlimited Tomorrow could have produced the best device, but clinicians are like \u2018why would I bill for a TrueLimb when I could bill a <a href=\"https://www.ottobock.com/en-gb/prosthetics/upper-limb-prosthetics/bebionic\" target=\"_blank\">Bebionic</a>?\u2019\u201d As a result, TrueLimb\u2019s cost shot up.</span></p><p>Soon enough, says LaChapelle, \u201cWe became exactly the problem we tried to solve. We were just another fancy arm that cost a bunch of money and for the consumer there was still an out of pocket expense.\u201d LaChapelle decided it was unethical to continue this way and has put Unlimited Tomorrow \u201con pause.\u201d In the meantime, he\u2019s working on commercializing some of the innovations he and his team of engineers stumbled upon along the way, such as their haptic glove system, which they hope will take hold in virtual reality applications. \u201cThe US [prosthetics] market is not gonna change,\u201d he says with dismay. With the profits from their glove, he hopes to focus on developing a \u201cbadass body-powered [prosthetic] device\u201d to distribute through a nonprofit.</p><p>The insurance companies are innovating, too, and not in a helpful way. While 3D printed devices now have official, codified L-codes that prosthetists across the US can bill, Joe Johnson says insurance companies don\u2019t care about the benefits of 3D printed devices. \u201cThe lawyers have reached a level of sophistication of writing policy that they can write around mandates [that should guarantee coverage],\u201d Johnson explains. \u201cWe have certain prosthetic mandates for coverage but the insurance companies have become very sophisticated. They\u2019re betting on you giving up.\u201d Insurance companies still refuse to cover even microprocessor-enabled knees, says Johnson, a technology which is going on twenty-five years old. He and his team entertained the possibility of trying to recycle microprocessor knees to increase their affordability to many patients. In a not-to-distant future, they imagined insurance companies would find new ways to thwart their efforts. Says Johnson: \u201cThey\u2019d totally brick those knees.\u201d</p><p><em>This article was supported by the IEEE Foundation and a John C. Taenzer fellowship grant.</em></p>"

The challenge isn\u2019t just about having multiple sensors. Modern robots are equipped with cameras, tactile sensors, depth sensors, and more. The real problem is **how to integrate these different sensory streams**, especially when some sensors provide sparse but critical information at key moments.

The accident happened under conditions that render nearly all of today\u2019s car-mounted sensors useless: fog and bright early-morning sunshine. Radar can\u2019t see small objects well, lidar is limited by fog, and cameras are blinded by glare. Carey and his cofounders decided to create a sensor that could have done the job\u2014a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/terahertz-waves\" target=\"_blank\">terahertz imager</a>.</span></p><p>Historically, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-truth-about-terahertz\" target=\"_blank\">terahertz frequencies</a> have been the least utilized portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. People have struggled to send them even short distances through the air. But thanks to some intense engineering and improvements in silicon transistor frequency, beaming terahertz radiation over hundreds of meters is now possible. <a href=\"https://teradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Teradar</a>, the Boston-based startup Carey cofounded, has managed to make a sensor that can meet the auto industry\u2019s 300-meter distance requirements.</p><p>The company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/teradar-exits-stealth-with-an-all-weather-sensor-for-autonomy-and-150m-in-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">came out of stealth last week</a> with chips it says can deliver 20 times the resolution of automotive radar while seeing through all kinds of weather and costing less than lidar. The tech provides \u201ca superset of lidar and radar combined,\u201d Carey says. The technology is in tests with carmakers for a slot in vehicles to be produced in 2028, he says. It would be the first such sensor to make it to market.</p><p>\u201cEvery time you unlock a chunk of the electromagnetic spectrum, you unlock a brand-new way to view the world,\u201d Carey says. </p><h2>Terahertz imaging for cars</h2><p>Teradar\u2019s system is a new architecture, says Carey, that has elements of traditional <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feral-cat-radar-detector\" target=\"_blank\">radar</a> and a camera. The terahertz transmitters are arrays of elements that generate electronically steerable beams, while the sensors are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-cheap-terahertz-camera\" target=\"_blank\">like imaging chips</a> in a camera. The beams scan the area, and the sensor measures the time it takes for the signals to return as well as where they return from.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A three level image of a rectangular sensor with a chip and other electronics along with its top and bottom packaging.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ea3c5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-three-level-image-of-a-rectangular-sensor-with-a-chip-and-other-electronics-along-with-its-top-and-bottom-packaging.jpg?id=62215321&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Teradar\u2019s system can steer beams of terahertz radiation with no moving parts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Teradar</small></p><p>From these signals, the system generates a point cloud, similar to what a lidar produces. But unlike lidar, it does not use any moving parts. Those moving parts add significantly to the cost of lidar and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mems-lidar\" target=\"_blank\">subject it to wear and tear</a> from the road.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sensor that [has] the simplicity of radar and the resolution of lidar,\u201d says Carey. <span>Whether it replaces either technology or becomes an add-on is up to carmakers, he adds. The company is currently working with five of them.</span></p><h2>Terahertz transistors and circuits<strong></strong></h2><p>That Teradar has gotten this far is partly down to progress in silicon transistor technology\u2014in particular, the steady increase in the maximum frequency of devices that modern foundries can supply, says Carey.</p><p><a href=\"https://hangroup.mit.edu/people/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruonan Han</a>, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT who specializes in terahertz electronics, agrees. These improvements have led to boosts in the efficiency of terahertz circuits, their output power, and the sensitivity of receivers. Additionally, chip packaging, which is key to efficiently transmitting the radiation, has improved. Combined with research into the design of circuits and systems, engineers can now apply terahertz radiation in a variety of applications, including autonomous driving and safety.</p><p>Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s pretty challenging to deliver the performance needed for real and safe self-driving\u2014especially the distance,\u201d says Han. His lab at MIT has worked on terahertz radar and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/terahertz\" target=\"_blank\"> other </a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/qubit-connectivity\" target=\"_blank\">circuits</a> for several years.

This year\u2019s event, also known as the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-quantum-computing-hausi-muller\" target=\"_self\">IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering</a>, marked the first time that the IBM- and community-created working groups\u2019 experts and collaborators publicly presented their research together.</p><p>\u201cWe got great feedback and information about identifying common features across groups,\u201d Crossman says. \u201cThe audience got to hear real-life examples to understand how quantum computing applies to different scenarios and how it works.\u201d</p><p>Crossman understands the importance of sharing research more than most because she works at the intersection of quantum computing research and practical application. The quantum field might seem intimidating, she says, but you don\u2019t need to understand it to use a quantum computer.</p><p>\u201cAnyone can use one,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you know programming languages like <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>, you can code a quantum computer.\u201d</p><h2>The basics of quantum computing</h2><p>IBM has a long-standing history with quantum computing. IEEE Member <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Bennett_(physicist)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Charles H. Bennett</a>, an IBM Fellow, is called the father of quantum information theory because he <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ibm_research_zurich/50425688696/in/photostream/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote the first notes</a> on the subject in 1970. In May 1981, IBM and <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a> held the first <a href=\"https://mitendicotthouse.org/physics-computation-conference/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Physics of Computation Conference</a>.</p><p>\u201cQuantum computing is often used to describe all quantum work,\u201d including quantum science and quantum technology, Crossman says. The field involves a variety of technologies, including sensors, meteorology, and communications.</p><p>Classical computers use bits, and quantum computers use quantum bits, called <em><em>qubits</em></em>. Qubits can exist in more than one state simultaneously (both one and zero), known as the ability to exist in \u201csuperposition.\u201d</p><p>Computers using qubits can store and process highly complex information and data faster and more efficiently, possibly using significantly less energy than classical computers.</p><p>With so much power and processing ability, quantum computers are complex and still not fully understood. Engineers are working to make quantum computing more accessible to everyone, so more people can understand how to work with the technology, Crossman says.</p><h2>Inspired by her father and IEEE</h2><p>Growing up in the North Shore of Boston, Crossman spent many summer mornings poring over the latest issues of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Scientific American</em></em></a> with her older sister. Her father, <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37353021500\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Antony Crossman</a>, is an electrical and electronics engineer and an IEEE life member. He often discussed science and engineering concepts with his daughters.</p><p>Looking back, Crossman says, she sees reading <em><em>Spectrum </em></em>as her first introduction to how research is presented.</p><p>\u201cI loved reading about new research and what could be done with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helped point me toward engineering as a career.\u201d</p><p>When she enrolled at <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McGill University</a> in Montreal in 2011 to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics, her father gifted her an IEEE student membership.</p><p>\u201cMontreal is a beautiful, creative city that\u2019s also relatively easy to travel to from Boston within a day,\u201d she says. \u201cPlus, the school was known for its physics program.\u201d</p><p>After two years, she dropped out and moved to Paris, where she worked in a caf\u00e9. A year later, in 2014, she enrolled in the physics degree program at the <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>.</p><p>In the summer of 2016, Crossman\u2019s undergraduate advisor, Professor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephane-willocq-415a852b/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">St\u00e9phane Willocq</a>, recommended her for a research project in the <a href=\"https://www.mtl.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsystems Technology Laboratory</a> within <a href=\"https://www.eecs.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT\u2019s electrical engineering department</a>.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cQuantum computing is often used to describe all quantum work, including quantum computing, quantum science, and quantum technology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had been conducting research\u201d with Willocq, she says, \u201cand he knew I was considering going into electrical engineering, so he suggested I apply for this summer research opportunity.\u201d</p><p>As a research assistant, she examined carrier transport in transistors and diodes made with two-dimensional materials.</p><p>After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics in 2017, she initially planned to go straight to graduate school, she says, but she wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted to focus on. A friend and former classmate from an undergraduate quantum mechanics course referred her to a quantum computing job opening at <a href=\"https://www.rigetti.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rigetti Computing</a> in Berkeley, Calif.</p><p>She was hired as a junior quantum engineer. She started by creating the predecessor to, and then the schema for, the company\u2019s first device database. She then designed, modeled, and simulated quantum devices such as circuits for superconducting quantum computers, including some used in the first deployed quantum systems. She also managed the Berkeley fabrication facility.</p><p>In that role, she learned a great deal about electrical and microwave engineering, she says, and that introduced her to computational modeling. It led her to better understand practical applications of quantum computing, she says. Her newfound knowledge made her \u201cwant to learn why and how people use quantum technology,\u201d she says, which is how she became interested in the end users\u2019 needs.</p><p>To further her career, she left Rigetti in 2020 and moved to Germany to pursue a dual master\u2019s degree in computational and applied mathematics through a joint program between the <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delft University of Technology</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.tu.berlin/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin</a>. When she first began her master\u2019s program, IBM recruiters offered her two jobs, she says, but she declined because she wanted to finish her degree.</p><p>During her studies, she worked with her mentor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliska-greplova-29bba9150/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eliska Greplova</a>, an associate professor at TU Delft, who invited Crossman to join her <a href=\"https://www.eliskagreplova.com/research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">quantum matter and AI research group</a>. Crossman learned about condensed matter, machine learning, and quantum learning, and she participated in discussions about the technologies\u2019 implications.</p><p>Despite being a great experience, it ultimately led her to decide against pursuing a Ph.D., she says, because she enjoyed working in the industry and that\u2019s where she wanted to be in the long run.</p><p>She had planned to focus her master\u2019s thesis on quantum computing from the end user\u2019s perspective, but she switched to writing about integrating topological properties onto superconducting hardware.</p><p>She graduated in 2022. In January 2023, she accepted a full-time position at <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Research</a> in Germany as a quantum strategy consultant, supporting enterprise clients. Since then, her job has changed to technical engagement lead, overseeing the five quantum working groups.</p><p>She is also part of the team that oversees the company\u2019s responsible computing initiative. IBM defines responsible quantum computing as the type that\u2019s \u201caware of its effects.\u201d The company says it wants to ensure it develops and uses quantum computing in line with <a href=\"https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/responsible-quantum-computing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">its principles</a>.</p><p>Established in 2022 by IBM and researchers from other organizations, the working groups tackle near-term problems and look for quantum and interdisciplinary solutions in their area of focus, Crossman says.</p><p>The groups are community-driven, with researchers from both quantum and nonquantum backgrounds collaborating to identify key problems, decide what to pursue, and pool their expertise to fill gaps, allowing them to look at problems holistically, she says. The groups regularly publish papers and make them publicly available.</p><p>Crossman\u2019s job is to support the researchers, locate resources, help them use the IBM ecosystem, and identify experts to answer niche questions. Her other focus is on the end users, the people who will employ the research emerging from the working groups. She says she seeks to understand their needs and how to best support them.</p><p>\u201cI really enjoy quantum engineering and working with everyone because it\u2019s such an interdisciplinary field,\u201d she says. \u201cIt combines problem-solving with creativity. It\u2019s really at an exciting stage of development.\u201d</p><p>With so much momentum, Crossman says, she is eager to see where quantum technologies go next.</p><p>\u201cWhen I started learning about quantum mechanics in undergrad, there wasn\u2019t much information out there,\u201d she says. \u201cThe beginning of my career was when the quantum computing industry was just getting started. I\u2019m really grateful for that.\u201d</p><h2>Staying current on research</h2><p>Being an IEEE member allows Crossman to stay updated on research across multiple fields, she says, and that\u2019s important because most of them \u201care becoming much more interdisciplinary, especially quantum computing.\u201d</p><p>She says she is looking forward to collaborating more with IEEE members working on quantum computing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always found IEEE useful,\u201d she says. \u201cI can learn about new research in my and other fields, and I really enjoyed attending this year\u2019s Quantum Week.\u201d</p>"

Those include the <a href=\"https://elitetraveler.com/cars-jets-and-yachts/cars/ferrari-296-speciale\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari 296 Speciale </a>and Lamborghini Temerario that I recently drove in Italy.</p><p>Boosted by these power-dense electric machines, these racy Italians carved up roads in Emilia-Romagna like hunks of prosciutto di Parma. The Temerario\u2019s gasoline V-8 revs to a <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en/news/lamborghini-temerario-a-mechanical-masterpiece\" target=\"_blank\"><span>stratospheric 10,000 rpm</span></a>, higher than any production supercar. Still not enough: The Temerario also integrates three YASA motors. A pair on the front axle deliver all-wheel-drive traction and a peak 294 horsepower (216 kilowatts). A total of 907 hybrid horsepower (667 kilowatts) sends the Temerario to a blistering 343 kph (213 mph) top speed. The electric motors ably fill any gaps in gasoline acceleration and finesse the handling with torque-vectoring, the electrified front wheels helping to catapult the Lamborghini out of corners with ridiculous ease.</p><p>With their compact design and superior power-to-weight ratio, these motors are setting records on land, sea and air.

The motor can output a continuous 350-400 kilowatts (469-536 horsepower). Yet the unit weighs just 12.7 kilograms (27.9 pounds). Woolmer says the resulting power density of 59 kilowatts per kilogram is an unofficial world record for an electric motor, and about three times that of leading radial-flux designs, including Tesla\u2019s.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a concept on a screen \u2014 it\u2019s running, right now, on the dynos,\u201d Woolmer says. \u201cWe\u2019ve built an electric motor that\u2019s significantly more power-dense than anything before it, all with scalable materials and processes.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonodling/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Odling</a>, YASA\u2019s chief of new technology, walks me through the tech. Conventional, radial-flux motors are shaped like a sausage roll. A spinning rotor is housed within a stationary stator. The lines of magnetic flux are oriented radially, perpendicular to the motor\u2019s central shaft. These flux lines represent the interacting magnetic fields of the permanent magnets in the rotor and electromagnets in the stator. It is that interaction that provides torque.</p><p>An <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/axial-flux-motor\" target=\"_blank\">axial flux design</a> is more like a pancake. In YASA\u2019s configuration, a pair of much-larger rotors are positioned on either side of the stator, and, notably, all three have roughly the same diameter. Magnetic flux is oriented axially, parallel to the shaft. Because torque is proportional to the rotor diameter squared, an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/axial-flux\" target=\"_blank\">axial-flux</a> design can generate substantially more torque than a comparable radial-flux unit. The dual permanent-magnetic rotors double the key torque-generating components, and ensure a short magnetic path, which enhances efficiency by reducing losses in the magnetic field.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man with a beard, mustache, and eyeglasses holds a round, flat motor about the size of Frisbee disc in front of his torso.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d5fea\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-with-a-beard-mustache-and-eyeglasses-holds-a-round-flat-motor-about-the-size-of-frisbee-disc-in-front-of-his-torso.jpg?id=62210213&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">YASA R&amp;D Engineer Eddie Martin holds a 12.7 kg axial-flux motor that cranks out 750 kilowatts/1,005 horsepower.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">YASA</small></p><p>Odling says the company\u2019s motors are about one-third the mass and length of a comparable radial-flux machine, with intriguing upsides for vehicle packaging and weight savings. \u201cThe motor sits between an engine and gearbox really nicely in a hybrid application, or it makes for a very compact drive unit in an EV,\u201d Odling says. The configuration is also ideal for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hub-motor\" target=\"_blank\">in-wheel motors</a>, because the flat shape fits easily within the width of car and even <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chinese-motorcycles\" target=\"_blank\">motorcycle</a> wheels.</p><p>YASA also touts the weight savings. Cascading gains in vehicle architecture could eliminate at least 200 kilograms from today\u2019s EVs, the company says, about half from the motors themselves, the rest from smaller batteries, brakes, and lighter-weight supporting structures.</p><h2>YASA\u2019s Secret Sauce is a Soft Magnetic Composite</h2><p>The company\u2019s name offers another clue to its technical edge: YASA stands for \u201cYokeless and Segmented Architecture.\u201d The motors remove a heavy iron or steel yoke, the structural and magnetic backbone for the copper coils in a conventional stator. Instead, they use a <a href=\"https://mppinnovation.com/what-are-soft-magnetic-composites/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Soft Magnetic Composite</span></a> (SMC)\u2014a material that has very high magnetic permeability. That characteristic means the material is a very effective conductor of magnetic flux, so it can be used to concentrate and direct the field in the motor. In a typical application, the stator\u2019s coils are wrapped around structures made of SMC.</p><p>Woolmer began studying SMCs in the mid 2000s before there were potential paying customers for his nascent motor designs: The first Tesla Roadster didn\u2019t hit the road until 2008, and suppliers and tooling for these motors didn\u2019t exist then. Woolmer\u2019s early axial-flux designs finally made their way into the Jaguar C-X75 in 2010, a concept that was cancelled prior to production. By 2019, Ferrari was integrating one of Woolmer\u2019s motors in its first hybrid, the SF90.</p><p><a href=\"https://yasa.com/about/#:~:text=Over%20the%20decades%20that%20followed,of%20the%20axial%20flux%20machine.\" target=\"_blank\"><span>SMC became a key innovation</span></a>, because axial-flux motors couldn\u2019t be manufactured with the stacked-steel laminations of radial-flux machines. Woolmer segmented the stator into individual \u201cpole pieces\u201d made from SMC, which can be formed under pressure into a huge variety of 3D shapes. That<span> flexibility greatly reduces weight and eddy-current losses, and lessens the cooling burden. Where a conventional motor might have 30 kilograms of iron, a comparable YASA design would need only 5 kilograms to generate the same power and torque.</span></p><p>YASA\u2019s stators also integrate flat copper windings with direct oil cooling, Odling says, with no \u201cburied copper\u201d that the oil can\u2019t reach. That greatly improves thermal performance and recovery in stressful conditions, a potential boon for high-performance EVs.</p><p>YASA designs and develops its motors at its Oxford Innovation Center. In May, it opened a new axial-motor \u201csuper factory\u201d in nearby Yarnton, with capacity for more than 25,000 motors each year. The company also credits the <a href=\"https://www.apcuk.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>British Advanced Propulsion Center </span></a>(APC) as a linchpin of its expansion. The collaboration between the U.K. government, industry and academia looks to accelerate homegrown development of zero-emissions transportation to meet Net Zero targets.</p><p>YASA intends to release more specifics on its latest prototype motor in December. But company executives say the motor is ready for customers, with no exotic materials or manufacturing techniques required.</p>"
