Surveying approximately 9,000 households across five eurozone countries with varying debt-to-GDP ratios enables a clean cross-country comparison. The key finding is that the fiscal multiplier depends jointly on the financing method and the country\u2019s debt burden: multipliers are smaller in high-debt countries when debt-financed but remain similar across countries when tax-financed. Finally, we develop a New Keynesian model featuring fiscal discipline, which reproduces the empirical patterns observed in the survey and highlights their underlying economic mechanisms."

        "summary": "We study the long-run effects of a large public expansion of pre-primary educa- tion in Argentina. Between 1993 and 1999 the federal government financed the construction of new preschool classrooms targeted to departments with low base- line enrollment and high poverty, creating roughly 186,000 additional places. We link administrative records on classroom construction to four population censuses and estimate difference-in-differences models that compare treated and untreated cohorts across high- and low-construction departments. An additional preschool seat per child increases post-kindergarten schooling by about 0.5 years, raising the probability of completing secondary school by 11.9 percentage points and of enrolling in post-secondary education by 7.1 percentage points. For women, access to the program also reduces completed fertility: an additional seat lowers the number of live births per woman by 0.18, and we find no evidence that selective migration biases these estimates. We find little impact on labor-market outcomes at the census date, consistent with beneficiaries still being in school or in the early stages of their careers. A benefit-cost analysis based on the estimated schooling gains, standard Mincer returns, and observed construction and operating costs yields a benefit-cost ratio of about 11 and an internal rate of return of 13%. Our findings show that universal at-scale pre-primary expansions in middle-income countries can generate sizable improvements in human capital and demographic outcomes at relatively low fiscal cost."

This paper studies the labor market and health effects of c-sections, using newly linked administrative data that combines the universe of California birth records with mothers\u2019 quarterly earnings. We analyze the impact of an intervention that reduced c-section rates among low-risk first-time births, and find that mothers exposed to the intervention appear to have a higher likelihood of employment in the quarter following birth, as well as a higher likelihood of returning to their pre-birth employer. These impacts attenuate over time\u2014suggesting that a c-section primarily delays return to the labor market following childbirth\u2014but attachment to the pre-birth employer remains higher five quarters post-birth. We find no evidence of significant impacts on maternal or infant health, indicating that the intervention-induced decline in c-sections did not come at the cost of worse outcomes. Further, among mothers who have another child, we find that exposure to the intervention at the first birth leads to a lower likelihood of c-section and preterm delivery at the second one, implying that both the economic and health benefits of reduced c-sections may compound with birth order."

Although the existence of labor market power has long been recognized, evidence only recently emerged that such market power regularly arises from sources that are actionable under antitrust law. Since 2010, antitrust agencies have substantially increased labor market enforcement actions. However, many questions relevant to enforcement remain unanswered, such as how to conduct market definition for labor markets, and how best to incorporate concentration into models of the labor market. This article reviews how antitrust is beginning to be used in labor markets, the evidence for and against its use, and the remaining evidence gaps standing in the way of more effective use."

Using a standard framework of production heterogeneity, I show that the gap in productivity and distortions between high and low productivity firms is larger in developing countries, generating large aggregate productivity losses from misallocation. A key empirical property of distortions in developing countries is that they systematically weaken the relationship between firm size and firm productivity. I exploit a unique feature of the WBES data to document which specific aspects of the economic environment faced by firms, such as financial constraints, regulation, corruption, and weak infrastructure, are consistent with the empirical pattern of distortions across countries."

        "summary": "Private equity (PE) has moved rapidly into professional services, yet its impact on accounting, where licensing regimes, reputational capital, and partnership governance traditionally limit external ownership, remains poorly understood. We examine how PE ownership alters the organization and market structure of accounting firms using data from 1999-2024 that link more than 3,600 PE transactions to detailed information on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), labor markets, and audit pricing. PE investment increases sharply after 2020 and extends to both CPA-licensed audit firms and non-CPA advisory practices, with most activity in large mid-tier PCAOB-registered firms. After PE entry, firms grow faster: non-audit revenues rise, employment expands, and cross-state M&amp;A accelerates, consistent with platform-building and consolidation. These adjustments have market-level implications. PE investment raises labor-market concentration in key accounting occupations and drives up ERISA audit fees in a standardized setting, as confirmed by a synthetic difference-in-differences design. Our results reveal a key tension at the core of professions: preserving independence and competition in a market increasingly driven by financial capital."

The paper explores the effect of past reforms on inequality in old age.  We distinguish two separate effects: The mechanical effect considers the change in inequality and expected benefit levels due to the reforms for a fixed retirement age distribution. The behavioral effect accounts for the endogenous change caused by changes in the incentives to work. Our results show that mechanically, reforms have led to losses in expected benefits for all but the lowest income quintile. Behavioral changes had a positive but orders of magnitude smaller effect. Overall, inequality decreased as a result of reforms."

In general, a VPP pulls together many small components\u2014like rooftop solar, home batteries, and smart thermostats\u2014into a single coordinated power system. The system responds to grid needs on demand, whether by making stored energy available or reducing energy consumption by smart devices during peak hours.</p><p>VPPs <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-power-plants-real-power\" target=\"_self\">had a moment</a> in the mid-2010s, but market conditions and the technology weren\u2019t quite aligned for them to take off. Electricity demand <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65264\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wasn\u2019t high enough</a>, and existing sources\u2014coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables\u2014met demand and kept prices stable. Additionally, despite the costs of hardware like solar panels and batteries falling, the software to link and manage these resources lagged behind, and there wasn\u2019t much financial incentive for it to catch up. </p><p>But times have changed, and less than a decade later, the stars are aligning in VPPs\u2019 favor. They\u2019re hitting a deployment inflection point, and they could play a significant role in meeting energy demand over the next 5 to 10 years in a way that\u2019s faster, cheaper, and greener than other solutions. </p><h2>U.S. Electricity Demand Is Growing</h2><p>Electricity demand in the United States is expected to <a href=\"https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/electricity-demand-expected-to-grow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">grow 25 percent</a> by 2030 due to data center buildouts, electric vehicles, manufacturing, and electrification, according to estimates from technology consultant ICF International.</p><p>At the same time, a host of bottlenecks are making it hard to expand the grid. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-data-centers\" target=\"_self\">backlog of at least</a> three to five years on new gas turbines.

This all adds up to a long, slow process to add generation and delivery capacity, and it\u2019s not getting faster anytime soon.</p><p> \u201cFueling electric vehicles, electric heat, and data centers solely from traditional approaches would increase rates that are already too high,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-heavner-9a63b311/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Heavner</a>, the executive director of the <a href=\"https://calssa.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Solar & Storage Association</a>. </p><p>Enter the vast network of resources that are already active and grid-connected\u2014and the perfect storm of factors that make now the time to scale them. <a href=\"https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/nasiri_adel.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adel Nasiri</a>, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of South Carolina, says variability of loads from data centers and electric vehicles has increased, as has deployment of grid-scale batteries and storage. There are more distributed energy resources available than there were before, and the last decade has seen advances in grid management using autonomous controls.</p><p>At the heart of it all, though, is the technology that stores and dispatches electricity on demand: batteries. </p><h2>Advances in Battery Technology</h2><p>Over the last 10 years, battery prices have plummeted: the average <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lithium-ion battery pack</a><a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/commodities/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-see-largest-drop-since-2017-falling-to-115-per-kilowatt-hour-bloombergnef/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> price</a> fell from US $715 per kilowatt-hour in 2014 to $115 per kWh in 2024. Their <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1234-april-18-2022-volumetric-energy-density-lithium-ion-batteries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">energy density</a> has simultaneously increased thanks to a combination of materials advancements, design optimization of battery cells, and improvements in the packaging of battery systems, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-gross-b4a86714/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oliver Gross</a>, a senior fellow in energy storage and electrification at automaker Stellantis.</p><p>The biggest improvements have come in batteries\u2019 cathodes and electrolytes, with nickel-based cathodes starting to be used about a decade ago. \u201cIn many ways, the cathode limits the capacity of the battery, so by unlocking higher capacity cathode materials, we have been able to take advantage of the intrinsic higher capacity of anode materials,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregless/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Less</a>, the director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Battery Lab.</p><p>Increasing the percentage of nickel in the cathode (relative to other metals) increases energy density because nickel can hold more lithium per gram than materials like cobalt or manganese, exchanging more electrons and participating more fully in the redox reactions that move lithium in and out of the battery. The same goes for silicon, which has become more common in anodes. However, there\u2019s a trade-off: These materials cause more structural instability during the battery\u2019s cycling.</p><p>The anode and cathode are surrounded by a liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte has to be electrically and chemically stable when exposed to the anode and cathode in order to avoid safety hazards like thermal runaway or fires and rapid degradation. \u201cThe real revolution has been the breakthroughs in chemistry to make the electrolyte stable against more reactive cathode materials to get the energy density up,\u201d says Gross. Chemical compound additives\u2014many of them based on sulfur and boron chemistry\u2014for the electrolyte help create stable layers between it and the anode and cathode materials. \u201cThey form these protective layers very early in the manufacturing process so that the cell stays stable throughout its life.\u201d</p><p>These advances have primarily been made on electric vehicle batteries, which differ from grid-scale batteries in that EVs are often parked or idle, while grid batteries are constantly connected and need to be ready to transfer energy. However, Gross says, \u201cthe same approaches that got our energy density higher in EVs can also be applied to optimizing grid storage. The materials might be a little different, but the methodologies are the same.\u201d The most popular cathode material for grid storage batteries at the moment is lithium iron phosphate, or LFP.</p><p>Thanks to these technical gains and dropping costs, a domino effect has been set in motion: The more batteries deployed, the cheaper they become, which fuels more deployment and creates positive feedback loops.</p><p>Regions that have experienced frequent blackouts\u2014like parts of <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/07/18/texas-energy-grid-power-outages-climate-change-infrastructure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Texas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-11-06/edison-blacks-out-more-customers-to-stop-utility-sparked-fires\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/puerto-rico-earthquake-power-outages-prepa-news\" target=\"_self\">Puerto Rico</a>\u2014are a prime market for home batteries. Texas-based <a href=\"https://www.basepowercompany.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Base Power</a>, which raised $1 billion in Series C funding in October, installs batteries at customers\u2019 homes and becomes their retail power provider, charging the batteries when excess wind or solar production makes prices cheap, and then selling that energy back to the grid when demand spikes.</p><p>There is, however, still room for improvement. For wider adoption, says Nasiri, \u201cthe installed battery cost needs to get under $100 per kWh for large VPP deployments.\u201d</p><h2>Improvements in VPP Software</h2><p>The software infrastructure that once limited VPPs to pilot projects has matured into a robust digital backbone, making it feasible to operate VPPs at grid scale. Advances in AI are key: Many VPPs now use machine learning algorithms to predict load flexibility, solar and battery output, customer behavior, and grid stress events. This improves the dependability of a VPP\u2019s capacity, which was historically a major concern for grid operators.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a roof-top solar panel.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b3240\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-roof-top-solar-panel.jpg?id=62288941&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">While solar panels have advanced, VPPs have been held back by a lack of similar advancement in the needed software until recently.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sunrun</small></p><p>Cybersecurity and interoperability standards are still evolving.

In short, while the technology and economics for VPPs are firmly in place, there\u2019s work yet to be done aligning regulation, infrastructure, and market design.</p><p>On top of technical and cost constraints, VPPs have long been held back by regulations that prevented them from participating in energy markets like traditional generators. SolarEdge recently <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029315871/en/SolarEdge-Surpasses-500-MWh-of-Storage-in-Virtual-Power-Plants-Across-16-U.S.-States-Canada-and-Puerto-Rico\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> enrollment of more than 500 megawatt-hours of residential battery storage in its VPP programs. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamarasinensky/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tamara Sinensky</a>, the company\u2019s senior manager of grid services, says the biggest hurdle to achieving this milestone wasn\u2019t technical\u2014it was regulatory program design.</p><p>California\u2019s Demand Side Grid Support (<a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/demand-side-grid-support-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DSGS</a>) program, launched in mid-2022, pays homes, businesses, and VPPs to reduce electricity use or discharge energy during grid emergencies. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a massive increase in our VPP enrollments primarily driven by the DSGS program,\u201d says Sinensky. Similarly, Sunrun\u2019s Northern California VPP delivered 535 megawatts of power from home-based batteries to the grid in July, and saw a <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/sunrun-sees-400-growth-in-virtual-power-plant-participation/805169/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">400 percent increase</a> in VPP participation from last year.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/ferc-order-no-2222-explainer-facilitating-participation-electricity-markets-distributed-energy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FERC Order 2222</a>, issued in 2020, requires regional grid operators to allow VPPs to sell power, reduce load, or provide grid services directly to wholesale market operators, and get paid the same market price as a traditional power plant for those services. However, many states and grid regions don\u2019t yet have a process in place to comply with the FERC order. And because utilities profit from grid expansion and not VPP deployment, they\u2019re not incentivized to integrate VPPs into their operations. Utilities \u201cview customer batteries as competition,\u201d says Heavner.</p><p>According to Nasiri, VPPs would have a meaningful impact on the grid if they achieve a penetration of 2 percent of the market\u2019s peak power. \u201cLarger penetration of up to 5 percent for up to 4 hours is required to have a meaningful capacity impact for grid planning and operation,\u201d he says.</p><p>In other words, VPP operators have their work cut out for them in continuing to unlock the flexible capacity in homes, businesses, and EVs. Additional technical and policy advances could move VPPs from a niche reliability tool to a key power source and grid stabilizer for the energy tumult ahead.<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>"

He explained that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know who was looking\u201d at his blood sugar data.</span></p><p>This wasn\u2019t a man unfamiliar with technology\u2014he had successfully used computers for decades in his career. He was of sound mind. But when it came to his health device, he couldn\u2019t find clear answers about where his data went, who could access it, or how to control it. The instructions were dense, and the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/protecting-online-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">privacy settings</a> were buried in multiple menus. So, he made what seemed like the safest choice: he unplugged it. That decision meant giving up real-time glucose monitoring that his doctor had recommended.</p><p>The healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) market is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iot-healthcare-market-worth-289-140000086.html\" target=\"_blank\">projected</a> to exceed $289 billion by 2028, with older adults representing a major share of users. These devices are fall detectors, medication reminders, glucose monitors, heart rate trackers, and others that enable independent living. Yet there\u2019s a widening gap between deployment and adoption. According to an <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/personal-technology/companies-address-online-privacy-concerns/\" target=\"_blank\">AARP survey</a>, 34% of adults over 50 list privacy as a primary barrier to adopting health technology. That represents millions of people who could benefit from monitoring tools but avoid them because they don\u2019t feel safe.</p><p>In my study at the University of Denver\u2019s Ritchie School of Engineering and Computer Science, I surveyed 22 older adults and conducted in-depth interviews with nine participants who use health-monitoring devices. The findings revealed a critical engineering failure: 82% understood security concepts like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/two-factor-authentication-sandia-labs\" target=\"_blank\">two-factor authentication</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/homomorphic-encryption\" target=\"_blank\">encryption</a>, yet only 14% felt confident managing their privacy when using these devices. In my research, I also evaluated 28 healthcare apps designed for older adults and found that 79% lacked basic breach-notification protocols.</p><p>One participant told me, \u201cI know there\u2019s encryption, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really enough to protect my data.\u201d Another said, \u201cThe thought of my health data getting into the wrong hands is very concerning. I\u2019m particularly worried about identity theft or my information being used for scams.\u201d</p><p>This is not a user knowledge problem; it\u2019s an engineering problem. We\u2019ve built systems that demand technical expertise to operate safely, then handed them to people managing complex health needs while navigating age-related changes in vision, cognition, and dexterity.</p><h2>Measuring the Gap</h2><p>To quantify the issues with privacy setting transparency, I developed the Privacy Risk Assessment Framework (PRAF), a tool that scores healthcare apps across five critical domains.</p><p>First, the regulatory compliance domain evaluates whether apps explicitly state adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or other data protection standards. Just claiming to be compliant is not enough\u2014they must provide verifiable evidence.</p><p>Second, the security mechanisms<strong> </strong>domain assesses the implementation of encryption, access controls, and, most critically, breach-notification protocols that alert users when their data may have been compromised. Third, in the usability and accessibility domain, the tool examines whether privacy interfaces are readable and navigable for people with age-related visual or cognitive changes. Fourth, data-minimization practices evaluate whether apps collect only necessary information and clearly specify retention periods. Finally, third-party sharing transparency measures whether users can easily understand who has access to their data and why.</p><p>When I applied PRAF to 28 healthcare apps commonly used by older adults, the results revealed systemic gaps. Only 25% explicitly stated HIPAA compliance, and just 18% mentioned GDPR compliance. Most alarmingly, 79% lacked breach notification protocols, which means that the users may never find out if their data was compromised. The average privacy policy readability scored at a 12th-grade level, even though <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16541986/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research shows</a> that the average reading level of older adults is at an 8th grade level<strong>. </strong>Not a single app included accessibility accommodations in their privacy interfaces.</p><p>Consider what happens when an older adult opens a typical health app. They face a multi-page privacy policy full of legal terminology about \u201cdata controllers\u201d and \u201cprocessing purposes,\u201d followed by settings scattered across multiple menus. One participant told me, \u201cThe instructions are hard to understand, the print is too small, and it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d Another explained, \u201cI don\u2019t feel adequately informed about how my data is collected, stored, and shared. It seems like most of these companies are after profit, and they don\u2019t make it easy for users to understand what\u2019s happening with their data.\u201d</p><p>When protection requires a manual people can\u2019t read, two outcomes follow: they either skip security altogether leaving themselves vulnerable, or abandon the technology entirely, forfeiting its health benefits.</p><h2>Engineering for privacy</h2><p>We need to treat trust as an engineering specification, not a marketing promise. Based on my research findings and the specific barriers older adults face, three approaches address the root causes of distrust.</p><p>The first approach is adaptive security defaults. Rather than requiring users to navigate complex configuration menus, devices should ship with pre-configured best practices that automatically adjust to data sensitivity and device type. A fall detection system doesn\u2019t need the same settings as a continuous glucose monitor. This approach draws from the principle of \u201csecurity by default\u201d in systems engineering.</p><p>Biometric or voice authentication can replace passwords that are easily forgotten or written down. The key is removing the burden of expertise while maintaining strong protection. As one participant put it: \u201cSimplified security settings, better educational resources, and more intuitive user interfaces will be beneficial.\u201d</p><p>The second approach is real-time transparency<strong>.</strong> Users shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings to see where their data goes. Instead, notification systems should show each data access or sharing event in plain language. For example: \u201cYour doctor accessed your heart-rate data at 2 p.m. to review for your upcoming appointment.\u201d A single dashboard should summarize who has access and why.</p><p>This addresses a concern that came up repeatedly in my interviews: users want to know who is seeing their data and why. The engineering challenge here isn\u2019t technical complexity, it\u2019s designing interfaces that convey technical realities in language anyone can understand. Such systems already exist in other domains; banking apps, for instance, send immediate notifications for every transaction. The same principle applies to health data, where the stakes are arguably higher.</p><p>The third approach is invisible security updates. Manual patching creates vulnerability windows. Automatic, seamless updates should be standard for any device handling health data, paired with a simple status indicator so users can confirm protection at a glance. As one participant said, \u201cThe biggest issue that we as seniors have is the fact that we don\u2019t remember our passwords... The new technology is surpassing the ability of seniors to keep up with it.\u201d Automating updates removes a significant source of anxiety and risk.</p><h2>What\u2019s at Stake</h2><p>We can keep building healthcare IoT the way we have: fast, feature-rich, and fundamentally untrustworthy. Or, we can engineer systems that are transparent, secure, and usable by design. Trust isn\u2019t something you market through slogans or legal disclaimers. It\u2019s something you engineer, line by line, into the code itself.<strong> </strong>For older adults relying on technology to maintain independence, that kind of engineering matters more than any new feature we could add. Every unplugged glucose monitor, every abandoned fall detector, every health app deleted out of confusion or fear represents not just a lost sale but a missed opportunity to support someone\u2019s health and autonomy.</p><p>The challenge of privacy in healthcare IoT goes beyond fixing existing systems, it requires reimagining how we communicate privacy itself. My ongoing research builds on these findings through an AI-driven Data Helper, a system that uses large language models to translate dense legal privacy policies into short, accurate, and accessible summaries for older adults. By making data practices transparent and comprehension measurable, this approach aims to turn compliance into understanding and trust, thus advancing the next generation of trustworthy digital health systems.</p>"

Ghost, a company which originated at the <a href=\"https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania</a>, specializes in exceptionally rugged quadrupeds, and while many of its customers use its robots for public safety and disaster relief, it also <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/274841/promising_experiment_signals_future_integration_of_advanced_tech_into_army_units\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">provides robots</a> to the United States military, which has very specific needs when it comes to keeping humans out of danger.</p><p>In that context, it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that Ghost\u2019s robots may sometimes be used to carry weapons, and despite the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-killer-drones\" target=\"_self\">proliferation of robots</a> in many roles in the Ukraine war, the idea of a legged robot carrying a weapon is not a comfortable one for many people. <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> spoke with Ghost co-founder and current CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-kenneally-321a3833/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gavin Kenneally</a> to learn more about the new arm, and to get his perspective on selling robots to the military.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Green military robot dog opens a wooden door with articulated arm.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a501b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/green-military-robot-dog-opens-a-wooden-door-with-articulated-arm.jpg?id=62304622&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Vision 60\u2019s new arm  has six degrees of freedom. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Robots for the Military</h2><p>Ghost Robotics initially made a name for itself with its very impressive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-minitaur-quadruped\" target=\"_self\">early work with the Minitaur direct-drive quadruped</a> in 2016. The company also made headlines in late 2021, when a now-deleted post on Twitter (now X) went viral because it included a photograph of one of Ghost\u2019s Vision 60 quadrupeds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-armed-military-robots\" target=\"_self\">with a rifle mounted on its back</a>.</p><p>That picture resulted in a <a href=\"https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/news/koditscheks-letter-to-ghosts-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">very strong reaction</a>, although as <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> reported at the time, robots with guns affixed to them wasn\u2019t new: To mention one early example, the U.S. military had already deployed weapons on mobile robots <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/04/armed-robots-st/\" target=\"_blank\">in Iraq in 2007</a>. And while several legged robot companies <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative\" target=\"_self\">pledged in 2022 not to weaponize their general purpose robots</a>, the Chinese military <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/30/chinese-armys-latest-weapon-gun-toting-dog\" target=\"_blank\">in 2024 displayed</a> quadrupeds from Unitree equipped with guns. (Unitree, based in China, was one of the signers of the 2022 pledge.)</p><p>The issue of weaponized robots goes far beyond Ghost Robotics, and far beyond robots with legs. We\u2019ve covered both the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots\" target=\"_self\">practical</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-path-towards-reasonable-autonomous-weapons-regulation\" target=\"_self\">ethical</a> perspectives on this extensively at <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, and the intensity of the debates show that there is no easy answer. But to summarize one important point made by some ethicists, some military experts, and Ghost Robotics itself: robots are replaceable, humans are not. \u201cCustomers use our robots to keep people out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Ghost CEO Kenneally tells <em><em>Spectrum.</em></em></p><p>It\u2019s also worth pointing out that even the companies who signed the pledge not to weaponize their general purpose robots <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative\" target=\"_self\">acknowledge</a> that military robots exist, and are accepting of that, provided that such robots are used under existing legal doctrines and operate within those safeguards\u2014and that what constraints should or should not be imposed on these kinds of robots is best decided by policymakers rather than industry.</p><p>This is essentially Ghost Robotics\u2019 position as well, says Kenneally. \u201cWe sell our robots to U.S. and allied governments, and as part of that, the robots are used in defense applications where they will sometimes be weaponized. What\u2019s most critical to us is that the decisions about how to use these robots are happening systematically and ethically at the government policy level.\u201d</p><p>To some extent, these decisions are already being made within the U.S. government. <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jan/25/2003149928/-1/-1/0/DOD-DIRECTIVE-3000.09-AUTONOMY-IN-WEAPON-SYSTEMS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Defense Directive 3000.09</a>, \u2018Autonomy in Weapon Systems,\u2019 lays out the responsibilities and limitations for how autonomous or human-directed robotics weapons systems should be developed and deployed, including requirements for human use-of-force judgements. At least in the U.S., this directive implies that there are rules and accountability for robotic weapons.</p><p></p><h2>Vision 60\u2019s Versatile Arm Capabilities</h2><p>Ghost sees its Vision 60 quadruped as a system that its trusted customers can use as they see fit, and the manipulator enables many additional capabilities. \u201cThe primary purpose of the robot has been as a sensor platform,\u201d Kenneally says, \u201cbut sometimes there are doors in the way, or objects that need to be moved, or you might want the robot to take a sample. So the ability to do all of that mobile manipulation has been hugely valuable for our customers.\u201d</p><p>As it turns out, arms are good for more than manipulation. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been very interesting is that our customers have been using the arm as a sensor boom, which is something that we hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d says Kenneally. Ghost\u2019s robot has plenty of cameras, but they\u2019re mostly at the viewpoint of a moderately-sized dog. The new arm offers a more human-like vantage and a way to peek around corners or over things without exposing the whole robot.</p><p>Ghost was not particularly interested in building their own arm, and tried off-the-shelf options to get the manipulation bit working. And they did get the manipulation working; what didn\u2019t work were any of those arms after the 50 kilogram robot rolled over on them. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that we could build an arm that could stand up to the same intense rigors of our customers\u2019 operations that the rest of the robot can,\u201d says Kenneally. \u201cMorphologically, we actually consider the arm to be a fifth leg, so that the robot operates as a unified system for whole-body control.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the robot is exceptionally rugged, which is what makes it appealing to customers with unique needs, like special forces teams. Enough battery life for more than three hours of walking (or more than 20 hours on standby) isn\u2019t bad, and the Vision 60 is sealed against sand and dust, and can survive complete submergence in shallow water. It can operate in extreme temperatures ranging from -40 \u00b0C to 55 \u00b0C, which has been a particular challenge for robots. And if you do manage to put it in a situation where it physically breaks one of its legs, it\u2019s easy to swap in a spare in just a few minutes, even out in the field.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Robotic dog opening a glass door with its arm in front of a building.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"724f7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/robotic-dog-opening-a-glass-door-with-its-arm-in-front-of-a-building.jpg?id=62304623&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Vision 60 can open doors withe high-level direction from a human operator.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Quadruped Robot Competition From China</h2><p>Despite Ghost quietly selling over a thousand quadrupeds to date, Kenneally is cautious about the near future for legged robots, as is anyone who has seriously considered buying one, because it\u2019s impossible to ignore the option of just buying one from a Chinese company at about a tenth the cost of a quadruped from a company based in the U.S. or Europe.</p><p>\u201cChina has identified legged robotics as a lynchpin technology that they are strategically funding,\u201d Kenneally says. \u201cI think it\u2019s an extremely serious threat in the long term, and we have to take these competitors very seriously despite their current shortcomings.\u201d There is a technological moat, for now, but if the market for legged robots follows the same trajectory as the market for drones did, that moat will shrink drastically over the next few years.</p><p>The United States is poised to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-dronemaker-dji-urges-us-complete-security-review-2025-12-04/\" target=\"_blank\">ban consumer drone sales from Chinese manufacturer DJI</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/08/us-army-just-ordered-soldiers-stop-using-drones-chinas-dji/139999/\" target=\"_blank\">banned DJI drone use by federal agencies in 2017</a>. But it may be too late in some sense, as DJI\u2019s global market share is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/26/1094249/china-commercial-drone-dji-security/\" target=\"_blank\">something like 90 percent</a>. Meanwhile, Unitree may have already cornered <a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/quadruped-state-of-the-market-unitree\" target=\"_blank\">somewhere around 70 percent</a> of the global market for quadrupeds, despite <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit\" target=\"_self\">the recent publication of exploits</a> that allow the robots to send unauthorized data to China.</p><p>In the United States in particular, private sector robotics funding is unpredictable at the best of times, and Kenneally argues that to compete with Chinese-subsidized robot-makers American companies like Ghost who produce these robots domestically will need sustained U.S. government support, too. That doesn\u2019t mean the government has to pick which companies will be the winners, but that it should find a way to support the U.S. robotics industry as a whole, if it still wants to have a meaningful one. \u201cThe quadruped industry isn\u2019t a science project anymore,\u201d says Kenneally. \u201cIt\u2019s matured, and quadruped robots are going to become extremely important in both commercial and government applications. But it\u2019s only through continued innovation that we\u2019ll be able to stay ahead.\u201d</p>"

Such innovation involves some risk, because an intervention anywhere on the U.K.\u2019s tightly meshed power system can have system-wide impacts. (Grid operators elsewhere are choosing to start with GETs at their systems\u2019 periphery\u2014where there\u2019s less impact if something goes wrong.)</p><p>The question is how far\u2014and how fast\u2014the U.K.\u2019s grid operators can push GETs capabilities. The new technologies still have a limited track record, so operators are cautiously feeling their way toward heavier investment. Power system experts also have unanswered questions about these advanced grid capabilities. For example, will they create more complexity than grid operators can manage in real time? Might feedback between different devices destabilize the grid?</p><p>There is no consensus yet as to how to even screen for such risks, let alone protect against them, says <a href=\"https://www.robinpreece.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Preece</a>, professor in future power systems at the University of Manchester, in England. \u201cWe\u2019re at the start of establishing that now, but we\u2019re building at the same time. So it\u2019s kind of this race between the necessity to get this technology installed as quickly as possible, and our ability to fully understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><h2>How is the U.K. Managing Grid Congestion?</h2><p>One of the most innovative and high-stakes tricks in the U.K.\u2019s toolbox employs electronic power-flow controllers, devices that shift electricity from jammed circuits to those with spare capacity. These devices have been able to finesse enough additional wind power through grid bottlenecks to replace an entire gas-fired generator. Installed in northern England four years ago by <a href=\"https://www.smartwires.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Wires</a>, based in Durham, N.C., these SmartValves are expected to help even more as NESO installs more of them and masters their capabilities.</p><p>Warwick-based <a href=\"https://www.nationalgrid.com/electricity-transmission\" target=\"_blank\">National Grid Electricity Transmission</a>, the grid operator for England and Wales, is adding SmartValves and also replacing several thousand kilometers of overhead wire with advanced conductors that can carry more current. And it\u2019s using a technique called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/dynamic-line-rating-grid-congestion\" target=\"_self\">dynamic line rating</a>, whereby sensors and models work together to predict when weather conditions will allow lines to carry extra current.</p><p>Other kinds of GETs are also being used globally. Advanced conductors are the most widely deployed. Dynamic line rating is increasingly common in European countries, and U.S. utilities are beginning to take it seriously. Europe also leads the world in topology-optimization software, which reconfigures power routes to alleviate congestion, and advanced power-flow-control devices like SmartValves.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers wearing hard hats and safety harnesses standing high up on an electricity pylon in the countryside\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4a9a9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-wearing-hard-hats-and-safety-harnesses-standing-high-up-on-an-electricity-pylon-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286977&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Engineers install dynamic line rating technology from the Boston-based company LineVision on National Grid\u2019s transmission network. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p>SmartValves\u2019 chops stand out at the Penwortham substation in Lancashire, England, one of two National Grid sites where the device made its U.K. debut in 2021. Penwortham substation is a major transmission hub, whose spokes desperately need congestion relief. Auditory evidence of heavy power flows was clear during my visit to the substation, which buzzes loudly. The sound is due to the electromechanical stresses on the substation\u2019s massive transformers, explains my guide, National Grid commissioned engineer Paul Lloyd.</p><p>Penwortham\u2019s transformers, circuits, and protective relays are spread over 15 hectares, sandwiched between pastureland and suburban homes near Preston, a small city north of Manchester. Power arrives from the north on two pairs of 400-kilovolt AC lines, and most of it exits southward via 400-kV and 275-kV double-circuit wires.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Power lines crossing a rural pasture, with an old fence in the foreground and a substation in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ce7e1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/power-lines-crossing-a-rural-pasture-with-an-old-fence-in-the-foreground-and-a-substation-in-the-background.jpg?id=62286959&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Transmission lines lead to the congested Penwortham substation, which has become a test-bed for GETs such as  SmartValves and dynamic line rating. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Peter Fairley </small></p><p>What makes the substation a strategic test-bed for GETs is its position just north of the U.K. grid\u2019s biggest bottleneck, known as Boundary B7a, which runs east to west across the island. Nine circuits traverse the B7a: the four AC lines headed south from Penwortham, four AC lines closer to Yorkshire\u2019s North Sea coast, and a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) link offshore. In theory, those circuits can collectively carry 13.6 gigawatts across the B7a. But NESO caps its flow at several gigawatts lower to ensure that no circuits overload if any two lines turn off.</p><p>Such limits are necessary for grid reliability, but they are leaving terawatt-hours of wind power stranded in Scotland and increasing consumers\u2019 energy costs: an extra \u00a3196 million (US $265 million) in 2024 alone. The costs stem from NESO having to ramp up gas-fired generators to meet demand down south while simultaneously compensating wind-farm operators for curtailing their output, as required under U.K. policy.</p><p>So National Grid keeps tweaking Penwortham. In 2011 the substation got its first big GET: phase-shifting transformers (PSTs), a type of analog flow controller. PSTs adjust power flow by creating an AC waveform whose alternating voltage leads or lags its alternating current. They do so by each PST using a pair of connected transformers to selectively combine power from an AC transmission circuit\u2019s three phases. Motors reposition electrical connections on the transformer coils to adjust flows.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Large machines outdoors connected to power lines \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d09c1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/large-machines-outdoors-connected-to-power-lines.jpg?id=62286963&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Phase-shifting transformers (PSTs) were installed in 2012 at the Penwortham substation and are the analog predecessor to SmartValves. They\u2019re powerful but also bulky and relatively inflexible. It can take 10 minutes or more for the PST\u2019s motorized actuators at Penwortham to tap their full range of flow control, whereas SmartValves can shift within milliseconds.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Grid Electricity Transmission </small></p><p><span>Penwortham\u2019s pair of 540-tonne PSTs occupy the entire south end of the substation, along with their dedicated chillers, relays, and power supplies. Delivering all that hardware required extensive road closures and floating a huge barge up the adjacent River Ribble, an event that made national news.</span></p><p>The SmartValves at Penwortham stand in stark contrast to the PSTs\u2019 heft, complexity, and mechanics. SmartValves are a type of static synchronous series compensator, or SSSC\u2014a solid-state alternative to PSTs that employs power electronics to tweak power flows in milliseconds. I saw two sets of them tucked into a corner of the substation, occupying a quarter of the area of the PSTs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers on an elevated platform and tall, cylindrical machinery\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"146f3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-on-an-elevated-platform-and-tall-cylindrical-machinery.jpg?id=62286971&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The SmartValve V103 design [above] experienced some teething and reliability issues that were ironed out with the technology\u2019s next iteration, the V104.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            National Grid Electricity Transmission/Smart Wires        </small> </p><p>The SmartValves are first and foremost an insurance policy to guard against a potentially crippling event: the sudden loss of one of the B7a\u2019s 400-kV lines. If that were to happen, gigawatts of power would instantly seek another route over neighboring lines. And if it happened on a windy day, when lots of power is streaming in from the north, the resulting surge could overload the 275-kV circuits headed from Penwortham to Liverpool. The SmartValves\u2019 job is to save the day.</p><p>They do this by adding impedance to the 275-kV lines, thus acting to divert more power to the remaining 400-kV lines. This rerouting of power prevents a blackout that could potentially cascade through the grid. The upside to that protection is that NESO can safely schedule an additional 350 MW over the B7a.</p><p>The savings add up. \u201cThat\u2019s 350 MW of wind you\u2019re no longer curtailing from wind farms. So that\u2019s 350 times \u00a3100 a megawatt-hour,\u201d says Leslie, at NESO. \u201cThat\u2019s also 350 MW of gas-fired power that you don\u2019t need to replace the wind. So that\u2019s 350 times \u00a3120 a megawatt-hour. The numbers get big quickly.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37266637500\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Osborne</a>, the National Grid lead asset life-cycle engineer managing its SmartValve projects, estimates the devices are saving U.K. customers over \u00a3100 million (US $132 million) a year. At that rate, they\u2019ll pay for themselves \u201cwithin a few years,\u201d Osborne says. By utility standards, where investments are normally amortized over decades, that\u2019s \u201calmost immediately,\u201d he adds.</p><h2>How Do Grid-Enhancing Technologies Work?</h2><p>The way Smart Wires\u2019 SSSC devices adjust power flow is based on emulating impedance, which is a strange beast created by AC power. An AC flow\u2019s changing magnetic field induces an additional voltage in the line\u2019s conductor, which then acts as a drag on the initial field. Smart Wires\u2019 SSSC devices alter power flow by emulating that natural process, effectively adding or subtracting impedance by adding their own voltage wave to the line. Adding a wave that leads the original voltage wave will boost flow, while adding a lagging wave will reduce flow.</p><p>The SSSC\u2019s submodules of capacitors and high-speed insulated-gate bipolar transistors operate in sequence to absorb power from a line and synthesize its novel impedance-altering waves. And thanks to its digital controls and switches, the device can within milliseconds flip from maximum power push to maximum pull.</p><p>You can trace the development of SSSCs to the advent of HVDC transmission in the 1950s. HVDC converters take power from an AC grid and efficiently convert it and transfer it over a DC line to another point in the same grid, or to a neighboring AC grid. In 1985, Narain Hingorani, an HVDC expert at the Palo Alto\u2013based Electric Power Research Institute, showed that similar converters could modulate the flow of an AC line. Four years later, Westinghouse engineer Laszlo Gyugyi proposed SSSCs, which became the basis for Smart Wires\u2019 boxes.</p><p>Major power-equipment manufacturers tried to commercialize SSSCs in the early 2000s. But utilities had little need for flow control back then because they had plenty of conventional power plants that could meet local demand when transmission lines were full.</p><p>The picture changed as solar and wind generation exploded and conventional plants began shutting down. In years past, grid operators addressed grid congestion by turning power plants on or off in strategic locations. But as of 2024, the U.K. had shut down all of its coal-fired power plants\u2014save one, which now burns wood\u2014and it has vowed to slash gas-fired generation from about a quarter of electricity supply in 2024 to at most 5 percent in 2030.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">The U.K.\u2019s extreme grid challenge has made it ground zero for some of the boldest GETs testing and deployment.</p><p>To seize the emerging market opportunity presented by changing grid operations, Smart Wires had to make a crucial technology upgrade: ditching transformers. The company\u2019s first SSSC, and those from other suppliers, relied on a transformer to absorb lightning, voltage surges, and every other grid assault that could fry their power electronics. This made them bulky and added cost. So Smart Wires engineers set to work in 2017 to see if they could live without the transformer, says Frank Kreikebaum, Smart Wires\u2019s interim chief of engineering. Two years later the company had assembled a transformerless electronic shield. It consisted of a suite of filters and diverters, along with a control system to activate them. Ditching the transformer produced a trim, standardized product\u2014a modular system-in-a-box.</p><p>SmartValves work at any voltage and are generally ganged together to achieve a desired level of flow control. They can be delivered fast, and they fit in the kinds of tight spaces that are common in substations. \u201cIt\u2019s not about cost, even though we\u2019re competitive there. It\u2019s about \u2018how quick\u2019 and \u2018can it fit,\u2019\u201d says Kreikebaum.</p><p>And if the grid\u2019s pinch point shifts? The devices can be quickly moved to another substation. \u201cIt\u2019s a Lego-brick build,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-wilkes/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Owen Wilkes</a>, National Grid\u2019s director of network design. Wilkes\u2019s team decides where to add equipment based on today\u2019s best projections, but he appreciates the flexibility to respond to unexpected changes.</p><p>National Grid\u2019s deployments in 2021 were the highest-voltage installation of SSSCs at the time, and success there is fueling expansion. National Grid now has packs of SmartValves installed at three substations in northern England and under construction at another, with five more installations planned in that area. Smart Wires has also commissioned commercial projects at transmission substations in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and the United States.</p><h2>Dynamic Line Rating Boosts Grid Efficiency</h2><p>In addition to SSSCs, National Grid has deployed lidar that senses sag on Penwortham\u2019s 275-kV lines\u2014an indication that they\u2019re starting to overheat. The sensors are part of a dynamic line rating system and help grid operators maximize the amount of current that high-voltage lines can carry based on near-real-time weather conditions. (Cooler weather means more capacity.) Now the same technology is being deployed across the B7a\u2014a \u00a31 million investment that is projected to save consumers \u00a333 million annually, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/corin-ireland-4040b2179/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Corin Ireland</a>, a National Grid optimization engineer with the task of seizing GETs opportunities.</p><p>There\u2019s also a lot of old conductor wires being swapped out for those that can carry more power. National Grid\u2019s business plan calls for 2,416 kilometers of such reconductoring over the coming five years, which is about 20 percent of its system. Scotland\u2019s transmission operators are busy with their own big swaps.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rural farmland with shape and rotating wind turbines \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"80b0b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rural-farmland-with-shape-and-rotating-wind-turbines.jpg?id=62286812&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Scottish wind farms have doubled their power output over the past decade, but it often gets stranded due to grid congestion in England.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Andreas Berthold/Alamy        </small> </p><p>But while National Grid and NESO are making some of the boldest deployments of GETs in the world, they\u2019re not fully tapping the technologies\u2019 capabilities. That\u2019s partly due to the conservative nature of power utilities, and partly because grid operators already have plenty to keep their eyes on. It also stems from the unknowns that still surround GETs, like whether they might take the grid in unforeseen directions if allowed to respond automatically, or get stuck in a feedback loop responding to each other. Imagine SmartValve controllers at different substations fighting, with one substation jumping to remove impedance that the other just added, causing fluctuating power flows.</p><p>\u201cThese technologies operate very quickly, but the computers in the control room are still very reliant on people making decisions,\u201d says Ireland. \u201cSo there are time scales that we have to take into consideration when planning and operating the network.\u201d</p><p>This kind of conservative dispatching leaves value on the table. For example, the dynamic line rating models can spit out new line ratings every 15 minutes, but grid operators get updates only every 24 hours. Fewer updates means fewer opportunities to tap the system\u2019s ability to boost capacity. Similarly, for SmartValves, NESO activates installations at only one substation at a time. And control-room operators turn them on manually, even though the devices could automatically respond to faults within milliseconds.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Workers in harnesses and hard hats climbing and standing high up on a transmission tower in the countryside.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9e46e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/workers-in-harnesses-and-hard-hats-climbing-and-standing-high-up-on-a-transmission-tower-in-the-countryside.jpg?id=62286819&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">National Grid is upgrading transmission lines dating as far back as the 1960s. This includes installing conductors that retain their strength at higher temperatures, allowing them to carry more power.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            National Grid Electricity Transmission        </small> </p><p>Modeling by Smart Wires and National Grid shows a significant capacity boost across Boundary B7a if Penwortham\u2019s SmartValves were to work in tandem with another set further up the line. For example, when Penwortham is adding impedance to push megawatts off the 275-kV lines, a set closer to Scotland could simultaneously pull the power north, nudging the sum over to the B7a\u2019s eastern circuits. Simulations by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hiorns-6a92b158/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Hiorns</a>, a former National Grid planning director who consults for Smart Wires, suggest that this kind of cooperative action should increase the B7a circuits\u2019 usable capacity by another 250 to 300 MW. \u201cYou double the effectiveness by using them as pairs,\u201d he says.</p><p>Operating multiple flow controllers may become necessary for unlocking the next boundary en route to London, south of the B7a, called Boundary B8. As dynamic line rating, beefier conductors, and SmartValves send more power across the B7a, lines traversing B8 are reaching their limits. Eventually, every boundary along the route will have to be upgraded.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at its U.S. headquarters, Smart Wires is developing other applications for its SSSCs, such as filtering out power oscillations that can destabilize grids and reduce allowable transfers. That capability could be unlocked remotely with firmware.</p><p>The company is also working on a test program that could turn on pairs of SmartValve installations during slack moments when there isn\u2019t much going on in the control rooms. That would give National Grid and NESO operators an opportunity to observe the impacts, and to get more comfortable with the technology.</p><p>National Grid and Smart Wires are also hard at work developing industry-first optimization software for coordinating flow-control devices. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to extend the technology from how we\u2019re using it today,\u201d says Ireland at National Grid. \u201cThat\u2019s the exciting bit.\u201d</p><p>NESO\u2019s Julian Leslie shares that excitement and says he expects SmartValves to begin working together to ease power through the grid\u2014once the operators have the modeling right and get a little more comfortable with the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a great innovation that has the potential to be really transformational,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re just not quite there yet.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Charette can be pretty depressing. Charette, who has been writing about software failures for this magazine for the past 20 years, is a renowned risk analyst and systems expert who over the course of a 50-year career has seen more than his share of delusional thinking among IT professionals, government officials, and corporate executives, before, during, and after massive software failures.</p><p>In 2005\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">Why Software Fails</a>,\u201d in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, a seminal article documenting the causes behind large-scale software failures, Charette noted, \u201cThe biggest tragedy is that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-failure\" target=\"_self\">software failure</a> is for the most part predictable and avoidable. Unfortunately, most organizations don\u2019t see preventing failure as an urgent matter, even though that view risks harming the organization and maybe even destroying it. Understanding why this attitude persists is not just an academic exercise; it has tremendous implications for business and society.\u201d</p><p>Two decades and several trillion wasted dollars later, he finds that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures\" target=\"_blank\">people are making the same mistakes</a>. They claim their project is unique, so past lessons don\u2019t apply. They underestimate complexity. Managers come out of the gate with unrealistic budgets and timelines. Testing is inadequate<strong> </strong>or skipped entirely. Vendor promises that are too good to be true are taken at face value. Newer development approaches like DevOps or AI copilots are implemented without proper training or the organizational change necessary to make the most of them.</p><p>What\u2019s worse, the huge impacts of these missteps on end users aren\u2019t fully accounted for. When the Canadian government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aurO_LK6DEI\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix paycheck system</a> initially failed, for instance, the developers glossed over the protracted financial and emotional distress inflicted on tens of thousands of employees receiving erroneous paychecks; problems persist today, nine years later. Perhaps that\u2019s because, as Charette told me recently, IT project managers don\u2019t have professional licensing requirements and are rarely, if ever, held legally liable for software debacles.</p><p>While medical devices may seem a far cry from giant IT projects, they have a few things in common. As Special Projects Editor Stephen Cass uncovered in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/medical-device-recalls\" target=\"_blank\">The Data</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalls</a> on average 20 medical devices per month due to software issues.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity. We would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem having AWS go down.\u201d <strong>\u2014Robert N. Charette</strong></p><p>Like IT projects, medical devices face fundamental challenges posed by software complexity. Which means that testing, though rigorous and regulated in the medical domain, can\u2019t possibly cover every scenario or every line of code. The major difference between failed medical devices and failed IT projects is that a huge amount of liability attaches to the former.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re building software for medical devices, there are a lot more standards that have to be met and a lot more concern about the consequences of failure,\u201d Charette observes. \u201cBecause when those things don\u2019t work, there\u2019s tort law available, which means manufacturers are on the hook. It\u2019s much harder to bring a case and win when you\u2019re talking about an electronic payroll system.\u201d</p><p>Whether a software failure is hyperlocal, as when a medical device fails inside your body, or spread across an entire region, like when an airline\u2019s ticketing system crashes, organizations need to dig into the root causes and apply those lessons to the next device or IT project if they hope to stop history from repeating itself.</p><p>\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity,\u201d Charette says. \u201cWe would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem accepting AWS going down or telcos or banks going out.\u201d He lets out a heavy sigh worthy of A.A. Milne\u2019s Eeyore. \u201cPeople just kind of shrug their shoulders.\u201d</p>"

Yet engineering\u2019s impact lies not only in technical advancement but also in its ability to serve the greater good. This foundational principle is behind IEEE\u2019s public imperative initiatives which apply our efforts and expertise to support our mission to advance technology for humanity with a direct benefit to society. </p><h2>Serving society </h2><p>Public imperative activities and initiatives serve society by promoting understanding, impact for humans and our environment, and responsible use of science and technology. These initiatives encompass a wide range of efforts, including<a href=\"https://move.ieeeusa.org/about/stem-outreach/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> STEM outreach</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeht.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> humanitarian technology deployments</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeusa.org/public-policy/priorities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> public education on emerging technologies</a>, and<a href=\"https://sustainable-climate.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> sustainability</a>. Unlike many efforts advancing technology, these initiatives are not designed with financial opportunity in mind. Instead, they fulfill IEEE\u2019s designation as a 501(c)(3) public charity engaged in scientific and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/microcredentials\" target=\"_blank\">educational activities</a> for the benefit of the engineering community and the public.</p><h3>Building a Better World</h3><br /><p>Across the globe, IEEE members and volunteers dedicate their time and use their talents, experiences, and expertise to lead, organize, and drive activities to advance technology for humanity. The<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/social-impact-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Social Impact</a> report showcases a selection of recent projects and initiatives that support that mission.</p><p>In my March column, I described my vision for One IEEE, which is aimed at empowering IEEE\u2019s diverse units to work together in ways that magnify their individual and collective impact. Within the framework of One IEEE, public imperative activities are not peripheral; they are central to unifying the organization and amplifying our global relevance. Across IEEE\u2019s varied regions, societies, and technical communities, these activities align efforts around a shared mission. They provide our members from different disciplines and geographies the opportunity to collaborate on projects that transcend boundaries, fostering interdisciplinary innovation and global stewardship.</p><p>Such activities also offer members opportunities to apply their technical expertise in service of societal needs. Whether<a href=\"https://ctu.ieee.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> finding innovative solutions to connect the unconnected</a> or developing<a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> open-source educational tools for students</a>, we are solving real-world problems. The initiatives transform abstract technical knowledge into actionable solutions, reinforcing the idea that technology is not just about building systems\u2014it\u2019s about building futures.</p><p>For our <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-student-projects\" target=\"_blank\">young professionals and students</a>, these activities offer hands-on experiences that connect technical skills with real-world applications, inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in engineering with purpose and passion. These activities also create mentorship opportunities, leadership pathways, and a sense of belonging within the wider IEEE community.</p><h2>Principled tech leader</h2><p>In an age when technology influences practically every aspect of life\u2014from health care and energy to communication and transportation\u2014IEEE must, as a leading technical authority, also serve as a socially responsible leader. Public imperative activities include IEEE\u2019s commitment to ethical development, university and pre-university education, and accessible innovation. They help bridge the gap between technical communities and the public, working to ensure that engineering solutions are accessible, equitable, and aligned with societal values.</p><p>From a strategic standpoint, public imperatives also support IEEE\u2019s long-term sustainability. The organization is redesigning its budget process to emphasize aligning financial resources with mission-driven goals. One of the guiding principles is to publicize IEEE\u2019s public charity status and invest accordingly.</p><p>That means promoting our public imperatives in funding decisions, integrating them into operational planning, and measuring their outcomes with engineering rigor. By treating these activities as core infrastructure, IEEE ensures that its resources are deployed in ways that maximize public benefit and organizational impact.</p><p>Public imperatives are vital to the success of One IEEE. They embody the organization\u2019s mission, unify its global membership, and demonstrate the societal relevance of engineering and technology. They offer our members the opportunity to apply their skills in meaningful ways, contribute to public good, and shape the future of technology with integrity.</p><p>Through our public imperative activities, IEEE is a force for innovation and a driver of meaningful impact.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201c<span>Engineering With Purpose</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

Decades of engineering assumptions, predictable inertia, dispatchable baseload generation, and slow, well-characterized system dynamics, are now eroding as wind and solar become dominant sources of electricity. Grid operators face increasingly steep ramp events, larger frequency excursions, faster transients, and prolonged periods where fossil generation is minimal or absent.</p><p>In this environment, battery energy storage systems (BESS) have emerged as essential tools for maintaining stability. They can respond in milliseconds, deliver precise power control, and operate flexibly across a range of services. But unlike conventional generation, batteries are sensitive to operational history, thermal environment, state of charge window, system architecture, and degradation mechanisms. Their long-term behavior cannot be described by a single model or simple efficiency curve, it is the product of complex electrochemical, thermal, and control interactions.</p><p>Most laboratory tests and simulations attempt to capture these effects, but they rarely reproduce the operational irregularities of the grid. Batteries in real markets are exposed to rapid fluctuations in power demand, partial state of charge cycling, fast recovery intervals, high-rate events, and unpredictable disturbances. As <a href=\"https://sheffield.ac.uk/eee/people/academic-staff/dan-gladwin\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Dan Gladwin</a>, who leads Sheffield\u2019s research into grid-connected energy storage, puts it, \u201cyou only understand how storage behaves when you expose it to the conditions it actually sees on the grid.\u201d</p><p>This disconnect creates a fundamental challenge for the industry: How can we trust degradation models, lifetime predictions, and operational strategies if they have never been validated against genuine grid behavior?</p><p>Few research institutions have access to the infrastructure needed to answer that question. <a href=\"https://sheffield.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The University of Sheffield</a> is one of them.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rows of battery racks with red connectors in a power storage facility.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e842d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/rows-of-battery-racks-with-red-connectors-in-a-power-storage-facility.jpg?id=62304947&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sheffield\u2019s Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA) operates one of the UK\u2019s only research-led, grid-connected, multi-megawatt battery energy storage testbeds. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The University of Sheffield</small></p><h2>Sheffield\u2019s unique facility</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://sheffield.ac.uk/creesa\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA)</a> operates one of the UK\u2019s only research-led, grid-connected, multi-megawatt battery energy storage testbeds. This environment enables researchers to test storage technologies not just in simulation or controlled cycling rigs, but under full-scale, live grid conditions. As Professor Gladwin notes, \u201cwe aim to bridge the gap between controlled laboratory research and the demands of real grid operation.\u201d</p><p>At the heart of the facility is an 11 kV, 4 MW network connection that provides the electrical and operational realism required for advanced diagnostics, fault studies, control algorithm development, techno-economic analysis, and lifetime modeling. Unlike microgrid scale demonstrators or isolated laboratory benches, Sheffield\u2019s environment allows energy storage assets to interact with the same disturbances, market signals, and grid dynamics they would experience in commercial deployment.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThe ability to test at scale, under real operational conditions, is what gives us insights that simulation alone cannot provide.\u201d <strong>\u2014Professor Dan Gladwin, The University of Sheffield</strong></p><p>The facility includes:</p><ul><li>A 2 MW / 1 MWh lithium titanate system, among the first independent grid-connected BESS of its kind in the UK</li><li>A 100 kW second-life EV battery platform, enabling research into reuse, repurposing, and circular-economy models</li><li>Support for flywheel systems, supercapacitors, hybrid architectures, and fuel-cell technologies</li><li>More than 150 laboratory cell-testing channels, environmental chambers, and impedance spectroscopy equipment</li><li>High-speed data acquisition and integrated control systems for parameter estimation, thermal analysis, and fault response measurement</li></ul><p>The infrastructure allows Sheffield to operate storage assets directly on the live grid, where they respond to real market signals, deliver contracted power services, and experience genuine frequency deviations, voltage events, and operational disturbances. When controlled experiments are required, the same platform can replay historical grid and market signals, enabling repeatable full power testing under conditions that faithfully reflect commercial operation. This combination provides empirical data of a quality and realism rarely available outside utility-scale deployments, allowing researchers to analyse system behavior at millisecond timescales and gather data at a granularity rarely achievable in conventional laboratory environments.</p><p>According to Professor Gladwin, \u201cthe ability to test at scale, under real operational conditions, is what gives us insights that simulation alone cannot provide.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Man in a suit stands in a lab with equipment and computer showing graphics.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"81b46\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-in-a-suit-stands-in-a-lab-with-equipment-and-computer-showing-graphics.jpg?id=62304994&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Dan Gladwin, Professor of Electrical and Control Systems Engineering, leads Sheffield\u2019s research into grid-connected energy storage.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The University of Sheffield</small></p><h2>Setting the benchmark with grid scale demonstration</h2><p>One of Sheffield\u2019s earliest breakthroughs came with the installation of a 2 MW / 1 MWh lithium titanate demonstrator, a first-of-a-kind system installed at a time when the UK had no established standards for BESS connection, safety, or control. Professor Gladwin led the engineering, design, installation, and commissioning of the system, establishing one of the country\u2019s first independent megawatt scale storage platforms.</p><p>The project provided deep insight into how high-power battery chemistries behave under grid stressors. Researchers observed sub-second response times and measured the system\u2019s capability to deliver synthetic inertia-like behavior. As Gladwin reflects, \u201cthat project showed us just how fast and capable storage could be when properly integrated into the grid.\u201d</p><p>But the demonstrator\u2019s long-term value has been its continued operation. Over nearly a decade of research, it has served as a platform for:</p><ul><li>Hybridization studies, including battery-flywheel control architectures</li><li>Response time optimization for new grid services</li><li>Operator training and market integration, exposing control rooms and traders to a live asset</li><li>Algorithm development, including dispatch controllers, forecasting tools, and prognostic and health management systems</li><li>Comparative benchmarking, such as evaluation of different lithium-ion chemistries, lead-acid systems, and second-life batteries</li></ul><p>A recurring finding is that behavior observed on the live grid often differs significantly from what laboratory tests predict. Subtle electrical, thermal, and balance-of-plant interactions that barely register in controlled experiments can become important at megawatt-scale, especially when systems are exposed to rapid cycling, fluctuating set-points, or tightly coupled control actions. Variations in efficiency, cooling system response, and auxiliary power demand can also amplify these effects under real operating stress. As Professor Gladwin notes, \u201cphenomena that never appear in a lab can dominate behavior at megawatt scale.\u201d</p><p>These real-world insights feed directly into improved system design. By understanding how efficiency losses, thermal behavior, auxiliary systems, and control interactions emerge at scale, researchers can refine both the assumptions and architecture of future deployments. This closes the loop between application and design, ensuring that new storage systems can be engineered for the operational conditions they will genuinely encounter rather than idealized laboratory expectations.</p><h2>Ensuring longevity with advanced diagnostics</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Battery testing unit with connected cables and a metal duct.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"260ac\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/battery-testing-unit-with-connected-cables-and-a-metal-duct.jpg?id=62304950&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sheffield\u2019s Centre for Research into Electrical Energy Storage and Applications (CREESA) enables researchers to test storage technologies not just in simulation or controlled cycling rigs, but under full-scale, live grid conditions.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The University of Sheffield</small></p>Ensuring the long-term reliability of storage requires understanding how systems age under the conditions they actually face. Sheffield\u2019s research combines high-resolution laboratory testing with empirical data from full-scale grid-connected assets, building a comprehensive approach to diagnostics and prognostics. In Gladwin\u2019s words, \u201cA model is only as good as the data and conditions that shape it. To predict lifetime with confidence, we need laboratory measurements, full-scale testing, and validation under real-world operating conditions working together.\u201d<p>A major focus is accurate state estimation during highly dynamic operation. Using advanced observers, Kalman filtering, and hybrid physics-ML approaches, the team has developed methods that deliver reliable SOC, SOH and SOP estimates during rapid power swings, irregular cycling, and noisy conditions where traditional methods break down.</p><p>Another key contribution is understanding cell-to-cell divergence in large strings. Sheffield\u2019s data shows how imbalance accelerates near SOC extremes, how thermal gradients drive uneven ageing, and how current distribution causes long-term drift. These insights inform balancing strategies that improve usable capacity and safety.</p><p>Sheffield has also strengthened lifetime and degradation modeling by incorporating real grid behavior directly into the framework. By analyzing actual market signals, frequency deviations, and dispatch patterns, the team uncovers ageing mechanisms that do not appear during controlled laboratory cycling and would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p>These contributions fall into four core areas:</p><h4>State Estimation and Parameter Identification</h4><ul><li>Robust SOC/SOH estimation</li><li>Online parameter identification for equivalent circuit models</li><li>Power capability prediction using transient excitation</li><li>Data selection strategies under noise and variability</li></ul><h4>Degradation and Lifetime Modelling</h4><ul><li>Degradation models built on real frequency and market data</li><li>Analysis of micro cycling and asymmetric duty cycles</li><li>Hybrid physics-ML forecasting models</li></ul><h4>Thermal and Imbalance Behavior</h4><ul><li>Characterizing thermal gradients in containerized systems</li><li>Understanding cell imbalance in large-scale systems</li><li>Mitigation strategies at the cell and module level</li><li>Coupled thermal-electrical behavior under fast cycling</li></ul><h4>Hybrid Systems and Multi-Technology Optimization</h4><ul><li>Battery-flywheel coordination strategies</li><li>Techno-economic modeling for hybrid assets</li><li>Dispatch optimization using evolutionary algorithms</li><li>Control schemes that extend lifetime and enhance service performance</li></ul><p>Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield\u2019s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments. A key example is the collaboration with <a href=\"https://mopo.co/\" target=\"_blank\">MOPO</a>, a company deploying pay-per-swap lithium-ion battery packs in low-income communities across Sub-Saharan Africa. These batteries face deep cycling, variable user behavior, and sustained high temperatures, all without active cooling or controlled environments. The team\u2019s techniques in cell characterization, parameter estimation, and in-situ health tracking have helped extend the usable life of MOPO\u2019s battery packs. \u201cBy applying our know-how, we can make these battery-swap packs clean, safe, and significantly more affordable than petrol and diesel generators for the communities that rely on them,\u201d says Professor Gladwin.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Beyond grid-connected systems, Sheffield\u2019s diagnostic methods have also proved valuable in off-grid environments.

That\u2019s a problem Peng Zou and his team at startup <a href=\"https://www.powerlatticeinc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PowerLattice</a> say they have solved by miniaturizing and repackaging high-voltage regulators.</p><p>The company claims that its new <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chiplet\" target=\"_self\">chiplets</a> deliver up to a 50 percent reduction in power consumption and twice performance per watt by sizing down the voltage conversion process and moving it significantly closer to processors.</p><h2>Shrinking and Moving Power Delivery</h2><p>Traditional systems deliver power to AI chips by converting AC power from the grid into DC power, which then gets transformed again into low-voltage (around one volt) DC, usable by the GPU. With that voltage drop, current must increase to conserve power. </p><p>This exchange happens near the processor, but the current still travels a meaningful distance in its low-voltage state. A high current traveling any distance is bad news, because the system loses power in the form of heat proportional to the current squared. \u201cThe closer you get to the processor, the less distance that the high current has to travel, and thus we can reduce the power loss,\u201d says <a href=\"https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/hanh-phuc-le\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hanh-Phuc Le</a>, who researches power electronics at the University California, San Diego and has no connection to PowerLattice.</p><p>Given the ever-growing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" target=\"_self\">power consumption of AI data centers</a>, \u201cthis has almost become a show-stopping issue today,\u201d PowerLattice\u2019s Zou says.</p><p>Zou thinks he and his colleagues have found a way to avoid this huge loss of power. Instead of dropping the voltage a few centimeters away from the processor, they figured out how to do it millimeters away, within the processor\u2019s package. PowerLattice designed tiny power delivery chiplets\u2014shrinking inductors, voltage control circuits, and software-programmable logic into an IC about twice the size of a pencil eraser. The chiplets sit under the processor\u2019s package substrate, to which they\u2019re connected.</p><p>One challenge the minds at PowerLattice faced was how to make inductors smaller without altering their capabilities. Inductors temporarily store energy and then release it smoothly, helping regulators maintain steady outputs. Their physical size directly influences how much energy they can manage, so shrinking them weakens their effect.</p><p>The startup countered this issue by building their inductors from a specialized magnetic alloy that \u201cenables us to run the inductor very efficiently at high frequency,\u201d Zou says. \u201cWe can operate at a hundred times higher frequency than the traditional solution.\u201d At higher operating frequencies, circuits can be designed to use an inductor with a much lower inductance, meaning the component itself can be made with less physical material. The alloy is unique because it maintains better magnetic properties than comparable materials at these high frequencies.</p><p>The resulting chiplets are less than 1/20th the area of today\u2019s voltage regulators, Zou says. And each is only 100 micrometers thick, around the thickness of a strand of hair. Being so tiny allows the chiplets to fit as close as possible to the processor, and the space savings provide valuable real estate to other components.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"3D rendering of PowerLattice's chiplets on the underside of a processor package.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e0195\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/3d-rendering-of-powerlattice-s-chiplets-on-the-underside-of-a-processor-package.jpg?id=62303434&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">PowerLattice\u2019s chiplets would sit on the underside of a GPU\u2019s package to provide power from below.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">PowerLattice</small></p><p>Even at their small size, the proprietary tech is \u201chighly configurable and scalable,\u201d Zou says. Customers can use multiple chiplets for a more comprehensive fix or fewer if their architecture doesn\u2019t require it. \u201cIt\u2019s one key differentiator\u201d of PowerLattice\u2019s solution to the voltage regulation problem, according to Zou.</p><p>Employing the chiplets can reduce 50 percent of power needs for an operator, effectively doubling performance, the company claims. But this number seems ambitious to Le. He says that 50 percent power savings \u201ccould be achievable, but that means PowerLattice has to have direct control of the load, which includes the processor as well.\u201d The only way he sees it as realistic is if the company has the ability to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-circuit-to-boost-battery-life\" target=\"_self\">manage power supply in real time </a>depending on a processor\u2019s workload\u2014a technique called <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/dynamic-voltage-and-frequency-scaling\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic voltage and frequency scaling</a>\u2014which PowerLattice does not.</p><h2>Facing Competition</h2><p>Right now, PowerLattice is in the midst of reliability and validation testing before it releases its first product to customers, in about two years. But bringing the chiplets to market won\u2019t be straightforward because PowerLattice has some big-name competition. Intel, for example, is developing a <a href=\"https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/ipla/software-development-platforms/servers/platforms/intel-pentium-silver-and-intel-celeron-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/fully-integrated-voltage-regulator-fivr/\" target=\"_blank\">Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator</a>, a device partially devoted to solving the same problem. </p><p>Zou doesn\u2019t consider Intel competition because, in addition to the products differing in their approaches to the power delivery problem, he does not believe Intel will be providing its technology to its competitors. \u201cFrom a market position perspective, we are quite a bit different,\u201d Zou says.</p><p>A decade ago, PowerLattice wouldn\u2019t have room to succeed, Le says, because companies that sold processors only ensured reliability for their chips if customers purchased their power supplies as well. \u201cQualcomm, for example, can sell their processor chip and the vast majority of their customers also have to buy their proprietary Qualcomm power supply management chip because otherwise they would say, \u2018We don\u2019t guarantee the reliable operation of the whole system.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Now, though, there may be hope. \u201cThere\u2019s a trend of what we call chiplet implementation, so it is a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-view-of-the-chiplet-revolution\" target=\"_self\">heterogeneous integration</a>,\u201d Le says. Customers are mixing and matching components from different companies to achieve better system optimization, he says. </p><p>And while notable providers like Intel and Qualcomm may continue to have the upper hand with notable customers, smaller companies\u2014mostly startups\u2014building processors and AI infrastructures will also be power hungry. These groups will need to look for a power supply source, and that\u2019s where PowerLattice and similar companies could come in, Le says. \u201cThat\u2019s how the market is. We have a startup working with a startup doing something that actually rivals, and even competes with, some large companies.\u201d</p>"

Chess by telegraph also prefigured chess played through other means of telecommunications. There are records of recreational and serious games played over radio, on telephone lines, satellite, and through online interfaces including forums, email, and dedicated live services.

Smith</a>, who had supported the project in 1838 while still a sitting congressman from Maine. By late 1844, a bill to extend the line to New York was in front of the U.S. House of Representatives. In at least one way, drawing the attention of legislators to the new line was relatively easy\u2014the Washington end moved back and forth between the Capitol building and<a href=\"https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/headquarters-sites.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> the post office</a>, near the present-day National Portrait Gallery. If you were a lawmaker in Washington at the time, the telegraph would\u2019ve been hard to miss.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>But perhaps they needed more persuading. Orrin S. Wood, a telegraph operator, thought so. On 5 December 1844, Wood wrote <a href=\"https://reader.library.cornell.edu/docviewer/digital?id=ezra0002_4#page/12/mode/1up\" target=\"_blank\">a letter</a> to his brother-in-law, engineer Ezra Cornell, who had worked on the line and would go on to cofound Western Union:</p><p>\u201cWe have had considerable excitement in playing chess between this place and Baltimore for the last 2 or 3 weeks.\u2026I am inclined to think that Congress will do something for Prof Morse as very many of them appear to be very much interested with [chess].\u201d</p><p>A week later, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#LETTER_19\" target=\"_blank\">Morse wrote</a> to George M. Bibb, Secretary of the Treasury, to lobby for the funding. The telegraph could relay congressional news, presidential convention results, or the whereabouts of wanted criminals, he argued. He also played the chess card:</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two brief hand-written notes related to a telegraph chess match between the Washington Chess Club and its counterpart in Baltimore. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3865a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-brief-hand-written-notes-related-to-a-telegraph-chess-match-between-the-washington-chess-club-and-its-counterpart-in-baltimo.jpg?id=62293858&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">On 18 November 1844, the Washington Chess Club challenged Baltimore to a game of telegraph chess. One telegraph operator asked his counterpart, \u201cAre you tired of checkers?\u201d</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Institution Archives</a></small></p><p>\u201cTo show the variety of the operations of the telegraph, a game of draughts [checkers], and several games of chess, have been played between the cities of Baltimore and Washington, with the same ease as if the players were seated at the same table.\u201d</p><p>Chess had even been played on rainy nights, he noted.

Such systems, popular in France, consisted of regularly spaced flag towers that relayed messages by semaphore; they were costly to build and operate and only worked in daylight and good weather.</p><p>While Morse played up people\u2019s interest in telegraphic chess, the game itself didn\u2019t obviously begin with promotional intent. It began with checkers. We know this because Morse\u2019s associate Alfred Vail kept a \u201cJournal of the Magnetic Telegraph between Washington and Baltimore\u201d (now part of the <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214\" target=\"_blank\">Vail Telegraph Collection</a> at the Smithsonian) in which he meticulously recorded messages sent over the wire for posterity.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A hand-written note dated Nov 26 records chess moves in a game between Washington, D.C, and Baltimore \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d7781\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-hand-written-note-dated-nov-26-records-chess-moves-in-a-game-between-washington-d-c-and-baltimore.jpg?id=62293859&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Notes from a 26 November 1844 chess game record players\u2019 moves, as well as other snippets of information, such as \u201cI sent tea for Mr. Vail by 5 o\u2019clock train.\u201d</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Institution Archives</a></small></p><p>On 15 November 1844, Vail in Washington instructed Henry J. Rogers in Baltimore to \u201cget a checkerboard and let us play a game tomorrow morning.\u201d Vail promised to send instructions by regular mail on the five o\u2019clock train. At first confused, Rogers came up with the idea of using numbered squares to communicate locations on the board. Later that day, Rogers announced that John Wills, a journalist with the <em><em>Baltimore Patriot</em></em>, would play in his place.</p><p>The next morning, before the checkers game began, Vail recorded a telegraphic exchange between himself and Rogers, in which Vail suggests the game is for private enjoyment, and he would prefer that Wills\u2014a reporter\u2014not write about it:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Do you think the game any advantage R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>What game V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Checkers R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Amusement V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Don\u2019t you think people will make remarks R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>Not if it is done by ourselves V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>yes have you any objections to Wills R</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>none if he does not publish it V</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>yes R</em></p><p>Wills was thoroughly impressed with the technology, calling it \u201canother wonder of the age,\u201d according to Rogers. And so the telegraphers agreed that he could publish an account of the game, which perhaps was Vail\u2019s hope all along. The story was still being prepared for publication on 18 November when Vail tapped, \u201cThe Washington Chess Club challenge Baltimore to a game.\u201d</p><h2>How about a Nice Game of Chess?</h2><p>Vail\u2019s 1845 book about the telegraph includes <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61533/pg61533-images.html#CHESS\" target=\"_blank\">a brief report</a> on chess.

While many of the rules and conventions of chess would be familiar to modern chess players, the games were unusual in other ways. At the time, the standard way of describing chess moves was descriptive notation, says <a href=\"https://new.uschess.org/author/john-mccrary\" target=\"_blank\">John McCrary</a>, a former president of the <a href=\"https://new.uschess.org/\" target=\"_blank\">United States Chess Federation</a> who maintains a collection of some 100 chess books from <a href=\"https://chesscollectorsinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/rare-chess-book-collecting.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">before 1900</a>. For instance, \u201cpawn to queen\u2019s bishop\u2019s four\u201d described moving a pawn in front of the bishop on the queen\u2019s side of the board to the fourth row from the bottom.<p>Before the electrical telegraph, such descriptions would have been used in correspondence chess, played by mail. And <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/TheOxfordCompanionToChessFirstEditionByDavidHooperKennethWhyld/page/n355/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The Oxford Companion to Chess</em></em></a> (1984) describes a proposed 1823 match between France and England that intended to use semaphore telegraph, although the notation used was either never planned or has been lost to time.</p><p>But Vail and Rogers used a system that assigned a unique number to each of the 64 squares. So \u201cpawn to queen\u2019s bishop\u2019s four\u201d would have been rendered as \u201c11 to 27.\u201d Though the game itself can be remarkably complex, that system allowed individual moves to be communicated simply. \u201cThe exchange of information in chess is relatively low,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-kazdan-ba92968/\" target=\"_blank\">David Kazdan</a>, an engineer at <a href=\"https://case.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Case Western Reserve University</a> who has recently overseen a <a href=\"https://www.arrl.org/news/view/using-amateur-radio-to-play-chess\" target=\"_blank\">renewed collaboration</a> between the school\u2019s radio and chess clubs. \u201cYou don\u2019t need much of a communication channel to play chess.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two hand-drawn grids labeled \\u201ccheckers\\u201d and \\u201ccheckers &amp; chess,\\u201d with numbers in different squares. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2e716\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-hand-drawn-grids-labeled-u201ccheckers-u201d-and-u201ccheckers-chess-u201d-with-numbers-in-different-squares.jpg?id=62293861&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">To represent the positions on their telegraph chess board, Alfred Vail and Henry Rogers assigned a unique number to each of the 64 squares.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217214\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Institution Archives</a></small></p><p>Vail\u2019s book logs the moves for two of the chess games, and both accounts include an illegal move\u2014probably errors that were introduced later.

The sides also agreed to a limit of 10 minutes per move, even though time controls weren\u2019t common in chess, and the chess clock had not yet been invented. And while Vail wanted \u201cfirst rate players,\u201d McCrary calls the overall play weak, with a poor understanding of the long-term planning needed to coordinate all of the pieces. Both teams also made tactical errors. For example, in the second game, Washington overlooked that one of their pawns was overworked defending two other pieces simultaneously, watched as Baltimore captured one of the pieces, and elected not to retaliate in order to continue defending a more valuable knight. \u201cEven with changing conventions of that time, what was there in the description was atypical,\u201d says McCrary.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chess-computer-1920\" target=\"_self\">This 1920 Chess Automaton Was Wired to Win</a></p><p>The teams took a break during the first game and then reconvened on 28 November.

But he soon realized that a practical communications service would need an alphabetic component to spell out proper names.</p><p>This led to Morse\u2019s eponymous code, which assigns a series of short and long signals to different alphanumeric characters. By tapping on a key, telegraph operators would interrupt a battery-powered current that ran the length of the telegraph wire. At the other end, an electromagnet moved a stylus, pen, or pencil, to mark a piece of paper with the corresponding dots and dashes, which an operator would then read. (The sounder, which turned the signals into audible sounds, hadn\u2019t yet been invented.)</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">Related: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph\" target=\"_self\">Morse Code\u2019s Vanquished Competitor: The Dial Telegraph</a></p><p>During the chess games, the telegraph operators occasionally asked each other how many people were in the room. At times, a dozen kibitzers looked on. At others, only the rotating cast of chess players and telegraph operators was present.</p><h2>Telegraph Chess Moves On</h2><p>The Baltimore\u2013Washington telegraph line was an immediate hit with a general public that embraced popular science through lectures and popular books and magazines. <em><em>Scientific American</em></em> was founded in 1845, for example. But people were more curious to see the telegraph at work than they were to use its services, even though the line operated <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-week-of-the-telegraph/\" target=\"_blank\">free of charge</a> for the first year. \u201cOperators tended to show its capabilities rather than handling actual message traffic,\u201d says Hochfelder.</p><p>The lack of activity is sometimes evident in the telegraph journal. Many of the messages are purely functional (\u201cI am ready,\u201d \u201cstop 30 minutes\u201d); simple greetings; notifications of letters sent and received; or requests for daily newspapers. The Baltimore end of the telegraph was in the Mt. Clare station of the <a href=\"https://preservationmaryland.org/this-day-in-history-chartering-of-the-bo-railroad/\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;O railroad</a>, and the telegraph line ran alongside the tracks. Mail delivered by train took half a day door to door, says Hochfelder, and the telegraph offered little practical advantage.</p><p>On 5 December 1844, Rogers wrote to Vail:</p><p>\u201cI hear from several sources that we are making rather an unfavorable impression with the religious part of the community, and I am under the impression if we continue after the present party is through that we will be injured more than any benefit might or can be derived from it.\u201d</p><p>The exact nature of the religious community\u2019s complaint with telegraph chess is unclear.</p><p>Although Morse wrote to Vail on the day of the first chess game that he \u201cwas much pleased with your game of drafts,\u201d he came to feel that chess was too <a href=\"https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">frivolous</a> for the telegraph, as noted by the chess writer Tim Harding in his <a href=\"https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/correspondence-chess-in-britain-and-ireland-1824-1987/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Correspondence Chess in Britain and Ireland, 1824\u20131987</em></em></a> (McFarland, 2011)<em><em>.</em></em> Whatever the reasons, it appears that after 17 December 1844, no more chess was played on the line. And in the end, Congress didn\u2019t fund a telegraphic connection to New York, nor did it acquire perpetual rights to the telegraph, in part because Morse\u2019s business partner had other designs, says Hochfelder. The Baltimore\u2013Washington line operated under the auspices of the <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/telegraph.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Postal Service</a> from 1845 to 1847, when funding ended.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two black and white photos.

Over the next few years, companies built local lines and networks to connect cities across the country. Most notably, Ezra Cornell\u2019s Western Union completed a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-transcontinental-telegraph.htm\" target=\"_blank\">transcontinental telegraph in 1861</a>, and eventually became a monopoly in the United States. Ordinary people rarely used the telegraph, says Hochfelder, but it transformed industries such as finance and journalism.</p><p>Meanwhile, telegraph chess was taken up elsewhere. In 1845, for example, a match between London and Gosport, England, involved inventor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/morse-codes-vanquished-competitor-the-dial-telegraph\" target=\"_self\">Charles Wheatstone</a> and chess master Howard Staunton. But it would take another few decades for telechess to become more widespread, with prominent club matches <a href=\"https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1926CableChess/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">played over telegraph</a> from the 1890s into the 1920s.</p><p>High-level chess competitions tend to be held in person, but games have been played remotely from time to time. For example, in 1965, U.S. grandmaster Bobby Fischer relayed his moves <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0UJ52Gw5W4\" target=\"_blank\">by teletype</a> over telephone lines from New York City to Havana, after the U.S. State Department prevented his attending a tournament there. And in 1999, a couple of years after losing a rematch to the IBM supercomputer <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-ibms-deep-blue-beat-world-champion-chess-player-garry-kasparov\" target=\"_self\">Deep Blue</a>, world champion Garry Kasparov played a promotional game against a team representing \u201cthe world,\u201d which consulted on moves via a <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/source/1999/10/25/world-chess-champion-garry-kasparov-defeats-world-team-in-kasparov-vs-the-world-on-msn-com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft forum</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a man in a suite sitting next to a computer with a large display of a chess board. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e6618\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-man-in-a-suite-sitting-next-to-a-computer-with-a-large-display-of-a-chess-board.jpg?id=62293870&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In a promotional game in 1999, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov played an online game against \u201cthe world.\u201d </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jeff Christensen/Getty Images</small></p><p>Today, the internet has taken telecom chess to fabulous new heights, with one site alone, <a href=\"https://chess.com\" target=\"_blank\">chess.com</a>, often hosting up to 20 million games a day.

It may simply be that chess is popular, and by its nature can actually be played with short messages and perfect information, unlike soccer or poker.</p><p>But is there something more, maybe a natural affinity? \u201cThere are similarities in thinking processes [between] engineering design, and the sort of puzzle solving that a chess game involves,\u201d says Kazdan of Case Western Reserve.

Dexcom claimed the G7 to be the <a href=\"https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2022/Dexcom-G7-Receives-FDA-Clearance-The-Most-Accurate-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring-System-Cleared-in-the-U.S/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cmost accurate sensor\u201d</a> available to the thousands of people with Type 1 diabetes who use continuous glucose monitors to help manage their blood sugars. But Heller found that its real-world performance wasn\u2019t up to par. In a September 2023 post on his Substack, which is dedicated to covering Type 1 diabetes research and management, he <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/danheller/p/the-dexcom-g7-vs-g6-which-is-better?r=1q2796&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about the experience</a> and predicted an increase in adverse events with the G7, drawing on his past experience leading tech and biotech companies. <strong></strong></p><p>In the two years since Heller\u2019s experiment, many other users have reported issues with the device. Some complaints regard failed connection and deployment issues, which Dexcom claims to have <a href=\"https://www.medtechdive.com/news/dexcom-execs-fixed-g7-quality-problems/804383/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">now addressed</a>. More concerning are reports of erratic, inaccurate readings. A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1539517486772872\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public Facebook group</a> dedicated to sharing negative experiences with the G7 has grown to thousands of users, and several class action <a href=\"https://rosenlegal.com/case/dexcom-inc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuits</a> have been filed against the company, alleging <a href=\"https://wilshirelawfirm.com/dexcom-class-action-lawsuit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">false advertising</a> and <a href=\"https://cowperlaw.com/cowper-law-llp-dicello-levitt-file-class-action-against-dexcom-over-misleading-claims-about-g7-cgm/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">misleading claims</a> about device accuracy. </p><p>Yet, based on a standard metric in the industry, the G7 is one of the most accurate glucose sensors available. \u201cAccuracy in the performance of our device is our number one priority. We understand this is a lifesaving device for people with Type 1 diabetes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-c-simpson-533a083/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Simpson</a>, Dexcom\u2019s senior vice president of innovation and sensor technology, told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>. Simpson acknowledged some variability in individual sensors, but stood by the accuracy of the devices.</p><p>So why have users faced issues? In part, metrics used in marketing can be misleading compared to real world performance. Differences in study design, combined with complex biological realities, mean that the accuracy of these biosensors can\u2019t be boiled down to one number\u2014and users are learning this the hard way. </p><h2>Dexcom\u2019s Glucose Monitors</h2><p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) typically consist of a small filament inserted under the skin, a transmitter, and a receiver. The filament is coated with an enzyme that generates an electrical signal when it reacts with glucose in the fluid surrounding the body\u2019s cells. That signal is then converted to a digital signal and processed to generate glucose readings every few minutes. Each sensor lasts a week or two before needing to be replaced. <strong></strong></p><p>The technology has come a long way in recent years. In the 2010s, these devices required blood glucose calibrations twice a day and still weren\u2019t reliable enough to dose insulin based on the readings. Now, some insulin pumps use the near-real-time data to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-pancreas-could-conquer-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">automatically make adjustments</a>. With those improvements has come greater trust in the data users receive\u2014and higher standards. A faulty reading could result in a dangerous dose of insulin. </p><p>The G7 introduced several changes to Dexcom\u2019s earlier designs, including a much smaller footprint, and updated the algorithm used to translate sensor signals into glucose readings for better accuracy, Simpson says. \u201cFrom a performance perspective, we did demonstrate in a clinical trial that the G7 is significantly more accurate than the G6,\u201d he says. </p><p>So Heller and others were surprised when the new Dexcom sensor seemed to be performing worse. For some batches of sensors, it\u2019s possible that the issue was in part due to an unvalidated change in a component used in a resistive layer of the sensors. The new component showed worse performance, according to a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dexcom-inc-700835-03042025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">warning letter</a> issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2025, following an audit of two U.S. manufacturing sites. The material has since been removed from all G7 sensors, Simpson says, and the company is continuing to work with the FDA to address concerns. (\u201cThe warning letter does not restrict Dexcom\u2019s ability to produce, market, manufacture or distribute products, require recall of any products, nor restrict our ability to seek clearance of new products,\u201d Dexcom added in a statement.)</p><p>\u201c<span>There is a distribution of accuracies that have to do with people\u2019s physiology and also the devices themselves. Even in our clinical studies, we saw some that were really precise and some that had a little bit of inaccuracy to them,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cBut in general, our sensor is very accurate.\u201d</span></p><p><span>In late November Abbott\u2014one of Dexcom\u2019s main competitors\u2014<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts/early-alert-glucose-monitor-sensor-issue-abbott-diabetes-care\" target=\"_blank\">recalled some of its CGMs</a> due to inaccurate low glucose readings. The recall affects approximately 3 million sensors and was caused by an issue with one of Abbott\u2019s production lines. </span></p><p>The discrepancy between reported accuracy and user experience, however, goes beyond any one company\u2019s manufacturing missteps. </p><h2>Does MARD Matter? </h2><p>The accuracy of CGM systems is frequently measured via \u201cmean absolute relative difference,\u201d or MARD, a percentage that compares the sensor readings to laboratory blood glucose measurements. The lower the MARD, the more accurate the sensor. </p><p>This number is often used in advertising and marketing, and it has a historical relevance, says <a href=\"https://de.linkedin.com/in/manueich/de\" target=\"_blank\">Manuel Eichenlaub</a>, a biomedical engineer at the <a href=\"https://www.ifdt-ulm.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Diabetes Technology Ulm</a> in Germany, where he and his colleagues conduct independent CGM performance studies. For years, there was <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2023.0435\" target=\"_blank\">a general belief</a> that a MARD under 10 percent meant a system would be accurate enough to be used for insulin dosing. In 2018, the FDA established a specific set of accuracy <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-862/subpart-B/section-862.1355\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a> beyond MARD for insulin-guiding glucose monitors, including Dexcom\u2019s. But manufacturers design the clinical trials that determine accuracy metrics, and the way studies are designed can make a big difference. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graph comparing readings from two glucose monitors from 12 AM to 2:24 PM.

But glucose levels vary across blood compartments in the body; blood collected from capillaries with a finger prick fluctuates more and can have glucose levels around 5 to 10 percent higher than venous blood. (Dexcom tests against a gold-standard venous blood analyzer. When users see inaccuracies against home meters that use capillary blood, it could in part be a reflection of the meter\u2019s own inaccuracy, Simpson says, though he acknowledges real inaccuracies in CGMs as well.)</p><p>Additionally, the distribution of sampling isn\u2019t standardized. CGMs are known to be less accurate at the beginning and end of use, or when glucose levels are out of range or changing quickly. That means measured accuracy could be skewed by taking fewer samples right after a meal or late in the CGM\u2019s lifetime. </p><p>According to Simpson, Dexcom\u2019s trial protocol meets the FDA\u2019s expectation and tests the devices in different blood sugar ranges across the life of the sensor. \u201cWithin these clinical trials, we do stress the sensors to try and simulate those real world conditions,\u201d he says. </p><p>Dexcom and other companies advertise a MARD around 8 percent. But some independent studies are more demanding and find higher numbers; a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19322968251315459\" target=\"_blank\">head-to-head study of three popular CGMs</a> that Eichenlaub led found MARD values closer to 10 percent or higher.</p><p><span>Eichenlaub and other CGM experts believe that more standardization of testing and an extension of the FDA requirements are necessary, so they <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898125006072\" target=\"_blank\">recently proposed comprehensive guidelines</a> on CGM performance testing. </span><span>In the United States and Europe</span><span>, a few manufacturers currently dominate the market. But</span><span> newer players are entering the growing market and, especially in Europe,</span><span> may not meet the same standards as legacy manufacturers, he says</span><span>. \u201cHaving a standardized way of evaluating the performance of those systems is very important.\u201d</span></p><p>For users like Heller though, better accuracy only matters if it yields better diabetes management. \u201cI don\u2019t care about MARD. I want data that is reliably <em><em>actionable</em></em>,\u201d Heller says. He encourages engineers working on these devices to think like the patient. \u201cAt some point, there\u2019s quantitative data, but you need qualitative data.\u201d </p>"

He organizes and hosts career development workshops that teach people to create an AI agent, which can perform tasks autonomously with minimal human oversight.</p><h2>An AI career inspired by a computer</h2><p>Agrawal was born and raised in Chirgaon, a remote village in Uttar Pradesh, India. When he was growing up, no one in Chirgaon had a computer. His family owned a pharmacy, which Agrawal was expected to join after he graduated from high school. Instead, his uncle and older brother encouraged him to attend college and find his own passion.</p><p>He enjoyed mathematics and physics, and he decided to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in statistics at the <a href=\"https://www.allduniv.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Allahabad</a>. After graduating in 1996, he pursued a master\u2019s degree<strong> </strong>in statistics, statistical quality control, and operations research<strong> </strong>at the <a href=\"https://www.isical.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Statistical Institute</a> in Kolkata.</p><p>While at the ISI, he saw a computer for the first time in the laboratory of <a href=\"https://www.isical.ac.in/~nikhil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nikhil R. Pal</a>, an electronics and communication sciences professor. Pal worked on identifying abnormal clumps of cells in mammogram images using the<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/413225/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> fuzzy c-means model</a>, a data-clustering technique employing a machine learning algorithm.</p><p>Agrawal earned his master\u2019s degree in 1998. He was so inspired by Pal\u2019s work, he says, that he stayed on at the university to earn a second master\u2019s degree, in computer science.</p><p>After graduating in 2001, he joined <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Novell</a> as a senior software engineer working out of its Bengaluru office in India. He helped develop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFolder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">iFolder</a>, a storage platform that allows users across different computers to back up, access, and manage their files.</p><p>After four years, Agrawal left Novell to join Microsoft as a software design engineer, working at the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/hyderabad-campus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hyderabad campus</a> in India. He was part of a team developing a system to upgrade Microsoft\u2019s software from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">XP</a> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vista</a>.</p><p>Two years later, he was transferred to the group developing Bing, a replacement for Microsoft\u2019s Live Search, which had been launched in 2006.</p><h2>Improving Microsoft\u2019s search engine</h2><p>Live Search had a traffic rate of less than 2 percent and struggled to keep up with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>\u2019s faster-paced, more user-friendly system, Agrawal says. He was tasked with improving search results but, Agrawal says, he and his team didn\u2019t have enough user search data to train their machine learning model.</p><p>Data for location-specific queries, such as nearby coffee shops or restaurants, was especially important, he says.</p><p>To overcome those challenges, the team used deterministic algorithms to create a more structured search. Such algorithms give the same answers for any query that uses the same specific terms. The process gets results by taking keywords\u2014such as locations, dates, and prices\u2014and finding them on webpages. To help the search engine understand what users need, Agrawal developed a query clarifier that asked them to refine their search. The machine learning tool then ranked the results from most to least relevant.</p><p>To test new features before they were launched, Agrawal and his team built an online A/B experimentation platform. Controlled tests were completed on different versions of the products, and the platform ran performance and user engagement metrics, then it produced a scorecard to show changes for updated features.</p><p>Bing launched in 2009 and is now the world\u2019s second-largest search engine, according to<a href=\"https://blackraven.digital/the-rise-of-bing-and-how-it-differs-from-google/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Black Raven</a>.</p><p>Throughout his 10 years of working on the system, Agrawal upgraded it. He also worked with the advertising department to improve Microsoft\u2019s services on Bing. Ads relevant to a person\u2019s search are listed among the search results.</p><p>\u201cThe work seems easy,\u201d Agrawal says, \u201cbut behind every search engine are hundreds of engineers powering ads, query formulations, rankings, relevance, and location detection.\u201d</p><h2>Testing products before launch </h2><p>Agrawal was promoted to software development manager in 2010. Five years later he was transferred to Microsoft\u2019s Seattle offices. At the time, the company was deploying new features for existing platforms without first testing them to ensure effectiveness. Instead, they measured their performance after release, Agrawal says, and that was wreaking havoc.</p><p>He proposed using his online A/B experimentation platform on all Microsoft products, not just Bing. His supervisor approved the idea. In six months Agrawal and his team modified the tool for company-wide use. Thanks to the platform, he says, Microsoft was able to smoothly deploy up-to-date products to users.</p><p>After another two years, he was promoted to principal engineering manager of Microsoft Teams, which was facing issues with user experience, he says.</p><p>\u201cMany employees received between 50 and 100 messages a day\u2014which became overwhelming for them,\u201d Agrawal says. To lessen the stress, he led a team that developed the system\u2019s first machine learning feature: Trending. It prioritized the five most important messages users should focus on. Agrawal also led the launch of incorporating emoji reactions, screen sharing, and video calls for Teams.</p><p>In 2020 he was ready for new experiences, he says, and he left Microsoft to join Amazon as an engineering leader.</p><h2>Improved Amazon shopping</h2><p>Agrawal led an Amazon team that manually collected information about products from the company\u2019s retail catalog to create a glossary. The data, which included product dimensions, color, and manufacturer, was used to standardize the language found in product descriptions to keep listings more consistent.</p><p>That is especially important when it comes to third-party sellers, he notes. Sellers listing a product had been entering as much or as little information as they wanted. Agrawal built a system that automatically suggests language from the glossary as the seller types.</p><p>He also developed an AI algorithm that utilizes the glossary\u2019s terminology to refine search results based on what a user types into the search bar. When a shopper types \u201cred mixer,\u201d for example, the algorithm lists products under the search bar that match the description. The shopper can then click on a product from the list.</p><p>In 2023 the retailer\u2019s catalog became too large for Agrawal and his team to collect information manually, so they built an AI tool to do it for them. It became the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Catalog AI system.</p><p>After gathering information about products from around the Web, Catalog AI uses large language models to update Amazon listings with missing information, correct errors, and rewrite titles and product specifications to make them clearer for the customer, Agrawal says.</p><p>The company expects the AI tool to increase sales this year by US $7.5 billion, according to a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/amazons-ai-wants-own-online-shopping-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News report</a> in July.</p><h2>Finding purpose at IEEE</h2><p>Since Agrawal joined IEEE last December, he has been elevated to senior member and has become an active volunteer.</p><p>\u201cBeing part of IEEE has opened doors for collaboration, mentorship, and professional growth,\u201d he says. \u201cIEEE has strengthened both my technical knowledge and my leadership skills, helping me progress in my career.\u201d</p><p>Agrawal is the social media chair of the IEEE Seattle Section. He is also vice chair of the <a href=\"https://cis.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computational Intelligence Society</a>.</p><p>He was a workshop cochair for the <a href=\"https://attend.ieee.org/neweraai25/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE New Era AI World Leaders Summit</a>, which was held from 5 to 7 December in Seattle. The event brought together government and industry leaders, as well as researchers and innovators working on AI, intelligent devices, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-weapons\" target=\"_self\">unmanned aerial vehicles</a>, and similar technologies. They explored how new tools could be used in cybersecurity, the medical field, and national disaster rescue missions.</p><p>Agrawal says he stays up to date on cutting-edge technologies by peer-reviewing 15 IEEE journals.</p><p>\u201cThe organization plays a very important role in bringing authenticity to anything that it does,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a journal article has the IEEE logo, you can believe that it was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-research-integrity-process\" target=\"_self\">thoroughly and diligently reviewed</a>.\u201d</p>"

Her early life unfolded in a world defined by scarcity\u2014rationed food, intermittent electricity, and a limited ability to move up or out. But she recalls that, amid the stifling insufficiencies, she was surrounded by an irrepressible warmth and intellectual curiosity\u2014even when she was making locomotive screws in a state-run factory as part of her school\u2019s curriculum.</p><p>\u201cLife was hard,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we had great teachers and strong communities. As a child, you adapt to whatever is around you.\u201d</p><p>Her father,<a href=\"https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/teodor-rus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Teodor</a>, was a computer scientist and professor, and her mother, Elena, was a physicist.</p><p>In 1982, when she was 19, Rus\u2019s father emigrated to the United States to join the faculty at the<a href=\"https://uiowa.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Iowa</a>, in Iowa City. It was an act of courage and conviction. Within a year, Daniela and her mother joined him there.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted the freedom to think, to publish, to explore ideas,\u201d Rus says. \u201cAnd I reaped the benefits of being free from the limitations of our homeland.\u201d</p><p>America\u2019s open horizons were intoxicating, she says.</p><h2>A lecture that changed everything</h2><p>Rus decided to pursue a degree at her father\u2019s university, where her life changed direction, she says. One afternoon, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hopcroft_1053917.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John Hopcroft</a>\u2014a<a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Turing Award</a>\u2013winning <a href=\"https://www.cornell.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell</a> computer scientist renowned for his work on algorithms and data structures\u2014gave a talk on campus. His message was simple but electrifying, Rus says: Classical computer science had been solved. The next frontier, Hopcroft declared, was computations that interact with the messy physical world.</p><p>For Rus, the idea was a revelation.</p><p>\u201cIt was as if a door had opened,\u201d she says. \u201cI realized the future of computing wasn\u2019t just about logic and code; it was about how machines can perceive, move, and help us in the real world.\u201d</p><p>After the lecture, she introduced herself to Hopcroft and told him she wanted to learn from him. Not long after earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and mathematics in 1985, she applied to get a master\u2019s degree at Cornell, where Hopcroft became her graduate advisor. Rus developed algorithms there for dexterous <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/minimally-actuated-robot-arm-has-lots-of-joints-just-one-clever-motor\" target=\"_self\">robotic manipulation</a>\u2014teaching machines to grasp and move objects with precision. She earned her master\u2019s in computer science in 1990, then stayed on at Cornell to work toward a doctorate.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI like to think of robotics as a way to give people superpowers. Machines can help us reach farther, think faster, and live fuller lives.\u201d</p><p>In 1993 she earned her Ph.D. in computer science, then took a position as an assistant professor of computer science at <a href=\"https://home.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Dartmouth College</a>, in Hanover, N.H. She founded the college\u2019s robotics laboratory and expanded her work into distributed robotics. She developed teams of small robots that cooperated to perform tasks such as ensuring products in warehouses are correctly gathered to fulfill orders, get packaged safely, and are routed to their respective destinations efficiently.</p><p>Despite a lack of traditional machine shop facilities for fabrication on the Hanover campus, Rus found a way. She pioneered the use of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/printable-robots-mit-project\" target=\"_self\"> 3D printing to rapidly prototype and build robots</a>.</p><p>In 2003 she left Dartmouth to become a professor in the<a href=\"https://www.eecs.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> electrical engineering and computer science</a> department at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>.</p><p>The robotics lab she created at Dartmouth moved with her to MIT and became known as the <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Distributed Robotics Laboratory</a> (DRL). In 2012 she was named director of MIT\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school\u2019s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups including the DRL. She also continues to serve as the DRL\u2019s principal investigator.</p><h2>The science of physical intelligence</h2><p>Rus now leads pioneering research at the intersection of AI and robotics, a field she calls <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">physical intelligence</a>. It\u2019s \u201ca new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time,\u201d <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>.</p><p>Her lab builds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robots-for-hard-problems\" target=\"_self\">soft-body robots inspired by nature</a> that can sense, adapt, and learn. They are AI-driven systems that passively handle tasks\u2014such as self-balancing and complex articulation similar to that done by the human hand\u2014because their shape and materials minimize the need for heavy processing.</p><p>Such machines, she says, someday will be able to navigate different environments, perform useful functions without external control, and even recover from disturbances to their route planning. Researchers also are exploring ways to make them more energy-efficient.</p><p>One prototype developed by Rus\u2019s team is designed to retrieve foreign objects from the body, including batteries swallowed by children. The ingestible robots are artfully folded, similar to origami, so they are small enough to be swallowed. Embedded magnetic materials allow doctors to steer the soft robots and control their shape. Upon arriving in the stomach, a soft bot can be programmed to wrap around a foreign object and guide it safely out of the patient\u2019s body.</p><p>CSAIL researchers also are working on small robots that can carry a medication and release it at a specific area within the digestive tract, bypassing the stomach acid known to diminish some drugs\u2019 efficacy. Ingestible robots also could patch up internal injuries or ulcers. And because they\u2019re made from digestible materials such as sausage casings and biocompatible polymers, the robots can perform their assigned tasks and then get safely absorbed by the body, she says.</p><p>Health care isn\u2019t the only application on the horizon for such AI-driven technologies. Robots with physical intelligence might someday help firefighters locate people trapped in burning buildings, find miners after a cave-in, and provide valuable situational awareness information to emergency response teams in the aftermath of natural disasters, Rus says.</p><p>\u201cWhat excites me is the possibility of giving people new powers,\u201d she says. \u201cMachines that can think and move safely in the physical world will let us extend human reach\u2014at work, at home, in medicine \u2026 everywhere.\u201d</p><p>To make such a vision a reality, she has expanded her technical interests to include several complementary lines of research.</p><p>She\u2019s working on self-reconfiguring and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stochastic-robots-assemble-and-disassemble-themselves\" target=\"_self\">modular robots</a> such as MIT\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/m-blocks-modular-robotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M-Blocks</a> and NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/superbot-modular-multifunctional-reconfigurable-robot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SuperBots</a>, which can attach, detach, and rearrange themselves to form shapes suited for different actions such as slithering, climbing, and crawling.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nyu-tandon-robotics\" target=\"_self\">networked robots</a>\u2014including those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&amp;hvadid=675149237887&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13161685782168516493&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004281&amp;hvtargid=kwd-10573980&amp;ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&amp;hydadcr=28883_14649097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> uses in its warehouses\u2014thousands of machines can operate as a large adaptive system. The machines communicate continuously to divide tasks, avoid collisions, and optimize package routing.</p><p>Rus\u2019s team also is making advances in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/human-robot-interaction\" target=\"_self\">human-robot interaction</a>, such as reading brainwave activity and <a href=\"https://www.josephdelpreto.com/portfolio/detect-sign-language-with-a-smart-glove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interpreting sign language through a smart glove</a>.</p><p>To further her plan of putting all the computerized smarts the robots need within their physical bodies instead of in the cloud, she helped found <a href=\"https://www.liquid.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid AI</a> in 2023. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., develops <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/liquid-neural-networks\" target=\"_self\">liquid neural networks</a>, inspired by the simple brains of worms, that can learn and adapt continuously. The word <em><em>liquid</em></em> in this case refers to the adaptability, flexibility, and dynamic nature of the team\u2019s model architecture. It can change shape and adapt to new data inputs, and it fits within constraints imposed by the hardware in which it\u2019s contained, she says.</p><h2>Finding community in IEEE</h2><p>Rus joined IEEE at one of its robotics conferences when she was a graduate student.</p><p>\u201cI think I signed up just to get the student discount,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut IEEE turned out to be the place where my community lived.\u201d</p><p>She credits the organization\u2019s conferences, journals, and collaborative spirit with shaping her professional growth.</p><p>\u201cThe exchange of ideas, the chance to test your thinking against others\u2014it\u2019s invaluable,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s how our field moves forward.\u201d</p><p>Rus continues to serve on IEEE panels and committees, mentoring the next generation of roboticists.</p><p>\u201cIEEE gave me a platform,\u201d Rus says. \u201cIt taught me how to communicate, how to lead, and how to dream bigger.\u201d</p><h2>Living the American dream</h2><p>Looking back, Rus sees her story as a testament to unforeseen possibilities.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was growing up in Romania, I couldn\u2019t even imagine living in America,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I\u2019m here, working with brilliant students, building robots that help people, and trying to make a difference. I feel like I\u2019m living the American dream.\u201d</p><p>In a nod to a memorable song from the Broadway musical <a href=\"https://hamiltonmusical.com/new-york/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Hamilton</em></em></a>, Rus echoes <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/alexander-hamilton.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Hamilton</a>\u2019s determination to make the most of his opportunities, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to throw away my shot.\u201d</p>"

Seventy of the 279 IEEE milestones that have been granted were to technologies developed in Region 1, noted its director,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IEEEDay/videos/mr-bala-prasanna-ieee-region-1-director-a-special-note-from-prasanna-honoring-th/1144637610962126/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Bala Prasanna</a>, an IEEE life senior member.</p><p>\u201cBell Labs stands at the heart of that legacy,\u201d Prasanna said.<a href=\"https://nextg.princeton.edu/2025-symposium-speakers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p><p>IEEE Life Member <a href=\"https://www.wevolver.com/profile/emad.farag\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Emad Farag</a>, chair of the <a href=\"https://r1.ieee.org/northjersey/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE North Jersey Section</a>, said, \u201cThis section has given birth to technology that is at the heart of modern life.\u201d</p><h2>Molecular beam epitaxy </h2><p>The high-purity crystal growth process called <em><em>molecular beam epitaxy</em></em> (MBE) was developed by IEEE Fellow <a href=\"https://www.invent.org/inductees/alfred-y-cho\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alfred Y. Cho</a> in the 1960s. Used to grow thin films of crystal atop one another, the process makes possible <a href=\"https://mwe.ee.ethz.ch/research/HEMT.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">high-electron mobility transistors</a>, <a href=\"https://spie.org/publications/spie-publication-resources/optipedia-free-optics-information/fg12_p40_vcsel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers</a> (VCSELs), and other technologies.</p><p>With MBE, ultrapure elements such as gallium and arsenic are heated within the side compartments of a vacuum chamber. Inside the chamber sits a heated target semiconductor wafer. The elements sublimate, evaporating and flying at the target wafer, where they attach and combine, slowly growing into a layer of crystal.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds straightforward, but it\u2019s difficult to get it right,\u201d said IEEE Fellow <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/people/david-neilson/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Nielson</a>, group leader for optical transmission at Bell Labs. \u201cThe thermodynamics going on at the surface in MBE is incredibly complex.\u201d</p><p>VCSELs are dependent on MBE, Nielson noted. They rely on multiple vertical semiconductor layers to form internal reflectors and other structures. VCSELs are key to the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/face-recognition\" target=\"_self\">facial recognition</a> systems used to unlock smartphones today. The tiny array of lasers paints your face with a pattern of dots to create a 3D map.</p><p>Because MBE happens one atomic layer at a time and under clean-room conditions, it gives scientists unprecedented control over the thickness, composition, and purity of each layer\u2014similar to 3D printing but at the nanometer scale, according to the <a href=\"https://uiowa.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Iowa</a> physics and astronomy department\u2019s <a href=\"https://physics.uiowa.edu/molecular-beam-epitaxy-lab#:~:text=Growth%20materials%20include%20Ga%2C%20Al,6%2C000%2Dgallon%20liquid%20nitrogen%20tank.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MBE Lab</a>.</p><p>Building up enough layers to make a useful device\u2014a process that happens at the glacial pace of 1 micrometer (or less) per hour\u2014was a test of Bell Labs scientists\u2019 patience and determination, Nielson said.</p><p>\u201cIn the lab, we used to say MBE didn\u2019t just stand for <em><em>molecular beam epitaxy</em></em>; it also meant <em><em>many boring evenings</em></em>,\u201d he joked.</p><p>The scientists\u2019 steadfast attention and patience paid off.</p><p>\u201cIt unlocked all sorts of new materials,\u201d Nielson said. \u201cIt allows you to build materials that don\u2019t naturally exist. Some of the impacts in the scientific domain include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_quantum_Hall_effect\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fractional quantum Hall effects</a>\u2014another Bell Labs innovation being celebrated today.\u201d</p><p>As Cho recounted in a <a href=\"https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/06/102702406-05-01-acc.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2010 interview</a> for the <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer History Museum</a>\u2019s oral history series, he began working at the Murray Hill facility in 1968. His colleague <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Arthur_Jr.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John R. Arthur Jr.</a> soon proposed a new approach to fine-tuning the semiconductor formulations: Evaporate pure elements such as gallium and arsenic in an ultrahigh vacuum, then let the resulting molecular beams travel unimpeded, allowing them to condense on a heated crystalline substrate. Cho said in the oral history that Arthur\u2019s idea inspired him to connect insights gleaned from research papers, lectures, and his own graduate work.</p><p>When asked how he invented what became known as MBE, he described it as \u201clinking ideas from one field to another to create something entirely new.\u201d</p><p>Cho understood how early effusion cells (the combustion chambers in which the elements are heated until they break down into their molecular or atomic components) and cesium ion emitters (which improve the orderliness of the atomic layering) worked in an ultrahigh vacuum.</p><p>He applied that knowledge, along with his background in surface physics\u2014the understanding of how to monitor and assess the quality of the atomic layers through <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/electron-diffraction\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">electron diffraction</a> and how to remove oxides to clean surfaces\u2014to the growth of semiconductor materials. By connecting surface physics, ion engines, and crystal growth, he helped create a new field, he said in the oral history.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cHistory gives us context. It reminds us why we do what we do.\u201d <strong>\u2014IEEE President Kathleen Kramer</strong></p><p>By the end of 1968, he and Arthur had built the first experimental MBE system. Their 1969 Bell Labs technical memo and follow-up <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Applied Physics Letters</em></em></a> paper documented the first high-quality gallium arsenide layers with atomically sharp interfaces\u2014something no other technique could achieve. What astonished their colleagues was the repeatability: By controlling shutter timing, temperature, and beam flux\u2014the rate at which elements evaporate and their atoms flow toward the target wafer\u2014they could reproduce identical structures repeatedly.</p><p>The invention had all the hallmarks of the Bell Labs tradition: a simple question pursued with rigor, a culture that valued exploration over deadlines, and an audacious belief that even the smallest layer of matter could be engineered to perfection.</p><p>The IEEE Milestone plaque honoring MBE reads:</p><p><em><em>\u201cIn 1968\u20131970, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) techniques using reflection high-energy electron diffraction for growing epitaxial compound semiconductor films were introduced.

Their concept, sketched amid a one-hour conversation, would become the <a href=\"https://mcdonaldobservatory.org/research/instruments/charged-coupled-devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">charge-coupled device</a>, or CCD\u2014a breakthrough that, as <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Scientific American</em></em></a> noted in its <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/issue/sa/1974/02-01/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">February 1974 issue</a>, seemed poised to improve TV cameras and astronomical imaging. It eventually ushered in the digital photography revolution and changed how scientists see the universe.</p><p>At the time, Bell Labs was in one of its most fertile phases, having already given the world the transistor, the laser, and information theory. The company was turning its attention to solid-state imaging and memory\u2014technologies it hoped might one day support the burgeoning field of electronic communications. Boyle, then head of the device concepts department, and Smith, a physicist known for his intuitive design skills, were exploring how to create a new kind of semiconductor memory.</p><p>The spark came partly from internal competition. As Smith recalled during his Nobel lecture, Bell Labs\u2019 Electronics division had two groups: William Boyle\u2019s semiconductor department and another department which handled all other technologies. Under pressure to advance magnetic bubble memory, vice president Jack Morton urged Boyle\u2019s group to develop a competing semiconductor device or see resources shift to the other group.</p><p>\u201cTo address this demand, on October 17, 1969, Bill and I got together in his office,\u201d Smith <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/smith_lecture.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">later explained</a>. \u201cIn a discussion lasting not much more than an hour, the basic structure of the CCD was sketched out on the blackboard, the principles of operation defined, and some preliminary ideas concerning applications were developed,\u201d he said.</p><p>According to Bell Labs\u2019 internal technical reports, the essence of their idea was that a grid of capacitors that could hold and shift electrical charges, one to the next, in a controlled sequence. The charge-coupled device would store data.</p><p>The CCD\u2019s image-capture capability was an accidental discovery, Sizer said during his presentation at the Milestone ceremony.</p><p>Boyle and Smith were testing the CCD for use as a memory circuit \u201cwhen they noticed that light in the room flipped bits in the device,\u201d Sizer said. \u201cThat accident connected light and information\u2014and turned a memory circuit into an imaging sensor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday the essence of that blackboard sketch lives in every smartphone camera. The CCD turned light into data. It taught machines to see.\u201d</p><p>Within weeks, Boyle and Smith had a working prototype, which under laboratory lamps produced a faint but discernible pattern\u2014a \u201cghostly image,\u201d as Smith later described it.</p><p>Bell Labs quickly organized teams to refine the fabrication process, improve signal-to-noise ratio, and explore an array of uses including in video cameras and data storage arrays.</p><p>Management appeared to recognize the potential almost immediately, though commercial products were still years away. As noted at the time by former Bell Labs president <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Mervin_J._Kelly\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mervin J. Kelly</a>, the CCD fit squarely within the institution\u2019s mission: pushing the frontiers of solid-state electronics to strengthen communication systems.</p><p>\u201cAT&amp;T\u2019s <em><em>Bell Labs News</em></em> wrote that it could be used in a small color TV camera for future videophones\u2014a remarkably clairvoyant prediction,\u201d Sizer said.</p><p>By the mid-1970s, companies including <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Fairchild-Semiconductor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fairchild Semiconductor</a>,<a href=\"https://www.rca.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> RCA</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sony</a> had taken the concept further, producing the first CCD video cameras and astronomical imagers, according to the <a href=\"https://www.digitalkameramuseum.de/en/history#:~:text=1973%20%2D%20Fairchild%20CCD,with%20an%20array%20of%20480x390px.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Camera Museum</a>.</p><p>The device soon found its way into camcorders, telescopes, fax machines, and medical instruments. By the 1990s, CCDs had become the gold standard for digital imaging.</p><p>When Boyle and Smith received <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 2009, they credited the company\u2019s culture for their success.</p><p>\u201cBell Labs gave us the freedom to think in any direction,\u201d Smith said in an interview about the Nobel Prize. \u201cThat was its genius.\u201d</p><p>The IEEE Milestone plaque honoring the CCD reads:</p><p><em><em>\u201cThe charge-coupled device (CCD), originally conceived for digital memory applications, was later shown to offer a compact, sensitive, and efficient way to convert light into digital signals by storing light-generated charges in a series of tiny capacitors.

But Betzig suspected there was a way around it. His idea was radical for its time: If a single fluorescent molecule could be detected, he theorized, then perhaps an image could be built one molecule at a time, with each point localized far more precisely than the laws of optics previously seemed to allow.</p><p>Bell Labs continued to evolve through the 1990s, yet remained one of the world\u2019s great research institutions. The<a href=\"https://www.fjc.gov/history/spotlight-judicial-history/breakup-ma-bell\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> breakup of AT&amp;T</a> ushered in a more commercially aware era. As a result, researchers were asked to balance blue-sky curiosity with a clearer line of sight to practical applications.</p><p>For Betzig and other researchers, whose passion leaned toward fundamental physics rather than communications or materials science, that balance was hard to strike, according to a 2012 <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/7106285/like-building-refrigerators-bell-labs-and-the-end-of-game-changing-innovation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Time</em></em> magazine article</a> written by <a href=\"https://journalism.princeton.edu/people/jon-gertner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Gertner</a>, adapted from his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</em></em></a>.</p><p>The lab did not become hostile to discovery. Far from it. But management steered toward projects that promised tangible short-term returns in telecommunications and optoelectronics, Gertner said.</p><p>Betzig\u2019s work on single-molecule fluorescence, while elegant, was difficult to justify within the emerging priorities.

Physicist <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2014/hell/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">Stefan W. Hell</a>, an IEEE member, began publishing papers describing his <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-024-00335-1\" target=\"_blank\">stimulated emission depletion</a> (STED) microscopy technique. It used a laser to make fluorescent molecules glow and a second, donut-shape laser to suppress fluorescence everywhere except a nanometer-scale central point so that telescopes could resolve features much smaller than half a wavelength.</p><p>Hell\u2019s technique was among several advances in microscopy that spurred Betzig to resume his career in science. He joined the <a href=\"https://www.janelia.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Janelia Research Campus</a>, in Ashburn, Va., where he continued his research.</p><p>Together <a href=\"https://www.invent.org/sites/default/files/2024-01/2024_Fact_Sheet_Harald_Hess.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with Harald Hess</a>, another Bell Labs alumnus, Betzigl developed a working prototype demonstrating the feasibility of his microscopy method, which he called <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408726/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">photoactivated localization microscopy</a>, or PALM.

St\u00f6rmer</a> watched a set of electrical traces appear on an oscilloscope that defied every expectation.

The pattern that emerged showed \u201cbeautiful, clean plateaus in Hall resistance, but at fractional values of e<span>2</span>/h\u201d\u2014the fundamental constant, where <em><em>e</em></em> represents the electrons\u2019 charge and <em><em>h</em></em> equals <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/Plancks-constant\" target=\"_blank\">Planck\u2019s constant</a>, the value of the smallest possible discrete packets of energy at atomic and subatomic scales, according to <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/stormer-lecture.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">St\u00f6rmer\u2019s Nobel lecture</a> in 1998.</p><p>To St\u00f6rmer and his colleague <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/tsui/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel C. Tsui</a>, it was a moment both thrilling and disorienting. The electrons should have behaved like independent particles. Instead they were somehow acting as if they had split into smaller, correlated entities: quasiparticles with fractional charge. The phenomenon had no place in classical theory\u2014at least not yet.</p><p>The discovery of the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/9580-practice-and-theory/\" target=\"_blank\">fractional quantum Hall effect</a> (FQHE) led to \u201cthe development of new theoretical concepts of significance in many branches of modern physics,\u201d as stated by the <a href=\"https://www.kva.se/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> in the news release announcing that <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/press-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">St\u00f6rmer and Tsui had been named Nobel laureates</a>.

Something entirely new was happening.</p><p>At first, neither St\u00f6rmer nor Tsui could believe the measurements. The duo was surprised by the data they were seeing, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/press-release/#:~:text=In%20their%20refined%20experimental%20studies,the%20fractional%20quantum%20Hall%20effect.\" target=\"_blank\">news release</a> announcing that they had been named Nobel laureates.

Yet repeated experiments confirmed the result.</p><p>Within weeks, the pair had a preprint ready for <em><em>Physical Review Letters.</em></em> It was published in November 1982.</p><p>The theoretical explanation came soon after, from <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1998/laughlin/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert B. Laughlin</a>, then a young theorist at <a href=\"https://www.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford</a>. In a landmark 1983 <em><em>Physical Review Letters</em></em> paper, Laughlin explained theoretically what the Bell Labs researchers were seeing with their experiments. Laughlin proposed that under extreme magnetic fields and low temperatures, electrons could condense into a new collective quantum state\u2014a \u201cliquidlike state of matter\u201d (such as a <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/54667-bose-einstein-condensate.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bose-Einstein condensate</a>)\u2014supporting subatomic particles carrying a fraction of the electron\u2019s charge.

With this hardware in place, the youngsters dialed in to an off-site minicomputer.</p><p>The teenagers called themselves the RESISTORS, a retronym (they picked the moniker first and then matched words to the letters) for \u201cRadically Emphatic Students Interested in Science, Technology, Or Research Studies.\u201d The trade publication <em><em>Computerworld</em></em> gave the RESISTORS front-page billing\u2014\u201cStudents Steal Show as Conference Opens\u201d\u2014and noted how the group drew a \u201cfascinated crowd\u201d of computer professionals.

But the previously untold history of the RESISTORS highlights the fact that, years before there were machines called personal computers, some people regularly accessed computers for activities unrelated to their professional lives. Motives varied, but entertainment as well as the display of technical prowess mattered. Just as important, the story of the RESISTORS expands our sense of the hobbyist community beyond later and better-known groups like the Bay Area\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/personal-computers/17/312\" target=\"_blank\">Homebrew Computer Club</a>.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><h2>An early computer club for teens </h2><p>Fewer than 70 kids claimed membership in the RESISTORS over the group\u2019s roughly decade-long existence. Nonetheless, a surprisingly large number of them went on to have careers in technology and science. Two members wrote books about computing that would sell millions of copies. Another member cofounded <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco Systems</a>, which got its start manufacturing Internet routers and other networking hardware and is now a multibillion-dollar business. Others became college professors or professional programmers. And starting around 1969, the RESISTORS became linked to computer pioneer <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ted-nelson-on-what-modern-programmers-can-learn-from-the-past\" target=\"_self\">Ted Nelson</a> (more on that later).</p><p>An engineer named <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/claude-kagan\" target=\"_blank\">Claude Kagan </a>was the nucleus around which the RESISTORS first organized. Born in 1924 in Orval, France, Kagan moved to the United States as a teen, served in the army, and earned an M.S. from <a href=\"https://www.cornell.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell University</a> in 1950. He took a position with Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T, and in 1958, he moved to Hopewell Township, N.J., a short drive from Princeton.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of men in suits talking and sitting around a square table. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"74fe8\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-men-in-suits-talking-and-sitting-around-a-square-table.jpg?id=62293590&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Electrical engineer Claude Kagan [second from left] encouraged the RESISTORS to learn computing, using the large collection of used equipment stored in his barn. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chuck Ehrlich</small></p><p>Kagan\u2019s specialty was high-level computer languages, such as Fortran and BASIC, in which programmers write code that is largely independent of the particular type of computer. He was also an inveterate collector of old computers and other electronics, which he stored in a large red barn on his property that was also home to some donkeys and malamutes.</p><p>Chuck Ehrlich, one of the original RESISTORS and later an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, recalls that in late 1966, he and a small group of \u201cbrainy social outcasts\u201d were looking for some sort of clubhouse. The kids weren\u2019t interested in smoking pot or social protests, and they were disenchanted with the science classes offered at their local schools. But they were into electronics.</p><p>Kagan knew one of the teens\u2019 fathers and offered to let the group use his barn. They soon discovered Kagan\u2019s collection of artifacts, including a surplus IBM paper tape punch, some analog telephone equipment, and a <a href=\"https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/flexo/tour.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Friden Flexowriter</a> (a kind of heavy-duty typewriter that could be linked to a computer).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A color photo of a 1950s mainframe computer in a room filled with assorted junk. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"93678\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-color-photo-of-a-1950s-mainframe-computer-in-a-room-filled-with-assorted-junk.jpg?id=62293697&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A color photo of a 1950s mainframe computer in a room filled with assorted junk. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cf545\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-color-photo-of-a-1950s-mainframe-computer-in-a-room-filled-with-assorted-junk.jpg?id=62299217&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The first computer the RESISTORS used was a Burroughs Datatron 205 mainframe, which occupied most of two walls in Kagan\u2019s barn.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">David Gesswein</small></p><p>But the main attraction for the teens were Kagan\u2019s computers. The most imposing of these was a <a href=\"https://tjsawyer.com/B205home.php\" target=\"_blank\">Burroughs Datatron 205</a>, a computer first manufactured in the mid-1950s and based on vacuum tubes. The enormous machine weighed several tons, and stories circulated about how Kagan had borrowed a tractor trailer to heroically transport the behemoth from Michigan to New Jersey.</p><p>Only slightly less imposing was an inoperable <a href=\"https://s3data.computerhistory.org/brochures/packardbell.hycomp250.1961.102646194.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Packard Bell PB250</a>, a refrigerator-size computer of more recent vintage that the teens managed to get working. Kagan also allowed the teens to connect to his employer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/minicomputers/11/331\" target=\"_blank\">DEC PDP-8</a> machine via teletype over phone lines so they could run programs written in <a href=\"https://www.resistors.org/index.php/The_RESISTORS_and_Trac\" target=\"_blank\">TRAC</a> (Text Reckoning And Compiling). Developed starting in 1959 by computer scientist <a href=\"https://garfield.library.upenn.edu/commentaries/tsv11(06)p09y19970317.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Calvin Mooers</a>, TRAC was an efficient language amenable to being run on machines that had relatively little memory. The teens were fond of connecting to the off-site computer and accessing a version of Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/365153.365168\" target=\"_blank\">ELIZA chatbot</a> program.</p><p>Being able to work with computers interactively and in real time was generally unavailable to nonprofessional computer users at the time. Kagan eventually persuaded the Digital Equipment Corp. to donate a PDP-8\u2014no trivial gift, as new models sold for US $15,000 or more\u2014which the RESISTORS worked with in the barn.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a donkey peering out of a barn window at a seated young man adjusting some equipment.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"909ed\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-donkey-peering-out-of-a-barn-window-at-a-seated-young-man-adjusting-some-equipment.jpg?id=62302124&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">One of the donkeys in Claude Kagan\u2019s barn looks on as RESISTOR Doug Timbie works on some equipment.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">John A. Pietras/The Evening Times; Trenton Free Public Library</small></p><p>The bargain Kagan struck with the RESISTORS was unusual for several reasons. First, Kagan was gay, a fact that the teens (and their parents) were aware of but which, by all accounts, bothered no one. When the Hopewell Valley Jaycee-ettes held a house tour in April 1966, the brochure encouraged people to visit Kagan\u2019s \u201cunique bachelor setting\u201d that he shared with artist George Furnish. Furnish passed away around the time the RESISTORS were forming, and the grieving Kagan assumed multiple roles for the group: guru, mentor, publicity agent, and landlord. Kagan provided the space, while the teens were responsible for maintaining both it and the equipment as well as covering the cost of electricity.</p><p>Most amateur computer clubs of the era were masculine spaces, but photographs of the RESISTORS almost always show one or more young women working at a terminal or solving a programming problem. When it came to deciding whose turn it was to use a machine, <a href=\"https://cals.cornell.edu/people/jean-hunter\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Hunter</a>\u2014later a professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell\u2014likened it to social time-sharing that required \u201cbeating people over the head to make them give you a turn.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.johnlevine.com/about.phtml\" target=\"_blank\">John R. Levine</a>, who was a RESISTOR before studying computer science at Yale and later coauthoring the bestseller <a href=\"https://www.dummies.com/book/technology/internet-basics/the-internet-for-dummies-14th-edition-281740/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The</em></em> <em><em>Internet for Dummies</em></em></a>, recalled, \u201cWe were so nerdy that it didn\u2019t occur to us that girls [would] be any different in terms of what they could do.\u201d</p><p>There were also efforts to recruit African American teens from schools in Trenton. One of these kids, Joseph Tulloch, provided quirky, Dr. Seuss-like illustrations for a programming manual that Kagan and the teens assembled and published. Tulloch later became a programmer for the state of New Jersey.</p><p>New members were initiated into the group by having an omega sign, the engineer\u2019s symbol for electrical resistance, drawn on their face with a Magic Marker (these were teenagers after all). One of the first things a new member would learn was how to use TRAC to write programs. For his part, Kagan held a dim view of traditional learning as practiced in local classrooms. He instead insisted that the RESISTORS learn by doing. The group\u2019s pedagogical approach came from the African American motto \u201cEach one, teach one.\u201d As one member recalled, \u201cIf you want to teach someone how to do something, you had to let them sit at the keyboard.\u201d</p><p>The RESISTORS\u2019 location in the Princeton area contributed to their success. Several members had parents employed at nearby technology companies, such as AT&amp;T and RCA. Others, such as Nat Kuhn, had parents who worked at <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Princeton University</a>. Kuhn\u2019s father was Thomas Kuhn, a historian and author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em></em></a> (1962), the landmark book that introduced \u201cparadigm shift\u201d into the vernacular.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A black and white photo of a young boy who is smiling and pointing a pen device at a computer screen. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ce0d7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-and-white-photo-of-a-young-boy-who-is-smiling-and-pointing-a-pen-device-at-a-computer-screen.jpg?id=62293602&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Twelve-year-old Nat Kuhn was just 10 when he joined the RESISTORS. \u201cI was super geeky,\u201d he later recalled. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">David Fox</small></p><p>As a kid, Nat built devices from hobbyist electronics kits with his father, a former physicist. Nat joined the RESISTORS after attending an open house the group sponsored in February 1968 at the Princeton Junior Museum. He was just 10 years old at the time. \u201cI was super geeky,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand the computer became my hobby and obsession. You could understand things through it and make things happen.\u201d</p><p>Soon after Nat had his face inked with an omega sign, another person, much older but just as passionate about personal computing, started showing up at Claude Kagan\u2019s barn.</p><h2>Ted Nelson and the birth of hypertext</h2><p>Ted Nelson had majored in philosophy at Swarthmore College, graduating in 1959, and then studied sociology at the University of Chicago and later Harvard, where he took his first computer course. Nelson\u2019s 2010 autobiography includes a whole chapter, titled \u201cThe Epiphany of Ted Nelson,\u201d about this revelatory experience. When he realized that the computer, instead of a dreary number-crunching device, \u201ccould be whatever it was programmed to be,\u201d his \u201cworld exploded.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A person stands at a 1970s printer, holding a paper while wearing a white shirt and striped tie.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e4cce\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-stands-at-a-1970s-printer-holding-a-paper-while-wearing-a-white-shirt-and-striped-tie.jpg?id=62299163&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ted Nelson met the RESISTORS in the late 1960s, when he was developing his ideas around hypertext and globally interconnected networks for publishing.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ted Nelson</small></p><p>Nelson had a penchant for writing, and so an even bigger revelation was that computers could handle text by manipulating, storing, printing, and, above all, displaying it on screens. And, if this could be done with text, it could probably also be done with images and sound. \u201cThe future of mankind was at the computer screen,\u201d he decided, as the \u201cinteractive computer would become the workplace of the future.\u201d</p><p>Equally profound for Nelson was recognizing that once a person had text on a computer screen, they could use it to construct parallel, nonsequential textual passages. These word assemblages could then be linked to one another or branch off in entirely new directions\u2014a farsighted idea for the time.</p><p>In 1964, Nelson accepted a teaching position at Vassar College, where his new colleagues invited him to describe how the future of work and artistic creativity would happen on computer screens. In the promotional flyer for the talk, he introduced a new word: hypertext.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white drawing of a Superman-like figure flying toward a rectangular opening, with the words Dream Machine at top.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f50f9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-drawing-of-a-superman-like-figure-flying-toward-a-rectangular-opening-with-the-words-dream-machine-at-top.jpg?id=62299307&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Some of the ideas that Ted Nelson discussed with the RESISTORS later turned up in Nelson\u2019s opus Computer Lib/Dream Machines.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Microsoft Press</small></p><p>As Nelson defined it in <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800197.806036\" target=\"_blank\">a 1965 paper</a>, hypertext meant \u201ca body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.\u201d Almost any topic could, in principle, be represented on a computer screen with \u201clinks\u201d connecting one entry to another, along with annotation, footnotes, and summaries, while also including \u201cevery feature a novelist or absent-minded professor could want.\u201d</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED VIDEO: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ted-nelson-on-what-modern-programmers-can-learn-from-the-past\" target=\"_blank\">Ted Nelson on What Modern Programmers Can Learn From the Past</a></p><p>Nelson imagined that his system of information storage, retrieval, and documentation could \u201cgrow indefinitely,\u201d containing more and more of the world\u2019s knowledge while revealing important connections between all of the entries.</p><p>Nelson soon quit Vassar and started raising money and his professional profile. His goal was to design and implement a universal text handling, publishing, and globally connected electronic library system, which he named <a href=\"https://www.xanadu.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Xanadu</a>, from Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s \u201cKubla Khan.\u201d (It\u2019s also the name of Charles Foster Kane\u2019s mansion in Orson Welles\u2019s 1941 classic, <em><em>Citizen Kane</em></em>.) Xanadu would turn into Nelson\u2019s lifelong obsession.</p><h2>A convergence of art and computers</h2><p>The catalyst that brought Nelson together with Claude Kagan and the RESISTORS wasn\u2019t some new computer but an avant-garde art show. In the fall of 1970, a lavish new exhibition titled <a href=\"https://www.artforum.com/events/software-234492/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Software</em></em></a> opened at the <a href=\"https://thejewishmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jewish Museum</a> in New York City. Museum director <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/03/archives/jewish-museum-finds-its-new-director-brooklynborn-karl-katz-in.html\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Katz</a> handpicked the influential art theorist <a href=\"https://monoskop.org/Jack_Burnham\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Burnham</a> to curate the show. Burnham, in turn, was inspired by <a href=\"https://museum.dataart.com/short-stories/norbert-wiener\" target=\"_blank\">Norbert Wiener</a>\u2019s cybernetic concepts and wanted to explore how conceptual artists might experiment with new computing technologies, such as \u201creal-time computing\u201d and \u201cinteractivity,\u201d in a gallery setting. The exhibition gave thousands of visitors an opportunity to see, and in some cases use, minicomputers, teletype equipment, high-speed copy machines, and closed-circuit television.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo shows 3 teenagers looking at a 1960s computer terminal.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b1ac\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-shows-3-teenagers-looking-at-a-1960s-computer-terminal.jpg?id=62293557&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo shows a large room decorated with hand-written posters and people seated at tables. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d247c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-shows-a-large-room-decorated-with-hand-written-posters-and-people-seated-at-tables.jpg?id=62293556&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">When the Jewish Museum launched an ambitious art and tech exhibition in 1970, members of the RESISTORS collaborated with artists and provided tech support. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Jewish Museum</small></p><p>A contributor to the show and its technical adviser, Ted Nelson recruited the RESISTORS to help him and some of the artists. As he later wrote in his influential 1974 book <a href=\"https://computerlibbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</em></em></a>, \u201cSome people are too proud to ask children for information. This is dumb. Information is where you find it.\u201d For Agnes Denes, a Hungarian-born conceptual artist, the teens coded a minicomputer to animate triangles on a screen for a piece called <em><em>Trigonal Ballet</em></em>. For conceptual artist Carl Fernbach-Flarsheim, the teens used the I Ching to program a piece called <em><em>Conceptual Typewriter.</em></em> A visitor could select one of several buttons, such as \u201cthe silent\u201d (represented by a circle) or \u201cthe providing\u201d (illustrated by sheaves of wheat), and then use a light pen to alter the image. Both artists provided the initial ideas, but the RESISTORS executed them.</p><p>Nelson, working with programmer Ned Woodman, contributed a piece titled <em><em>Labyrinth</em></em>. Running on a PDP-8 that DEC provided, <em><em>Labyrinth</em></em> was explained as \u201cthe first public demonstration of a hypertext system.\u201d To use it, a visitor would sit at a terminal and begin reading the displayed text. For the passage \u201cThe exhibition you are attending is called <em><em>Software</em></em>. It was organized by Jack Burnham,\u201d you could use keystrokes (such as <em><em>F</em></em> for <em><em>forward</em></em>) to navigate the text and retrieve a definition of \u201csoftware\u201d or biographical details about Burnham.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A black and white photo of four people posing in front of a computer terminal that displays a stack of triangles. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"24096\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-and-white-photo-of-four-people-posing-in-front-of-a-computer-terminal-that-displays-a-stack-of-triangles.jpg?id=62293611&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Conceptual artist Agnes Denes [right] programmed her piece <i>Trigonal Ballet</i> at the Jewish Museum with help from RESISTORS [from left] Peter Eichenberger, J Laurence Sarno, and John Levine.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Jewish Museum</small></p><p>For many museumgoers, the entire exhibition suggested a technological future where people easily navigated the information-rich realm of what would become known as cyberspace.</p><p>The RESISTORS, meanwhile, gradually faded throughout the 1970s as its members went off to college and the supply of new recruits dwindled. Nonetheless, members like Nat Kuhn and John Levine recall that ideas they bantered about in bull sessions with Nelson in Kagan\u2019s barn materialized later in the pages of <em><em>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</em></em>. \u201cThere was certainly very little in that book that we hadn\u2019t already heard about before it appeared,\u201d Levine said.</p><p>When I talked with former RESISTORS, it was surprising to hear how many members remained in touch with one another more than a half-century later. Many of them still included their participation on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Courtships formed, and at least two members married each other.
