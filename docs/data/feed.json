        "summary": "The extent to which women participate in the labor market varies greatly across the globe. If such differences reflect distortions that women face in accessing good jobs, they can reduce economic activity through a misallocation of talent. In this paper, we build on Hsieh et al. (2019) to provide a methodology to quantify these productivity consequences. The index we propose, the \u201dGlobal Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)\u201d, measures the losses in aggregate productivity that gender-based misallocation imposes. Our index allows us to separately identify labor demand distortions (e.g., discrimination in hiring for formal jobs) from labor supply distortions (e.g., frictions that discourage women\u2019s labor force participation) and can be computed using data on labor income and job types. Our methodology also highlights an important distinction between welfare-relevant misallocation and the consequences on aggregate GDP if misallocation arises between market work and non-market activities. To showcase the versatility of our index, we analyze gender misallocation within countries over time, across countries over the development spectrum, and across local labor markets within countries. We find that misallocation is substantial and that demand distortions account for most of the productivity losses."

        "summary": "As Ukraine emerges from the devastation of war, it faces a historic opportunity to engineer its own Wirtschaftswunder\u2014a productivity-driven economic transformation akin to post-war West Germany. While investment-led growth may offer quick wins, it is efficiency, innovation, and institutional reform that will determine Ukraine\u2019s long-term economic trajectory. Drawing on rich micro-level firm data spanning 25 years, this paper uncovers deep structural distortions that have suppressed creative destruction and productivity in Ukraine. It finds that business dynamism is on the decline, alongside rising market concentration among incumbent businesses, including low productivity state owned enterprises. To inform priorities for reviving business dynamism, this study develops a model of creative destruction drawing on Acemoglu et al. (2018) and Akcigit et al. (2021). The quantitative assessment highlights that policies that discipline entrenched incumbents are the bedrock for reviving business dynamism and engineer Ukraine\u2019s Wirtschaftswunder. Policies targeting specific types of firms have limited efficacy when incumbents run wild."

        "summary": "With higher education costs consistently outpacing inflation and public funding declining, college affordability has become a critical barrier to economic mobility for middle- and low-income families. While College Savings Accounts (CSAs), or 529 plans, offer tax-advantaged vehicles for college savings, their adoption patterns and educational impacts remain poorly understood. Using comprehensive administrative data from over 900,000 Illinois 529 accounts (2000-2023) linked to educational outcomes, plus complementary surveys of account owners and parents, we provide the first large-scale analysis of CSA participation and effectiveness. We find that while CSA adoption has expanded to every ZIP code in Illinois, participation remains concentrated among higher-income, more educated families. Financial literacy emerges as a key barrier: 61% of parents who could save enough to cover half of future college costs still perceive their potential savings as meaningless. Among participants, higher savings are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes, including four-year college enrollment, attendance at selective institutions, and the pursuit of post-graduate degrees. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing financial literacy gaps and misperceptions about modest savings could significantly expand CSA effectiveness as a tool for educational equity. Beyond state-level 529 program optimization, our findings suggest several promising avenues for federal policy coordination and institutional innovation."

        "summary": "We use a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model of international investment and production to investigate the real implications of the last five decades of financial globalization. We introduce a wedge accounting framework to estimate country- and time-varying measures of outward and inward Revealed Capital Account Openness (RKO). We show how to identify these wedges for a large panel of countries using limited publicly available data on national accounts and external asset and liability positions since the 1970s. Our analysis reveals striking cross-country differences in the pace and direction of financial account opening: wealthier countries have become relatively more open to foreign capital inflows, while poorer countries have become relatively more open to capital outflows, a phenomenon we call \u201cUnbalanced Financial Globalization.\u201d Counterfactual simulations show that this unbalanced financial globalization has worsened capital allocation, resulting in a 5.9% decrease in world GDP, a 3.4% rise in cross-country income inequality, lower wages in poorer countries, and a decline in rates of return on capital in richer countries. In contrast, if financial account opening had been uniform, the improved allocation of capital would have reduced income inequality, and increased global GDP. These findings underscore the crucial role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping the real impact of international capital markets integration."

The early stages of startup formation remain one of the least understood aspects of firm growth. The nature of this program and the data collected from its operations are well suited to investigate open questions in entrepreneurial strategy, entrepreneurial finance, advice, and technology transfer. This dataset combines three critical features for rigorous empirical research. First, the large, multi-year sample includes roughly 15,000 applicants, 9,000 founders in admitted startups, and nearly 2,000 mentors. Second, CDL recognized the academic value from the outset and built enterprise IT linking venture-level characteristics, structured longitudinal records of firm development and operations, and unstructured verbatim transcripts of mentor\u2013founder discussions. Third, the data cover 27 technological domains such as therapeutics and quantum computing. This paper provides an overview of the setting from which data is collected, a high-level description of available data, and information on how to access these data for research."

Reducing information frictions may make it easier for effective teachers to move to their preferred schools and increase cross-school inequality, but it may also attract high-quality entrants and improve market-level teacher quality. Taking these factors into account, we develop an equilibrium model of the teacher labor market and estimate it using data from the Houston Independent School District, which launched a transparent teacher evaluation system in 2011. Counterfactual simulations reveal that (1) making district teachers\u2019 quality observable to all district schools improves average teacher quality at the district level and in the top and bottom quartiles of schools ranked by student performance, while decreasing it in other schools; (2) budget-neutral bonus programs that incentivize high-quality teachers to teach in low-performing schools can increase overall teacher quality and reduce cross-school inequalities; and (3) these programs are more effective in markets with cross-employer information symmetry."

        "summary": "We estimate the impacts of large-scale unconditional cash transfers on child survival. One-time transfers of USD 1000 were provided to over 10,500 poor households across 653 randomized villages in Kenya. We collected census data on over 100,000 births, including on mortality and cause of death, and detailed data on household health behaviors. Unconditional cash transfers (accounting for spillovers) lead to 48% fewer infant deaths before age one and 45% fewer child deaths before age five. Detailed data on cause of death, transfer timing relative to birth, and the location of health facilities indicate that unconditional cash transfers and access to delivery care are complements in generating mortality reductions: the largest gains are estimated in neonatal and maternal causes of death largely preventable by appropriate obstetric care and among households living close to physician-staffed facilities and those who receive the transfer around the time of birth, and treatment leads to a large increase in hospital deliveries (by 45%). The infant and child mortality declines are concentrated among poorer households with below median assets or predicted consumption. The transfers also result in a substantial decline of 51% in female labor supply in the three months before and the three months after a birth, and improved child nutrition. Infant and child mortality largely revert to pre-program levels after cash transfers end. Despite not being the main aim of the original program, we show that unconditional cash transfers in this setting may be a cost-effective way to reduce infant and child deaths."

His earliest memories are of welding with his grandfather and knitting with his grandmother\u2014unusual hobbies for a typical 4-year-old, though not in Mann\u2019s family. His father, who worked for a men\u2019s clothing company, supplemented his income by buying and renovating houses, long before the concept of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/house-flip.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flipping houses</a> became widespread.</p><p>\u201cWe were always living in a house under construction,\u201d Mann recalls. \u201cI used to help my dad fix things when I was 4 or 5\u2014hammer in my hand\u2014normal stuff.\u201d His grandfather, a refrigeration engineer, taught him how to weld. By age 6, he was wiring and building homemade radios. By the time he was 8, he had started a neighborhood repair business, fixing televisions and radios.</p><p>\u201cIn a sense, preschool for me was learning engineering and science,\u201d Mann says with a laugh. \u201cI grew up putting together wood, metal, or fabric. I knew how to make things at a very young age.\u201d</p><h2>Learning to see what others miss</h2><p>When Mann was 12 years old, his father brought home a broken oscillograph (an early version of the oscilloscope, used to display variations in voltage or current as visual waveforms). It turned out to be a defining moment in his life. Too impatient to accept that the waveform dot on the machine\u2019s display moved only up and down instead of both vertically and horizontally, Mann invented a way to push its image through physical space.</p><p>He placed the oscillograph\u2014which he now keeps on a shelf in his laboratory\u2014on a board mounted on roller skate wheels. He connected the device to a police radar and rolled it back and forth. When he realized the machine\u2019s motion, combined with the dot\u2019s vertical movement, created visible waveforms of the radar\u2019s signals, as a function of space rather than time, he unknowingly made a revolutionary discovery.</p><p>Later he would describe that merging of physical and virtual worlds as \u201cextended reality\u201d\u2014a concept that underlies today\u2019s<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-alliance-advancing-augmented-reality\" target=\"_self\"> AR</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/extended-reality\" target=\"_self\">XR</a> technologies. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time Mann\u2019s curiosity turned a problem into an opportunity.</p><p>Decades later, on the main floor of his Toronto home, he co-founded <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/pages/team\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InteraXon</a>, the Toronto-based company behind the <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqc3ta8hB6lNjQIi_jbX_Go5LphTzvrPTwE1tsykr5bg8XsWn-I\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muse brain-sensing headband</a>, used to help people manage sleep, stress, and mental health.</p><p>Mann shares legendary 1970s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/26/business/silicon-valley-tech-xerox-parc-sri.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xerox PARC</a> researcher <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kay_3972189.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kay</a>\u2019s belief that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2017/04/04/7-steps-for-inventing-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The best way to predict the future is to invent it</a>.\u201d Mann, however, adds: \u201cSometimes you invent it by simply refusing to accept the limitations of the present.\u201d</p><h2>A member of MIT\u2019s Media Lab</h2><p> In high school, Mann won several math competitions designed to challenge students at university level. In 1982 he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.mcmaster.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McMaster University</a>, in Hamilton, Ontario, to pursue a degree in engineering physics (an interdisciplinary program that combines physics, mathematics, and engineering principles). As an undergraduate, Mann was already experimenting with early prototypes of wearable computers\u2014head-mounted displays, body-worn cameras, and portable computing systems that predated mainstream mobile tech by decades.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rehmi Post, Thad Starner, Steve Mann and Professor Alex Pentland donning wearable computers that resemble electronic eyeglasses in the 1990s.

He continued his studies at McMaster to earn a second bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1989, then a master\u2019s degree in engineering in 1991.</p><p>He then enrolled in a doctoral program at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>, where he joined its renowned <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Media Lab</a>, a hotbed for unconventional research blending technology, design, and the human experience. He formalized and expanded his ideas around wearable computing, wearable computer vision systems, and wearable AI. He also published some of the earliest academic papers that described the concept of sousveillance.</p><p>He completed his Ph.D. in media arts and sciences in 1997.</p><p>Mann\u2019s doctoral research contributed foundational concepts and hardware that influenced future smart glasses and devices for life logging, the practice of creating a digital record of one\u2019s daily life.

He says he is equally as fascinated by how technology interacts with the natural world as he is by how to remove barriers between the physical world and virtual world.</p><p><span>His interests connect to what he calls \u201cvironmentalism,\u201d which regards technology as a boundary between our environment and our \u201cvironment\u201d (ourselves). This gives rise to his vision of \u201cmersive\u201d technologies that link humans not just to each other but also to the environment around them.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span></span>\u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school.

He credits the organization with connecting him to pioneers like <a href=\"https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/news/simon-haykin-receives-ieee-medal-for-advancing-radar-technologies/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Haykin</a>, the radar visionary he met at McMaster while he was in high school.

He has served as an organizer, session chair, and program committee member for IEEE conferences related to wearable computing and pervasive sensing.</p><p>In 1997 he helped found the<a href=\"https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2024/iswc-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Symposium on Wearable Computers</a>, and numerous other wearable computing symposia, conferences, and events.</p><p>He has given keynote talks and presented papers on topics including sousveillance, ubiquitous computing, and other humanistic aspects of technology at the <a href=\"https://attend.ieee.org/istas-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://percom.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications</a>.</p><p>His contributions include influential papers in IEEE journals, especially various IEEE Transactions and Computer Society magazines.</p><p>Probably his most well-known paper is \u201c<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/566147\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wearable Computing</a>.\u201d Published in <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=PER300-PRT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Computer</em></em></a> magazine in October 1997, the seminal work outlined the structure and vision for wearable computing as a formal research field.

He\u2019s still driven, he says, by the same forces that powered his backyard experiments as a child: curiosity and passion.</p><p>For students who hope to follow in his footsteps, Mann\u2019s advice is simple: \u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school. Don\u2019t define yourself by the classes you took or the jobs you had. Define yourself by what you love so much you\u2019d do it \u201ceven if no teachers or managers were demanding it\u201d. He adds that, \u201cAI can replace a walking encyclopedia. It can\u2019t replace passion.\u201d</p><p>Mann says he has no plans to retire. If anything, he says, his most productive years are yet to come.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m a late bloomer,\u201d he says, chuckling at the irony. \u201cI was fixing radios when I was 8, but my best work?

This was the \u201coveremployed\u201d craze, and the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/\" target=\"_blank\">/r/overemployed</a> subreddit ballooned to nearly half a million members. The dream was to earn double the income, accelerate the path to financial freedom, and subtly defy corporate America.</span></p><p>As we\u2019ve come back to physical offices, overemployment has become less common, but I was shocked when an engineer recently told me he was working two full-time jobs. He was enjoying the extra pay, but he was also stressed out about keeping secrets from both his managers. Beyond the anxiety of juggling two jobs, overemployment is clearly a career-limiting move for engineers.</p><p>Beyond the obvious contractual breaches\u2014most full-time employment agreements explicitly forbid this kind of moonlighting without consent\u2014overemployment is simply a bad idea.</p><p>With overemployment, you\u2019re essentially trying to \u201cget by\u201d in two roles. Instead of building strong relationships and genuinely contributing, you must perform a delicate balancing act, hoping neither employer catches on. This is incredibly short-sighted. Your career growth isn\u2019t about accumulating company logos; it\u2019s about the skills you acquire, the impact you make, and the people who can advocate for you. You\u2019ll grow exponentially faster\u2014and frankly, have a lot more fun\u2014 if you commit fully to one role.</p><p>The temporary financial bump of overemployment comes at a steep price; your coworkers will likely stop trusting you. This concern increases as you become more senior. At the Staff or Principal Engineer level, your <span>job</span> will depend on the relationships you\u2019ve built and your ability to work with (and through) other people. Overemployment, especially when it\u2019s a covert operation, is a fundamental violation of trust. How can you provide meaningful mentorship or truly collaborate when you\u2019re hiding a massive part of your professional life? I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible.</p><p>The ultimate career hack is quite simple: commit fully to a <span>job</span> where you\u2019re surrounded by smart coworkers in a company that\u2019s growing rapidly. This is far less complicated (and more ethical) than overemployment. This advice applies equally to engineers who believe they can do multiple personal projects alongside their full-time <span>job</span>.</p><p>The compounding effect of real skill development, strong professional relationships, and single-threaded focus will provide significantly better returns than any short-term double-dipping scheme.

This will change many things about what\u2019s often described as the \u201cCIA triad\u201d of digital security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Of those three features, data integrity will become of paramount importance.</p><h3>Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Blue rocket launching near a tower with an explosive burst overhead.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8b9a4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blue-rocket-launching-near-a-tower-with-an-explosive-burst-overhead.png?id=61453398&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A 64-bit velocity calculation was converted to</span> a 16-bit output, causing an error called overflow. The corrupted data triggered catastrophic course corrections that forced the US $370 million rocket to self-destruct.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>When we have agency in digital spaces, we naturally maintain their integrity\u2014protecting them from deterioration and shaping them with intention. But in territories controlled by distant platforms, where we\u2019re merely temporary visitors, that connection frays. A disconnect emerges between those who benefit from data and those who bear the consequences of compromised integrity. Like homeowners who care deeply about maintaining the property they own, users in the Web 3.0 paradigm will become stewards of their personal digital spaces.</p><p>This will be critical in a world where <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-agents\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> don\u2019t just answer our questions but act on our behalf. These agents may execute financial transactions, coordinate complex workflows, and autonomously operate critical infrastructure, making decisions that ripple through entire industries. As digital agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the question is no longer whether we will trust AI but what that trust is built upon. In the new age we\u2019re entering, the foundation isn\u2019t intelligence or efficiency\u2014it\u2019s integrity.</p><h2>What Is Data Integrity?</h2><p>In information systems, integrity is the guarantee that data will not be modified without authorization, and that all transformations are verifiable throughout the data\u2019s life cycle. While availability ensures that systems are running and confidentiality prevents unauthorized access, integrity focuses on whether information is accurate, unaltered, and consistent across systems and over time.</p><h3>NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract satellite orbiting orange planet on a dark blue background with scattered dots.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"016f0\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-satellite-orbiting-orange-planet-on-a-dark-blue-background-with-scattered-dots.png?id=61453435&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br />Lockheed Martin\u2019s software calculated thrust in pound-seconds, while NASA\u2019s navigation software expected newton-seconds. The failure caused the $328 million spacecraft to burn up in the Mars atmosphere.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It\u2019s a new idea. The undo button, which prevents accidental data loss, is an integrity feature. So is the reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state. Checksums are an integrity feature; so are verifications of network transmission.</p><p>Without integrity, security measures can backfire. Encrypting corrupted data just locks in errors. Systems that score high marks for availability but spread misinformation just become amplifiers of risk.</p><p>All IT systems require some form of data integrity, but the need for it is especially pronounced in two areas today. First: Internet of Things devices interact directly with the physical world, so corrupted input or output can result in real-world harm. Second: AI systems are only as good as the integrity of the data they\u2019re trained on, and the integrity of their decision-making processes. If that foundation is shaky, the results will be too.</p><p>Integrity manifests in four key areas. The first, <em>input integrity,</em> concerns the quality and authenticity of data entering a system. When this fails, consequences can be severe. In 2021, <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook\u2019s global outage</a> was triggered by a single mistaken command\u2014an input error missed by automated systems. Protecting input integrity requires robust authentication of data sources, cryptographic signing of sensor data, and diversity in input channels for cross-validation.</p><p>The second issue is <em>processing integrity,</em> which ensures that systems transform inputs into outputs correctly. In 2003, the <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Documents/August_2003_Blackout_Final_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.\u2013Canada blackout</a> affected 55 million people when a control-room process failed to refresh properly, resulting in damages exceeding US $6 billion. Safeguarding processing integrity means formally verifying algorithms, cryptographically protecting models, and monitoring systems for anomalous behavior.</p><h3>Microsoft\u2019s Tay Chatbot (2016)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract robot illustration with orange eyes, yellow face, blue-black mouth and beige background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fca2a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-robot-illustration-with-orange-eyes-yellow-face-blue-black-mouth-and-beige-background.png?id=61454030&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Released on Twitter, Microsoft</span>\u2019s AI chatbot was vulnerable to a \u201crepeat after me\u201d command, which meant it would echo any offensive content fed to it.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><em>Storage integrity</em> covers the correctness of information as it\u2019s stored and communicated. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration was <a href=\"https://www.thestack.technology/faa-outage-cause-notam-database-file-not-cyber/\" target=\"_blank\">forced to halt</a> all U.S. departing flights because of a corrupted database file. Addressing this risk requires cryptographic approaches that make any modification computationally infeasible without detection, distributed storage systems to prevent single points of failure, and rigorous backup procedures.</p><p>Finally, <em>contextual integrity</em> addresses the appropriate flow of information according to the norms of its larger context. It\u2019s not enough for data to be accurate; it must also be used in ways that respect expectations and boundaries. For example, if a smart speaker listens in on casual family conversations and uses the data to build advertising profiles, that action would violate the expected boundaries of data collection. Preserving contextual integrity requires clear data-governance policies, principles that limit the use of data to its intended purposes, and mechanisms for enforcing information-flow constraints.</p><p>As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions with reduced human oversight, all these dimensions of integrity become critical.</p><h2>The Need for Integrity in Web 3.0</h2><p>As the digital landscape has shifted from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and now evolves toward Web 3.0, we\u2019ve seen each era bring a different emphasis in the <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad\" target=\"_blank\">CIA triad</a> of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><h3>Boeing 737 MAX (2018)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Cartoon airplane crashes into water; orange 'X' symbol above indicates failure.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8f82b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/cartoon-airplane-crashes-into-water-orange-x-symbol-above-indicates-failure.png?id=61454071&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Input integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Faulty sensor data caused a</span>n automated flight-control system to repeatedly push the airplane\u2019s nose down, leading to a fatal crash.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Returning to our home metaphor: When simply having shelter is what matters most, availability takes priority\u2014the house must exist and be functional. Once that foundation is secure, confidentiality becomes important\u2014you need locks on your doors to keep others out. Only after these basics are established do you begin to consider integrity, to ensure that what\u2019s inside the house remains trustworthy, unaltered, and consistent over time.</p><p>Web 1.0 of the 1990s prioritized making information available. Organizations digitized their content, putting it out there for anyone to access. In Web 2.0, the Web of today, platforms for e-commerce, social media, and cloud computing prioritize confidentiality, as personal data has become the Internet\u2019s currency.</p><p>Somehow, integrity was largely lost along the way. In our current Web architecture, where control is centralized and removed from individual users, the concern for integrity has diminished. The massive social media platforms have created environments where no one feels responsible for the truthfulness or quality of what circulates.</p><h3>SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack (2020)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Capitol building with skull emblem and coding patterns, symbolizing cybersecurity threats.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e236\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/capitol-building-with-skull-emblem-and-coding-patterns-symbolizing-cybersecurity-threats.png?id=61454168&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Russian hackers compromised </span>the process that SolarWinds used to package its software, injecting malicious code that was distributed to 18,000 customers, including nine federal agencies. The hack remained undetected for 14 months.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Web 3.0 is poised to change this dynamic by returning ownership to the data owners. This is not speculative; it\u2019s already emerging. For example, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol behind decentralized social networks like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, combines content sharing with built-in attribution. Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solid protocol</a> restructures the Web around personal data pods with granular access controls.</p><p>These technologies prioritize integrity through cryptographic verification that proves authorship, decentralized architectures that eliminate vulnerable central authorities, machine-readable semantics that make meaning explicit\u2014structured data formats that allow computers to understand participants and actions, such as \u201cAlice performed surgery on Bob\u201d\u2014and transparent governance where rules are visible to all. As AI systems become more autonomous, communicating directly with one another via standardized protocols, these integrity controls will be essential for maintaining trust.</p><h2>Why Data Integrity Matters in AI</h2><p>For AI systems, integrity is crucial in four domains. The first is decision quality. With AI increasingly contributing to decision-making in health care, justice, and finance, the integrity of both data and models\u2019 actions directly impact human welfare. Accountability is the second domain. Understanding the causes of failures requires reliable logging, audit trails, and system records.</p><h3>ChatGPT Data Leak (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Unlocked orange padlock with phone displaying keyhole; purple background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b856\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/unlocked-orange-padlock-with-phone-displaying-keyhole-purple-background.png?id=61454212&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A bug in </span>OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT mixed different users\u2019 conversation histories. Users suddenly had other people\u2019s chats appear in their interfaces with no way to prove the conversations weren\u2019t theirs.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The third domain is the security relationships between components. Many authentication systems rely on the integrity of identity information and cryptographic keys. If these elements are compromised, malicious agents could impersonate trusted systems, potentially creating cascading failures as AI agents interact and make decisions based on corrupted credentials.</p><p>Finally, integrity matters in our public definitions of safety. Governments worldwide are introducing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\" target=\"_self\">rules for AI</a> that focus on data accuracy, transparent algorithms, and verifiable claims about system behavior. Integrity provides the basis for meeting these legal obligations.</p><p>The importance of integrity only grows as AI systems are entrusted with more critical applications and operate with less human oversight. While people can sometimes detect integrity lapses, autonomous systems may not only miss warning signs\u2014they may exponentially increase the severity of breaches. Without assurances of integrity, organizations will not trust AI systems for important tasks, and we won\u2019t realize the full potential of AI.</p><h2>How to Build AI Systems With Integrity</h2><p>Imagine an AI system as a home we\u2019re building together. The integrity of this home doesn\u2019t rest on a single security feature but on the thoughtful integration of many elements: solid foundations, well-constructed walls, clear pathways between rooms, and shared agreements about how spaces will be used.</p><h3>Midjourney Bias (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract digital screen with colorful user icons and communication symbols.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"59897\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-digital-screen-with-colorful-user-icons-and-communication-symbols.png?id=61454522&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Contextual integrity failure</strong> <br />Users discovered that the AI image generator often produced biased images of people, such as showing white men as CEOs regardless of the prompt. The AI tool didn\u2019t accurately reflect the context requested by the users.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We begin by laying the cornerstone: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\" target=\"_self\">cryptographic verification</a>. Digital signatures ensure that data lineage is traceable, much like a title deed proves ownership. Decentralized identifiers act as digital passports, allowing components to prove identity independently. When the front door of our AI home recognizes visitors through their own keys rather than through a vulnerable central doorman, we create resilience in the architecture of trust.</p><p>Formal verification methods enable us to mathematically prove the structural integrity of critical components, ensuring that systems can withstand pressures placed upon them\u2014especially in high-stakes domains where lives may depend on an AI\u2019s decision.</p><p>Just as a well-designed home creates separate spaces, trustworthy AI systems are built with thoughtful compartmentalization. We don\u2019t rely on a single barrier but rather layer them to limit how problems in one area might affect others. Just as a kitchen fire is contained by fire doors and independent smoke alarms, training data is separated from the AI\u2019s inferences and output to limit the impact of any single failure or breach.</p><p>Throughout this AI home, we build transparency into the design: The equivalent of large windows that allow light into every corner is clear pathways from input to output. We install monitoring systems that continuously check for weaknesses, alerting us before small issues become catastrophic failures.</p><h3>Prompt Injection Attacks (2023\u20132024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Stylized blue bug on screen with keyboard; sad face in orange circle connected by line.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c6e75\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/stylized-blue-bug-on-screen-with-keyboard-sad-face-in-orange-circle-connected-by-line.png?id=61454587&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input integrity failure</strong> <br />Attackers embedded hidden prompts in emails, documents, and websites that hijacked AI assistants, causing them to treat malicious instructions as legitimate commands.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>But a home isn\u2019t just a physical structure, it\u2019s also the agreements we make about how to live within it. Our governance frameworks act as these shared understandings. Before welcoming new residents, we provide them with certification standards. Just as landlords conduct credit checks, we conduct integrity assessments to evaluate newcomers. And we strive to be good neighbors, aligning our community agreements with broader societal expectations.</p><p>Perhaps most important, we recognize that our AI home will shelter diverse individuals with varying needs. Our governance structures must reflect this diversity, bringing many stakeholders to the table. A truly trustworthy system cannot be designed only for its builders but must serve anyone authorized to eventually call it home.</p><p>That\u2019s how we\u2019ll create AI systems worthy of trust: not by blindly believing in their perfection but because we\u2019ve intentionally designed them with integrity controls at every level.</p><h2>A Challenge of Language</h2><p>Unlike other properties of security, like \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cprivate,\u201d we don\u2019t have a common adjective form for \u201cintegrity.\u201d This makes it hard to talk about it. It turns out that there is a word in English: \u201cintegrous.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recorded the word used in the mid-1600s but now <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/integrous_adj?tab=factsheet&amp;tl=true#210671\" target=\"_blank\">declares it obsolete</a>.</p><h3>CrowdStrike\u00a0Outage (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Three panels: people on escalator, government building, hospital with red cross flag.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"031f4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-panels-people-on-escalator-government-building-hospital-with-red-cross-flag.png?id=61454608&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Processing integrity failure</strong><br />A faulty software update from CrowdStrike caused 8.5 million Windows computers worldwide to crash\u2014grounding flights, shutting down hospitals, and disrupting banks.

The update, which contained a software logic error, hadn\u2019t gone through full testing protocols.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We believe that the word needs to be revived. We need the ability to describe a system with integrity. We must be able to talk about integrous systems design.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><p>Ensuring integrity in AI presents formidable challenges. As models grow larger and more complex, maintaining integrity without sacrificing performance becomes difficult. Integrity controls often require computational resources that can slow systems down\u2014particularly challenging for real-time applications. Another concern is that emerging technologies like quantum computing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2668949802\" target=\"_self\">threaten current cryptographic protections</a>. Additionally, the distributed nature of modern AI\u2014which relies on vast ecosystems of libraries, frameworks, and services\u2014presents a large attack surface.</p><p>Beyond technology, integrity depends heavily on social factors. Companies often prioritize speed to market over robust integrity controls. Development teams may lack specialized knowledge for implementing these controls, and may find it particularly difficult to integrate them into legacy systems. And while some governments have begun establishing regulations for aspects of AI, we need worldwide alignment on governance for AI integrity.</p><h3>Voice-Clone Scams (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"People holding phones, speech bubble showing happiness, money, and skull emoji.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"26ea5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/people-holding-phones-speech-bubble-showing-happiness-money-and-skull-emoji.png?id=61454716&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input and processing integrity failure</strong><br />Scammers used AI-powered voice-cloning tools to mimic the voices of victims\u2019 family members, tricking people into sending money. These scams succeeded because neither phone systems nor victims identified the AI-generated voice as fake.<br /></p><p><span>Addressing these challenges requires sustained research into verifying and enforcing integrity, as well as recovering from breaches. Priority areas include fault-tolerant algorithms for distributed learning, verifiable computation on encrypted data, techniques that maintain integrity despite adversarial attacks, and standardized metrics for certification. We also need interfaces that clearly communicate integrity status to human overseers.</span></p><p>As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the stakes for integrity have never been higher. We are entering an era where machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous agents will operate with reduced human oversight and make decisions with profound impacts.</p><p>The good news is that the tools for building systems with integrity already exist. What\u2019s needed is a shift in mind-set: from treating integrity as an afterthought to accepting that it\u2019s the core organizing principle of AI security.</p><p>The next era of technology will be defined not by what AI can do, but by whether we can trust it to know or especially to do what\u2019s right. Integrity\u2014in all its dimensions\u2014will determine the answer. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

These include \u201cpiggyback missions\u201d where CREAM will ride aboard other spacecraft as a digital payload, plus a dedicated demonstration mission to test the system\u2019s capabilities in the harsh environment of space.</p><p>Beyond preventing immediate collisions, CREAM addresses a fundamental challenge in space governance. Establishing \u201crules of the road\u201d for space traffic has always faced a chicken and egg problem; you need both international agreement on the rules and the technology to enforce them.</p><p>CREAM provides that missing technological foundation. The system offers standardized tools that help operators follow best practices while giving regulators ways to monitor compliance. Its flexible design allows nontechnical users to update standards and rules as international norms evolve. This adaptability ensures CREAM will remain relevant as space technology advances and new challenges emerge. Rather than becoming obsolete, the system can grow and adapt alongside our expanding presence in space.</p>"

In a world where technology is increasingly integrated into every aspect of our lives\u2014from industrial robots to autonomous vehicles\u2014the potential for harm from product malfunctions makes functional safety not just important, but critical. </span></p><p>This webinar cuts through the complexity to provide a clear understanding of what functional safety truly entails and why it\u2019s critical for product success. We\u2019ll start by defining functional safety not by its often-confusing official terms, but as a structured methodology for managing risk through defined engineering processes, essential product design requirements, and probabilistic analysis. The \u201cnorth star\u201d goals? To ensure your <span>product not only works reliably but, if it does fail, it does so in a safe and predictable manner.</span></p><p>We\u2019ll dive into two fundamental concepts: the <span>Safety Lifecycle, a detailed engineering process focused on design quality to minimize systematic failures, and Probabilistic, Performance-Based Design using reliability metrics to minimize random hardware failures. You\u2019ll learn about IEC 61508, the foundational standard for functional safety, and how numerous industry-specific standards derive from it.</span></p><p>The webinar will walk you through the Engineering Design phases: analyzing hazards and required <span>risk reduction, realizing optimal designs, and ensuring safe operation. We\u2019ll demystify the Performance Concept and the critical Safety Integrity Level (SIL), explaining its definition, criteria (systematic capability, architectural constraints, PFD), and how it relates to industry-specific priorities.</span></p><p>Discover key Design Verification techniques like DFMEA/DDMA and FMEDA, emphasizing how these tools help identify and address problems early in development. We\u2019ll detail the <span>FMEDA technique showing how design decisions directly impact predictions like safe and dangerous failure rates, diagnostic coverage, and useful life. Finally, we\u2019ll cover Functional Safety Certification, explaining its purpose, process, and what adjustments to your development process can set you up for success.</span></p><p><span><span><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/749990?utm_source=Wiley&amp;utm_medium=Spectrum\" target=\"_blank\">Register now for this free webinar!</a></span></span></p>"

As a youngster growing up in Chennai, India, Pandy loved acting and dancing, but he also excelled in math and science in school.</p><p>His parents, both educators, supported their son\u2019s passion but encouraged him to consider studying engineering. They told him that if engineering didn\u2019t work out, he could always try show business.</p><h3>Gokul Pandy</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Accenture in Richmond, Va.</p><p><strong>Title: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Application development manager</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Senior member</p><p><strong>Alma maters: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Anand Institute of Higher Technology, Chennai, India; Alagappa University, in Karaikudi, India</p><h3></h3><br /><p>He took their advice and, as a high school student, began watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> videos of engineers solving real-world problems. Those videos inspired him to enroll in the engineering program at <a href=\"https://aiht.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Anand Institute of Higher Technology</a>, in Chennai. During his second year there, a career in engineering won out over one in entertainment. His engineering career has had its challenges, however.</p><p>Today, Pandy is an application development manager at <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a>, in Richmond, Va. The IEEE senior member also serves as the chair of the <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Richmond Section</a>.</p><p>He was inducted this month into the <a href=\"https://hkn.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE\u2013Eta Kappa Nu</a> honor society.</p><h2>From IT support to robotic automation expert</h2><p>Pandy graduated from Anand in 2008 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communications engineering. It was at the height of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Great Recession</a>, which began in 2007 and ended in 2009. Many countries, including India, had high unemployment rates then, making it tougher to find a full-time job. To boost his chances, Pandy earned a variety of certifications including <a href=\"https://academy.pega.com/mission/lead-system-architect/v2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lead system architect</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AWS cloud partitioner</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">robotic process automation</a> (RPA). He also enrolled in the online MBA program at <a href=\"https://www.alagappauniversity.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alagappa University</a>, in Karaikudi, India\u2014which he completed in 2011.</p><p>In 2008 he was hired by <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a> in Bangalore as a contract employee, working in IT support. Thanks to his consistent hard work, he says, the company promoted him to full-time software engineer, which was \u201clife-changing.\u201d</p><p>He was transferred to the company\u2019s Chennai office and eventually was promoted to senior software engineer.</p><p>He became an expert on automation frameworks: structured sets of guidelines, tools, and practices designed to streamline and manage repetitive tasks.</p><p>To address inefficiencies in systems, he and his team designed and led an open-source automation tool that automates processes such as data entry and validation, and it verifies compliance across multiple levels.</p><p>By automating repetitive administrative tasks, business users could focus on other important duties.</p><p>In 2015 his company moved Pandy to the United States to support a major health care transformation initiative.</p><p>\u201cThat move marked a turning point in my career,\u201d he says, \u201cpropelling me into the international spotlight as a thought leader in enterprise automation.\u201d He became an automation subject matter expert from a manual tester for two major health care organizations, he says.</p><p>His efforts have been recognized.

Today\u2019s young adults want everything instantly\u2014which isn\u2019t realistic in the workplace. </li><li>Keep learning. Today\u2019s technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are evolving quickly, and you need to stay on top of the latest innovations. </li><li>Don\u2019t wait for the perfect opportunity; rather, create it. </li><li>Don\u2019t view yourself as \u201cjust\u201d a software engineer or \u201cjust\u201d an associate engineer. Go the extra mile, even if you aren\u2019t paid to do so. That way, you\u2019ll always be one step ahead of the competition. </li><li>Build solutions that will have a real-world impact, not just theoretical value. Theoretical value is good to study, but make the application practical. When you do practical work, you\u2019ll come to know the difficulties, the failures, and the pros and cons.</li><li>Staying true to yourself will help you grow in your career.</li><li>Stay humble, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they are silly.</li><li>Get involved in a professional organization, such as IEEE, early in your career. You\u2019ll get to know about cutting-edge technologies, meet great leaders, and pick up skills that will help your career.</li></ul><p><span>\u201cIEEE stays updated on the frontier of technologies and gives back to the engineering community,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt also provides services to students and initiates talks where we can explore topics with respect to our skills and knowledge, and mentor others.\u201d</span></p><p>Interested in volunteering and mentoring, he decided to nominate himself for the position of IEEE Richmond Section chair. The section has more than 800 members and covers six cities and 26 counties.</p><p>Being chair is his first volunteer leadership position. He says he believed that running the section would enhance his leadership skills. Winning the election \u201cwas a miracle,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was another enrichment opportunity for my career.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/about/excom-2/\" target=\"_blank\">He began his term in January</a> and was initially anxious about the additional workload, he says, but so far his term has been an \u201camazing experience.\u201d He credits IEEE Senior Member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenjjones/\" target=\"_blank\">Allen Jones</a>, a past chair of the section, for helping him through the transition.</p><p>Pandy has been busy since taking office. The section formed a <a href=\"https://life.ieee.org/volunteers/life-members-affinity-groups/\" target=\"_blank\">life members affinity group</a> and has held events with the <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/vcu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Virginia Commonwealth University student branch</a> in Richmond. The section also held <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/leadership-skills-ieee-courses\" target=\"_blank\">career-development</a> events there, allowing IEEE members to mentor engineering students, provide them with networking tips, and help them refine their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://ieeemagnetics.org/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Magnetics Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society</a> chapters partnered with VCU, <a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI Ready RVA</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ritsva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Richmond Institute of Technology and Science</a> to increase<a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> artificial intelligence literacy for preuniversity students in underserved communities</a>. The initiative provides training to educators and offers workshops to students demonstrating the technology and its practical applications.</p><p>Through leading all those activities, Pandy says, he has picked up important skills including strategic planning, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5-tips-technical-presentations\" target=\"_blank\">public speaking</a>, team collaboration, and budget planning, which he can apply at work.</p><p>\u201cThese experiences have helped me drive large-scale IT transformation projects in my professional role,\u201d he says, \u201cand improved my ability to lead diverse and cross-functional teams.</p><p>\u201cVolunteering fuels my energy rather than drains it. Also, it\u2019s kind of a small, rewarding part of my weekly routine. I feel that I\u2019ve done a little bit to help someone somewhere move a step ahead in their career\u2014which gives me great satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Pandy hasn\u2019t lost his desire to be an entertainer. He performs whenever possible at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeZ2sFI74Do\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cultural events</a> and the section\u2019s social gatherings.</p><p>\u201cDancing and acting are now hobbies,\u201d he says.</p>"

The standard was a result of a <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 memorandum</a> from the Biden administration that requires federal agencies to transition to PQC-based security by 2035.</p><p>Cryptography relies on math problems that are nearly impossible to solve, but easy to check if a solution is correct. Armed with such math problems, only the holder of a secret key can check their solution and get access to the secret data. Today, most online cryptography relies on one of two such algorithms: either <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rsa-token-replacement-a-slow-process\" target=\"_blank\">RSA</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography\" target=\"_blank\">elliptic curve cryptography</a>.</p><p>The cause for concern is that quantum computers, if a large enough one is ever built, would make easy work of the \u201chard\u201d problems underlying current cryptographic methods. Luckily, there are other math problems that appear to be equally hard for quantum computers and their existing classical counterparts. That\u2019s the basis of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2667758178\" target=\"_blank\">post-quantum cryptography</a>: cryptography that\u2019s secure against hypothetical quantum computers.</p><p>With the mathematics behind PQC ironed out, and standards in hand, the work of adoption is now underway. This is no easy feat: every computer, laptop, smartphone, self-driving car, or IoT device will have to fundamentally change the way they run cryptography.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ali.elkaafarani\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ali El Kaafarani</a> is a research fellow at the Oxford Mathematical Institute who contributed to the development of NIST\u2019s PQC standards. He also founded a company, <a href=\"https://pqshield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PQShield</a>, to help bring post-quantum cryptography into the real world by assisting original equipment manufacturers in implementing the new protocols. He spoke with <em>IEEE Spectrum <strong></strong><strong></strong></em><span>about</span> how adoption is going and whether the new standards will be implemented in time to beat the looming threat of quantum computers.</p><p><strong>What has changed in the industry since the NIST PQC standards came out?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait photograph of Ali El Kaafarani, dark haired man with a beard, a mustache and glasses\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"65f9b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-photograph-of-ali-el-kaafarani-dark-haired-man-with-a-beard-a-mustache-and-glasses.jpg?id=61455658&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ali El Kaafarani</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">PQShield</small></p><p><strong>Ali El Kaafarani</strong>: Before the standards came out, a lot of people were not talking about it at all, in the spirit of \u201cIf it\u2019s working, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d Once the standards were published, the whole story changed, because now it\u2019s not hypothetical quantum hype, it\u2019s a compliance issue. There are standards published by the U.S. government. There are deadlines for the adoption. And the 2035 [deadline] came together with the publication from [the National Security Agency], and was adopted in formal legislation that passed Congress and therefore there is no way around it. Now it\u2019s a compliance issue.</p><p>Before, people used to ask us, \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer. But that\u2019s the issue, because we\u2019re talking about a risk that can materialize any time. Some other, more intelligent people who have access to a wider range of information decided in 2015 to categorize quantum computing as a real threat. So this year was a transformational year, because the question went from \u201cWhy do we need it?\u201d to \u201cHow are we going to use it?\u201d And the whole supply chain started looking into who\u2019s going to do what, from chip design to the network security layer, to the critical national infrastructure, to build up a post-quantum-enabled network security kit.</p><h2>Challenges in PQC Implementation</h2><p><strong>What are some of the difficulties of implementing the NIST standards?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> You have the beautiful math, you have the algorithms from NIST, but you also have the wild west of cybersecurity. That infrastructure goes from the smallest sensors and car keys, etc., to the largest server sitting there and trying to crunch hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, each with different security requirements, each with different energy consumption requirements. Now that is a different problem. That\u2019s not a mathematical problem, that\u2019s an implementation problem. This is where you need a company like PQShield, where we gather hardware engineers, and firmware engineers, and software engineers, and mathematicians, and everyone else around them to actually say, \u201cWhat can we do with this particular use case?\u201d</p><p>Cryptography is the backbone of cybersecurity infrastructure, and worse than that, it\u2019s the invisible piece that nobody cares about until it breaks. If it\u2019s working, nobody touches it. They only talk about it when there\u2019s a breach, and then they try to fix things. In the end, they usually put bandaids on it. That\u2019s normal, because enterprises can\u2019t sell the security feature to the customers. They were just using it when governments force them, like when there\u2019s a compliance issue. And now it\u2019s a much bigger problem, as someone is telling them, \u201cYou know what, all the cryptography that you\u2019ve been using for the past 15 years, 20 years, you need to change it, actually.\u201d</p><p><strong>Are there security concerns for the PQC algorithm implementations?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> Well, we haven\u2019t done it before. It hasn\u2019t been battle-tested. And now what we\u2019re saying is, \u201cHey, AMD and the rest of the hardware or semiconductor world go and put all those new algorithms in hardware, and trust us, they\u2019re going to work fine, and then nobody\u2019s going to be able to hack them and extract the key.\u201d That\u2019s not easy, right? Nobody has the guts to say this.</p><p>That\u2019s why, at PQShield, we have vulnerability teams that are trying to break our own designs, separately from those teams who are designing things. You have to do this. You need to be one step ahead of attackers. That\u2019s all you need to do, and that\u2019s all you can do, because you can\u2019t say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got something that is secure. Nobody can break it.\u201d If you say that, you\u2019re going eat a humble pie in 10 years\u2019 time, because maybe someone will come up with a way to break it. You need to just do this continuous innovation and continuous security testing for your products.</p><p>Because PQC is new, we still haven\u2019t seen all the creativity of attackers trying to bypass the beautiful mathematics, and come up with those creative and nasty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\" target=\"_blank\">side-channel attacks</a> that just laugh at the mathematics. For example, some attacks look at the energy consumption the algorithm is taking on your laptop, and they extract the key from the differences in energy consumption. Or there are timing attacks that look at how long it takes for you to encrypt the same message 100 times and how that\u2019s changing, and they can actually extract the key. So there are different ways to attack algorithms there, and that\u2019s not new. We just don\u2019t have billions of these devices in in our hands now that have post-quantum cryptography that people have tested.</p><h2>Progress in PQC Adoption</h2><p><strong>How would you say adoption has been going so far?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> The fact that a lot of companies only started when the standards were published, it puts us in a position where there are some that are well advanced in their thoughts and their processes and their adoption, and there are others that are totally new to it because they were not paying attention, and they were just kicking the can down the road. The majority of those who were kicking the can down the road are the ones that don\u2019t sit high up in the supply chain, because they felt like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s responsibility. But they didn\u2019t understand that they have they had to influence their suppliers when it comes to their requirements and timelines and integration and so many things that they have to prepare. This is what\u2019s going on now: A lot of them are doing a lot of work.</p><p>Now, those who sit high up in the supply chain, quite a few of them have made great progress and started embedding post-quantum cryptography designs into new products, and are trying to work out a way to upgrade products that are already on the ground.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re in in a great place, where everyone is doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. That\u2019s not the case. But I think that from last year, when many people were asking \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d and are now asking \u201cHow can I be compliant? Where do you think I should start? And how can I evaluate where the infrastructure to understand where the most valuable assets are, and how can I protect them? What influence can I exercise on my suppliers?\u201d I think huge progress has been made.</p><p>Is it enough? It\u2019s never enough in security. Security is damn difficult. It\u2019s a multi-disciplinary topic. There are two types of people: Those who love to build security products, and those who would love to break them. We\u2019re trying to get most of those who love to break them into the right side of history so that they can make products stronger rather than actually making existing ones vulnerable for exploitation.</p><p><strong>Do you think we\u2019re going to make it by 2035?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> I think that the majority of our infrastructure should be post quantum secure by 2035, and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s a good thought to have. Now, what happens if quantum computers happen to become reality before that? That\u2019s a good topic for a TV series or for a movie. What happens when most secrets are readable? People are not thinking hard enough about it. I don\u2019t think that anyone has an answer for that. <strong></strong></p>"

The IEEE member credits the class\u2019s professor with sparking his interest in the technology.</p><p>\u201cHis teaching style was engaging and incredibly effective,\u201d Rudra says. \u201cIt made me genuinely fall in love with the subject. The combination of hands-on lab experiments and deep theoretical learning finally gave me clarity that this was the field I wanted to pursue.\u201d</p><h3>Kamal Rudra</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>IBM Research in Albany, N.Y.</p><p><strong>Title: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Research and development integration engineer</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Member</p><p><strong>Alma maters: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology in Allahabad, India; University of Michigan in Ann Arbor</p><p><span>A research and development integration engineer at </span><a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/labs/albany\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Research</a><span> in Albany, N.Y., </span>Rudra is now working on back-end-of-line (BEOL) integrated circuits to create copper wiring structures for logic technologies.<span></span></p><p>\u201cWith the advent of novel transistor architectures, we are paving the way for faster and more-energy-efficient processors for AI and other uses,\u201d Rudra says. \u201cBy improving the BEOL interconnects, RC delay and electromigration can be reduced, ensuring transistor-level gains translate into system-level performance.\u201d</p><p>For his work, he was recognized last year on the <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/insider-membership-news/top-30-early-career-professionals-2024-honorees/\" target=\"_blank\">Top 30 Early Career Professionals in Computing</a> list and received US $2,500.</p><p>The Computer Society recognition \u201creinforces my belief that I\u2019m moving in the right direction,\u201d Rudra says, \u201cand it encourages me to keep pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in semiconductor technology and computing.\u201d</p><h2>Inspired by a physics teacher</h2><p>Like many engineers, Rudra was fascinated by how things worked as a youngster. Growing up in India, he would take apart remote-controlled cars and use the motors and batteries to build something new.</p><p>No one in his family worked in science, technology, engineering, or math, he says, but science has always felt \u201ccompletely natural.\u201d</p><p>His fascination with STEM subjects deepened in high school, and his teachers fueled his passion. But it was M.R. Shenoy, a physics professor at the <a href=\"https://home.iitd.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>, who inspired him to pursue research in the semiconductor field.</p><p>As an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://www.mnnit.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology</a>, in Allahabad, India, Rudra took an online semiconductor optoelectronics certification course offered by NPTEL that was taught by Shenoy.</p><p>Motivated to gain experience in the field, from 2017 to 2019 Rudra completed several internships working on semiconductor fabrication at organizations including the <a href=\"https://iitbhu.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of technology (BHU)</a>, Varanasi; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology</a>, Kharagpur; and the <a href=\"https://www.ceeri.res.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute</a>.</p><p>\u201cThese internships were my first real exposure to experimental research and gave me a foundation in device physics and material science,\u201d he says.</p><p>He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communications engineering from MNNIT in 2019.</p><h2>Working in semiconductor fabrication and FinFET</h2><p>After graduating he became a research assistant at the <a href=\"https://iisc.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), in Bengaluru.</p><p>There he developed a thin film of manganese vanadium oxide using the epitaxy process. The method grows the manganese vanadium oxide on top of the crystal substrate\u2014which gives engineers more control over the film\u2019s thickness, composition, and crystal structure, according to <a href=\"https://www.photonics.com/EDU/epitaxial_deposition/d8286\" target=\"_blank\">Photonics Media</a>. Rudra used the film to develop a photodetector for infrared light.</p><p>After a year he joined semiconductor manufacturer <a href=\"https://gf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GlobalFoundries</a>, also in Bengaluru, as an integration and yield engineer. He continued his work at IISc on the weekends.</p><p>\u201cBefore joining, I had modest expectations\u2014largely because of the limited semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in India,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I realized that hardware-focused work was indeed happening in the industry. That experience planted the seed of transitioning from academia to cutting-edge industrial R&amp;D.\u201d</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cFor any young professional in STEM, IEEE isn\u2019t just a resource; it\u2019s a launchpad.\u201d</span></p><p><span></span>While at GlobalFoundries, he worked on BEOL interconnects to enhance the yield of the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-foundry-finfet\" target=\"_self\">FinFET</a> chips, which are used in automotive technology, smartphones, and smart speakers. In conventional planar transistors, the gate sits atop a flat silicon channel, controlling the flow of current between the source and drain from only one side. As transistors shrank in size, however, they became <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">less reliable and leaked current,</a> wasting power. FinFET development was led by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">Chenming Hu</a>, who received the 2020<a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for the invention. FinFET\u2019s 3D structure provides better control of the current.</p><p>In 2021 Rudra decided to continue his education and was accepted into the master\u2019s degree program in electrical and computer engineering at the <a href=\"https://odei.umich.edu/2023/10/19/university-of-michigan-celebrates-first-generation-college-students-during-week-long-events/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor.</p><p>\u201cI chose this school because there was a particular professor working on LED devices whose research really resonated with me,\u201d he says. The professor, <a href=\"https://mi.engin.umich.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Fellow Zetian Mi</a>, was working on III-V semiconductor optoelectronic devices. Rudra was part of Mi\u2019s research team for the first two semesters of his graduate program, working on the fabrication and characterization of III-Nitride-based microLEDs. Rudra also completed an internship at <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> in Redmond, Wash., where he developed integration processes for waveguide-based photonic devices for AR/VR systems.</p><p>\u201cThat experience helped me understand how photonics intersects with semiconductor manufacturing,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly in emerging applications like next-gen displays and wearable optics.\u201d</p><p>After earning his degree in 2023, he joined <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Semiconductor</a> in Austin, Texas, as a device integration engineer. There he returned to working on FinFETs, but this time analyzing and optimizing device and front-end-of-line integration for 14-nm node technology and how different processes affect the electrical performance and yield of FinFETs.</p><p>After a year, he left to join IBM Research.</p><p>\u201cBeing part of such a high-impact, globally collaborative initiative has been a fantastic experience and one that continues to push me technically and professionally,\u201d he says.</p><p>Since working at the company, he has filed 22 U.S. patents.</p><p>He received a slew of honors last year, including being named to<a href=\"https://www.semiconwest.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon West</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30 list, the<a href=\"https://www.sme.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Society of Manufacturing Engineers</a>\u2019s 30 Under 30, and<a href=\"https://www.semiconeuropa.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon Europa</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30. Recently, he made the<a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/albany/\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Albany Business Review</em></em></a> 40 Under 40 list.</p><p>\u201cThese recognitions,\u201d he says, \u201chave been deeply motivating\u2014not just as personal milestones but as validation of the collective work I\u2019ve been part of, and the mentors who\u2019ve helped shape my path.\u201d</p><h2>Making important connections at IEEE</h2><p>Rudra joined IEEE in 2020 after his <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9117916\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cVisible Light Response in Defect Engineered Wrinkle Network Nanostructured ZnO\u201d</a> research paper was accepted by the <a href=\"https://edtm2025.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Electron Devices Technology and Manufacturing Conference</a>. He continues to renew his membership, he says, because of the networking opportunities it provides, as well as technical content that helps him stay up to date on semiconductors.</p><p>In addition to the IEEE Computer Society, he is an active member of the IEEE <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Electron Devices</a> (EDS), <a href=\"https://eps.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Electronics Packaging</a>, and<a href=\"https://ieeephotonics.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Photonics</a> societies. Each \u201cis home to a vibrant network of engineers, scientists, and innovators who are accomplished in their respective fields,\u201d Rudra says.</p><p>In 2022 he received an <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/education/student-fellowships/masters-student-fellowship\" target=\"_blank\">Electron Devices Society master\u2019s fellowship</a>, which awarded him $2,000 to use toward research within the society\u2019s fields of interest. Receiving the honor, he says, was a powerful motivator.</p><p>He is active with <a href=\"https://yp.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Young Professionals</a> and is a member of the Electron Devices Society\u2019s YP committee. Being a part of the community, he says, gives him access to world-class expertise and provides resources to help him make career decisions and solve technical challenges.</p><p>He is also a part of the organizing committee for this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/education/summer-schools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE EDS Summer School</a>, a two-day lecture program for university seniors, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young professionals.</p><p>\u201cFor any young professional in STEM, I believe IEEE isn\u2019t just a resource; it\u2019s a launchpad,\u201d Rudra says. \u201cGetting involved early helps you grow technically, professionally, and personally in a way few organizations can offer.\u201d</p>"

These days, he says, farming in Nigeria can look quite different, depending on whether the farmer has access to the Internet or not.</p><p>Not far away, farmers are using drones to map their plots and calculate their fertilizer inputs. Elsewhere, farmers can swipe through security camera footage of their fields on their mobile phones. That saves them from having to patrol the farm\u2019s perimeter and potentially dangerous confrontations with thieves.

They\u2019re among the<a href=\"https://www.submarinecablemap.com/region/africa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 75 cables</a> that now connect coastal Africa to the rest of the world. Nigeria\u2019s big telecom operators continue to build long-distance, high-capacity fiber-optic networks from the cables to the important commercial nodes in the cities. But distribution to the urban peripheries and to rural places such as Atan is still incomplete.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Incomplete is an understatement: <a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Less than half</a> of the country\u2019s 237 million people have regular access to broadband, with that access mostly happening through <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/statistics-reports/subscriber-data#monthly-subscriber-technology-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mobile devices</a> rather than more stable fixed connections. Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy has set a goal to almost double the length of the country\u2019s fiber-optic backbone and for broadband to reach <a href=\"https://fmcide.gov.ng/ministry-launches-national-broadband-alliance-for-nigeria-nban-to-drive-broadband-connectivity-and-infrastructure-development/\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent of the population</a> by the end of this year. But the ministry also<a href=\"https://von.gov.ng/fg-launches-774-lg-internet-connectivity-project/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> claimed in 2024</a> that it would connect Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments to the broadband backbone; as of February 2025, it had reached only 51. The broadband buildout has been seriously hampered by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nigeria-power-grid\" target=\"_blank\">Nigeria\u2019s unreliable power grid</a>. Beyond the mere inconvenience of frequent outages, the poor quality of electricity drives up costs for operators and customers alike.</p><p>During a visit to Nigeria earlier this year, I talked to dozens of people about broadband\u2019s impact on their lives. For more than two decades, the country has possessed an incredible portal to the world, and so I had hoped to hear stories of transformation. In some cases, I did. But that experience was far from uniform, with much work left to do.</p><h2>Where Nigeria\u2019s broadband has arrived</h2><p>Broadband is enabling all kinds of changes in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country. All eight undersea cables make landfall in Lagos, the cultural, commercial, and one-time federal capital of Nigeria, and one of the cables also lands near Port Harcourt to the southeast. The country\u2019s fiber-optic backbones\u2014which in early 2025 consisted of about 50,000 to 60,000 kilometers of fiber-optic cable\u2014connect the undersea links to the cities.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A small map of Africa showing Nigeria in orange, with 4 detailed maps of Nigeria showing the progressive buildout of fiber-optic lines from 2008, 2015, 2020, and 2025. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b9701\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-small-map-of-africa-showing-nigeria-in-orange-with-4-detailed-maps-of-nigeria-showing-the-progressive-buildout-of-fiber-optic.png?id=61426677&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">From 2008 to 2025, Nigeria has experienced extraordinary growth in both the number of undersea high-speed cables landing on its shores and the buildout of broadband networks, especially in its cities. Still, fixed-line broadband is unaffordable for most Nigerians, and about half of the population has no access. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.africabandwidthmaps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Bandwidth Maps</a></small></p><p>\u201cVirtually everywhere in Nigeria is covered with long-haul cables,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulndigital/\" target=\"_blank\">Abdullateef Aliyu</a>, general manager for projects at<a href=\"https://www.phase3telecom.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Phase3 Telecom</a>, which is responsible for perhaps 10,000 km of those cables. Most Nigerian cities have at least one fiber-optic backbone, and the biggest have more than half a dozen.</p><p>The result is that the most densely populated areas enjoy competing Internet service providers offering fiber optics or satellite to the home.

If you want to serve international customers or do high-speed stock trading, you need a reliable link to the outside world, and in Nigeria that means Victoria Island.</p><p>Here, the fiber-optic cables rise like thick vines in gray rooms on the ground floors or in the basements of the office towers that house the banks powering Nigerian finance. Between the towers, shopping plazas host foreign fast-food franchises and caf\u00e9s.</p><p>From their perch near the submarine network, the banks realized that mobile broadband would allow them to reach exponentially more customers, especially once those customers could take advantage of <a href=\"https://fastpayments.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/World_Bank_FPS_Nigeria_NIBSS_Case_Study.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Nigeria\u2019s instant-payment system</a>, launched by the central bank in 2011. Using mobile payments, bank apps, and other financial apps, Nigerians can conduct convenient cellphone transactions for anything from street food to airplane tickets. The<a href=\"https://paystack.com/blog/operations/nibss-instant-payments-nip\" target=\"_blank\"> central bank\u2019s platform</a> was such a success that until recently, it handled more money than its U.S. equivalents.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nigeria-money\" target=\"_blank\">As Nigeria\u2019s Cashless Transition Falters, POS Operators Thrive</a></p><p>Just as important as convenience is trust. Nigerians trust each other so little that a university guesthouse I stayed in had its name printed on the wall-mounted air conditioner units to discourage theft. But Nigerians trust mobile payments. Uber drivers think nothing of sharing their bank account numbers with passengers, so that the passengers can pay their fares via instant payment. A Nigerian engineer explained to me that many people prefer that to disclosing their bank-card information on the Uber platform.</p><p>Broadband has also brought change to <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/com/articles/nollywood-the-next-big-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">Nollywood</a>, Nigeria\u2019s vast film industry, second only to India\u2019s Bollywood in terms of worldwide film output.

On the other hand, streaming platforms made it easier for Nigerians to access foreign video content, cutting into local producers\u2019 market share.

The spotty power grid means that standard telecom equipment needs backup power. But battery or diesel-powered cellphone towers attract theft, which in turn undermines network reliability.

NTEL backs up the grid electricity with a battery bank and two generators.</p><h2>In Nigeria, mobile broadband is popular</h2><p>What is often missing in Nigeria is the local connection, the last few kilometers leading to customers. In the developed world, that connection works like this: Internet service providers (ISPs) plug into the nearest backbone via one of several technologies and deliver a small slice of bandwidth to their business and residential customers. A switching station called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence\" target=\"_blank\">point of presence</a> (PoP) serves as an on- and off-ramp between the backbone and the ISPs. The ISPs are responsible for installing the fiber-optic cables that lead to their customers; they may also use microwave antennas to beam a signal to customers.</p><p>But in Nigeria, fiber-optic ISPs have been sluggish to capture market share. Of the country\u2019s<a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/internet-service-operator-data\" target=\"_blank\"> 300,000 or so fixed-line broadband subscribers</a>\u2014just 0.001 percent of Nigerians\u2014about a third are served by the leading ISP, <a href=\"https://spectranet.com.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectranet</a>. By comparison, the average fixed broadband penetration rate among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/broadband-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\">42.5 percent in 2023</a>, led by South Korea, with 89.6 percent penetration. </p><p>Starlink\u2019s satellite-based service, <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2025/starlink-nigeria-internet-elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced in Nigeria in 2023</a>, is now the second biggest broadband ISP, with about 60,000 subscribers. That\u2019s almost triple the third biggest ISP, <a href=\"https://fob.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">FiberOne</a>. Satellite is outcompeting fiber because it\u2019s more reliable and has <a href=\"https://www.ookla.com/articles/starlink-ssa-q1-2025\" target=\"_blank\">higher speeds and tolerable latency</a>, even though it costs more. A Starlink satellite terminal can serve up to 200 subscribers and retails for about US $200 plus a $37 monthly fee. A comparable fiber-to-the-home plan in Abuja, where the median monthly take-home pay is $280, costs about $19 a month.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a row of color display cases holding cellphones, with signs offering phone and laptop repair.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"57d0f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-row-of-color-display-cases-holding-cellphones-with-signs-offering-phone-and-laptop-repair.jpg?id=61426635&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In Lagos\u2019s Computer Village, you can buy or sell a mobile phone or computer, or get yours repaired.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>Meanwhile, Nigeria has <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/subscriber-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">142 million cellular subscriptions</a>, and so most Internet users access the Internet wirelessly, via a mobile network. In other words, Nigeria\u2019s mobile market is nearly 500 times as big as the market for fixed broadband. The mobile networks also rely on the fiber-optic backbones, but instead of using PoP gateways, they link to cellular base stations, each of which can reach up to thousands of mobile devices but may not offer ideal quality of service. </p><p>Mobile Internet is a good thing for people who can afford it, which is<a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" target=\"_blank\"> most Nigerians</a>, according to the <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/\" target=\"_blank\">International Telecommunication Union</a>. The cost of fixed-line broadband is still around five times as much, which explains why its market share is so tiny. But mobile Internet isn\u2019t enough to run many businesses, nor do mobile network operators guarantee network speeds or low latency, which are crucial factors for high-frequency trading, telemedicine, and e-commerce, and for white-collar jobs requiring streaming video calls.</p><h2>Nigeria is 129th in the world in Internet speeds</h2><p>Internet speeds across Nigeria vary, but broadband tester Ookla\u2019s spring 2025 median for fixed broadband was 28 megabits per second for downloads and 15 Mb/s for uploads, with latency of 25 milliseconds. That puts Nigeria 129th in the world for fixed broadband. In May, Starlink delivered download speeds between 44 and 50 Mb/s, uploads of around 12 Mb/s, and latency of around 61 ms. The top country, <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/singapore\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore</a>, averaged 393 Mb/s down and 286 Mb/s up, with 4 ms latency. And those numbers for Nigeria don\u2019t capture the effect of unpredictable electricity cuts.</p><p><a href=\"https://nileuniversity.edu.ng/staff/professor-steve-a-adeshina/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve A. Adeshina</a>, a computer engineering professor and machine-vision expert at <a href=\"https://nileuniversity.edu.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">Nile University</a>, in the capital city of Abuja, says he routinely runs up against the limits of Nigeria\u2019s broadband network. That\u2019s why he keeps two personal cellular modems on his desk. His university contracts with several Internet providers, but the broadband in his lab is still intermittent. For machine-vision research, with its huge datasets, failing to upload data stored on his local machine to the more powerful cloud processor where he runs his experiments means failing to work. \u201cWe have optical fiber, but we are not getting value for money,\u201d Adeshina says. If he wakes up to a failed overnight data upload, he has to start it all over again.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/modernizing-nigerian-voting-system\" target=\"_self\">The Engineer Who Secured Nigeria\u2019s Democracy</a></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Photo of tangled black cables spilling from a rectangular opening in the sidewalk, with street traffic and a distinctive tall building in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"05309\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-tangled-black-cables-spilling-from-a-rectangular-opening-in-the-sidewalk-with-street-traffic-and-a-distinctive-tall-bu.jpg?id=61426638&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Fiber-optic cable spills from an open manhole in Lagos. Local gangs may cut the cables or steal components. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>There are many causes for the slow Internet, but chief among them are frequent cable cuts\u2014<a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/50000-incidents-recorded-in-2024-fg-sets-up-panel-to-address-telecoms-cables-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">50,000 in 2024</a>, according to the federal government. The problem is so bad that in February, the government established a committee to prevent network blackouts due to cable cuts during road construction, which it blamed for 60 percent of the incidents.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is reaching the hinterland,\u201d Aliyu of Phase3 Telecom says, and keeping lines intact once there. To make his point, Aliyu, dressed in a snappy three-piece suit and red tie, drives a company pickup truck from Phase3\u2019s well-appointed offices in a leafy part of Abuja to a nearby ring road. He pulls over in the shade of an overpass and steps onto the dirt shoulder. A concrete manhole cover sits perched along one edge of an open manhole, looking like the lid of a sarcophagus.</p><p>Pointing at the hole, Aliyu explains how easy it is for local gangs, called area boys, to steal components or cut the cables, forcing backbone providers and ISPs to strike unofficial security deals with the boys, or the more powerful, shadowy men behind them. Of course, part of the problem is self-inflicted: Sloppy work crews leave manholes open and expose the cables to potential damage from nesting animals or a stray cigarette butt that ignites tumbleweed and melts the cables.</p><p>Phase3 and other telecom companies are also contending with the expense of replacing the first generation of fiber-optic cables, now about 20 years old, as well as upgrading PoP hardware to increase capacity. They\u2019re spending money not just to reach new customers, but also to provide competitive service to existing customers.</p><p>For mobile operators such as Globacom, there\u2019s the additional challenge of ensuring reliable power for their base stations. They often rely on diesel or gasoline generators to back up grid power, but fuel scarcity, infrastructure theft, and supply chain issues can undermine base station reliability.</p><h2>How Nigeria\u2019s offline half lives</h2><p>The hamlet of <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/553626-special-report-inside-abujas-forgotten-communities-lacking-basic-amenities-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tungan Ashere</a> is 3 km northwest of the major international airport serving Abuja. To get here, you leave the highway and drive past cinder-block huts with traditional reed roofs. The side of the dirt road is adorned with concrete pylons waiting to be strung with power lines but still naked as the day they were installed in 2021. People here farm cassava, watermelon, yam, and corn. Some keep small herds of goats and cattle. To get to market, they can ride on one of a handful of dirt-bike taxis.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a plastic tarp covering a round green structure on a platform, with a group of people gathered inside.

The metal resonates, not quite like a church bell, but it serves a similar purpose. \u201cThe bell, it\u2019s to tell everybody to go to sleep, to wake up, if there\u2019s an announcement. It\u2019s an ancient way of communicating,\u201d explains Lukman Aliu, a telecom engineer who drove me here.</p><p>The concept of connectivity in the village differs from just a few kilometers away at the airport, where passengers can enjoy free high-speed Wi-Fi in the comfort of a caf\u00e9. Yet the potential benefits of affordable broadband access for people living in places like Tungan Ashere are enormous.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usman.isah.5205?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\" target=\"_blank\">Usman Isah Dandari</a> is trying to meet that need. He is a technical assistant at the <a href=\"https://citad.org.ng/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD)</a>, a nonprofit based in Kano, Nigeria. Dandari coordinates a handful of community networking projects, including one in Tungan Ashere. Better broadband here would help farmers track market prices, help students complete their homework, and make it easier for farmers and craftspeople to advertise their goods. CITAD uses a mixture of hardware, including Starlink terminals and cellular modems, to offer relatively reliable broadband to areas neglected by commercial operators. The group is also considering using Nigeria\u2019s national satellite operator, <a href=\"https://nigcomsat.gov.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">NigComSat</a>, and working with the Nigerian Communications Commission to lower the costs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a man in Nigerian garb standing in front of a seated group of mainly children who are looking at tablets.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10785\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-man-in-nigerian-garb-standing-in-front-of-a-seated-group-of-mainly-children-who-are-looking-at-tablets.jpg?id=61426661&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Usman Isah Dandari [standing] coordinates several projects like the one in Tungan Ashere, to provide affordable broadband access.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>A few meters away from the scrap-metal bell in Tungan Ashere is a one-story building painted rust red, topped with a pastel green corrugated metal roof and eight solar panels, which power a computer lab inside. There\u2019s no grid electricity here, but the solar panels are enough to run a CITAD-provided cellular modem, a few desktop computers, and a formidable floor fan some of the time.</p><p>Many of the people in the village once lived where the airport is now. The Nigerian government<a href=\"https://dailytrust.com/the-sad-story-of-communities-displaced-for-abuja-airport/\" target=\"_blank\"> displaced them</a> when it chose the region as the new federal capital territory in 1991. Since then, successive local governments have provided services piecemeal, usually in the runup to elections. The result is a string of communities like Tungan Ashere\u201410,000 people in all\u2014that still lack running water, paved roads, grid electricity, and reliable Internet. These people may live on the edge of Nigeria\u2019s broadband backbone, but they reap few of its benefits.</p><h2>A private undersea cable shows how to do it</h2><p>Not every undersea cable rollout has been fraught. In 2005, electrical engineer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funke_Opeke\" target=\"_blank\">Funke Opeke</a> was working at Verizon Communications in the United States. <a href=\"https://www.mtn.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">MTN</a>, an African telecom company, hired her to help it build its submarine cables. Then Nitel hired her to help manage its privatization. There, she saw up close how the organization was failing to get the Internet from SAT-3 into Nigerians\u2019 lives.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a woman seated at a table with her hands folded in front of her.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3565a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-woman-seated-at-a-table-with-her-hands-folded-in-front-of-her.jpg?id=61426663&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Funke Opeke founded MainOne to build Nigeria\u2019s first private undersea fiber-optic cable.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Osodi/Bloomberg/Getty Images</small></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a question of capital or return on investment, policy, or interest,\u201d Opeke says. Instead, officials favored suppliers offering kickbacks over those with competent bids.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity for a well-managed submarine cable, Opeke approached private investors about developing a cable of their own. The result is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_One\" target=\"_blank\">MainOne cable</a>, which arrived in Lagos in 2010 and is operated by the company of the same name. MainOne offered the first private competition to Nitel\u2019s SAT-3 and Globacom\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLO-1\" target=\"_blank\">Glo-1</a>, which began service in 2010. (MTN\u2019s two cables landed in Nigeria in 2011.)</p><p>At first, the MainOne cable suffered the same problem as the others\u2014its capacity wasn\u2019t reaching users. \u201cAfter we built, there was no distribution,\u201d Opeke, who\u2019s now an advisor with MainOne, says. So the company got its own ISP license and began building fiber links into major metro areas\u2014eventually <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/04/equinix-enters-africa-closing-the-us-320-million-acquisition-of-mainone\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,200 km</a> in states near its undersea-cable landing site. It ended up offering a more complete service than originally intended, bringing the Internet from overseas, onshore, across Nigeria, and the last kilometers into businesses and homes, and it attracted more than 800 business clients.</p><p>MainOne\u2019s success forced the publicly held telecoms and the mobile providers to compete. \u201cThe mobile networks were built for voice, and they were not investing fast enough\u201d in data capacity, Opeke says. MainOne did invest, helping to create the broadband capacity needed for Nigeria\u2019s first data centers. It then diversified into data centers, and in 2022 sold its whole business to American data-center giant <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Equinix</a>.</p><p>Other companies, including the major mobile operators, also began building fiber between Nigerian cities, duplicating each other\u2019s infrastructure. The problem is they didn\u2019t offer competitive prices to independent ISPs that wanted to piggyback on those new fiber-optic links, says the telecom analyst Odufuwa.</p><p>And neither the public sector nor the private sector is meeting the needs of Nigerians at the bottom of the market, especially in rural communities such as Tungan Ashere and Atan. A crucial first step will be to improve the reliability of the electrical grid, Opeke says, which will help drive down costs for telecom operators and other businesses, and create a virtuous cycle for further growth.</p><p>Almost everyone <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> interviewed for this story said security is another challenge: If Nigerian states and the federal government could ensure the security of the infrastructure, telecom operators would invest more in expanding their networks. Building telecom infrastructure is well within the reach of Nigerian engineers. \u201cNigeria doesn\u2019t have a skill problem,\u201d Opeke says. \u201cIt has an opportunity problem.\u201d</p><p>If the bureaucrats, businesspeople, and engineers can overcome those policy and technical hurdles, the unconnected half of Nigerians stand to gain a lot. Reliable broadband in Atan would draw more young people to agriculture, says the farmer and sociologist Bolaji Adeniyi: \u201cIt will provide jobs.\u201d Then, like Adeniyi, maybe those young connected Nigerians will reconsider whether farming is just father\u2019s work\u2014perhaps it could be their future, too. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Special thanks to IEEE Senior Member John Funso-Adebayo for his assistance with the logistics and reporting for this story. </em></p>"

They describe the challenges they face and what they see as the path forward for a continent brimming with aspiring engineers but woefully short on the resources necessary for a robust education.</p><p><span></span>\u2014Harry Goldstein</p><p>In high school, I studied physics, chemistry, maths, and biology. When I started studying at <a href=\"https://mak.ac.ug/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Makerere University</a>, in Kampala, I joined the computer science program. This was in 2003. I had never interfaced with a computer before, and this was true for many of my classmates. The limited number of computers meant that student Internet caf\u00e9s were common, requiring one to pay 500 Ugandan shillings (US $0.14) for 30 minutes. Access to programmable hardware was limited, with no access to microcontrollers or hardware manufacturing.</p><p>Once I got the basic introduction to computer science, I was eager to build things with what was available to solve problems for the people around me. At the time, phones were very limited, and it was expensive to make calls, so SMS text messages were very popular. Students, the majority of whom didn\u2019t own phones, needed some way to send texts without one. In my first year, I built a free Web-based SMS platform that allowed people to send messages easily. It quickly gained popularity among university students\u2014a good outcome for my first \u201cproduct.\u201d</p><p>After I graduated in 2006 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, Professor <a href=\"https://www.mak.ac.ug/university-governance/university-management/central-university-management-committee/vice-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Venansius Baryamureeba</a>, then the dean of the faculty of computing and information technology at Makerere, inspired me to apply for graduate school in Belgium. I received a scholarship to pursue a master\u2019s degree at <a href=\"https://www.vub.be/nl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a> (Free University of Brussels).</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">Related: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What I Learned From a Janky Drone</a></p><p><span>There, I encountered </span><a href=\"https://store.arduino.cc/collections/boards-modules?srsltid=AfmBOoo6j7uyuivD-jIrO3r50fdmDsC58rJERiVV_nSgbECi-Y3tO1sa\" target=\"_blank\">Arduino microcontroller boards</a><span> for the first time. I witnessed undergraduate students using Arduino boards and sensors to implement embedded-systems projects, such as autonomous devices that could detect, identify, sense, and control their surroundings. I wondered how long it would take for universities in Africa to gain access to such hardware. After all, Arduino\u2019s motto is \u201cEmpowering anyone to innovate,\u201d but unfortunately, that empowerment had yet to reach sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p><p>Fast forward to today, and the situation has drastically changed. Laptops are now widely available in Africa, Internet connectivity is faster, and smartphones and mobile Internet are common among computer science faculty and students. But the lag between the launch of a technology and its availability in Africa remains significant, as Oluwatosin Kolade\u2019s story illustrates [see \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-i-learned-from-a-janky-drone\" target=\"_blank\">Lessons from a Janky Drone</a>,\u201d].</p><p>Africa has immense potential for computer science and electronics engineering to address a wide range of challenges. Existing software solutions may be insufficient, and the public digital infrastructure may be lacking, so projects at the intersection of hardware and software could fill critical gaps. However, it is crucial for students to get better learning opportunities <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/african-robotics-network\" target=\"_blank\">to interact with and build physical systems</a>. There is a wide range of exciting applications in agriculture, transportation, education, and environmental monitoring, which is likely why Kolade\u2019s engineering professor encouraged his team\u2019s surveillance drone project despite the difficulties they encountered.</p><h2>Access to Hardware Remains a Bottleneck </h2><p>While the bottlenecks in hardware access for students and researchers in Africa have eased since my time as a student, obstacles persist. As Kolade attests, significant challenges exist in both scholastic funding and the supply chain. This hampers learning and places a large financial burden on young people. As Kolade explains, students must fund their undergraduate projects out of their own pockets, creating significant barriers for people with limited financial resources.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A pair of hands holding two circuit boards.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"41558\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-pair-of-hands-holding-two-circuit-boards.jpg?id=61482900&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The AirQo project [circuit boards shown here] gives students access to 3D printers, soldering stations, and basic sensor boards and components.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>Electronics components must often be sourced from outside the continent, primarily from China, Europe, or the United States. While the number of online stores has increased, the time span from order to delivery can be several months. It is not uncommon for affordable shipping options to require 60 days or more, while faster delivery options can be several times more expensive than the hardware itself. Online shopping, while often necessary, presents an unavoidable complexity for students and faculty, especially if they have limited access to credit and debit cards. By contrast, students in Europe can receive their components within a week, allowing them to complete a hardware project and initiate new iterations before their counterparts in Africa even receive their hardware for initial building. What\u2019s more, some vendors may choose not to ship to addresses in Africa due to transit risks coupled with real or perceived customs complexities.</p><p>Customs and tax clearance procedures can indeed be burdensome, with import duties of up to 75 percent in some countries. While some countries in the region offer tax exemptions for educational resources, such exemptions are often difficult to obtain for individual components, or the procedures are unclear and cumbersome. Local vendors, mostly startups and tech hubs, are emerging, but they often lack sufficient stock and may not be able to fulfill bulk orders from educational institutions.</p><h2>Hardware Access Can Accelerate Education </h2><p>In light of these challenges, universities and students might be tempted to shift their focus to purely software projects or otherwise alter their priorities. However, this limits both education and innovation. Engineering projects that involve both hardware and software awaken students\u2019 creativity and foster in-depth skills acquisition.</p><p>Africa must seek viable solutions. University programs should increase their support of students by providing access to specialized makerspaces and fabrication hubs equipped with the necessary hardware and electronic components. The emergence of high-end makerspaces is encouraging, but the focus should be on providing essential components, such as sensors. Students can learn only so much in makerspaces that have 3D printers but no 3D-printing filament, or printed circuit board fabrication and assembly but no sensor components.</p><p>Community groups and workshops focused on hardware projects can help address the accessibility challenges. These communities could tap into the global open-source hardware groups for education and research. <a href=\"https://www.datascienceafrica.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Science Africa</a>, a nonprofit that trains Africans in data science and machine learning, has run hardware sessions that could potentially be scaled to reach many more students. The emergence of research teams working on large-scale projects involving the development and deployment of hardware systems also presents opportunities for students and staff to access facilities and prototype quickly. Showcasing hardware projects from the continent and sharing lessons learned, successful or not, can inspire new projects. For example, at Makerere University\u2014where I am now a computer science professor and the department chair\u2014the <a href=\"https://www.airqo.net/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">AirQo</a> project, which focuses on environmental sensing, provides access to key equipment, including 3D printers, soldering stations, and basic sensor boards and other electronic components.</p><p>Despite the persistent challenges of supply-chain delays, import duties, and limited local vendors that continue to hamper access to hardware across African universities, the continent\u2019s engineering students and educators are finding creative ways to build, innovate, and learn. From my own journey from rural Uganda to pioneering SMS platforms and the emergence of makerspaces and research projects like AirQo, to collaborative communities that connect local innovators with global open-source networks, Africa is steadily closing the technology gap.</p><p>The question is no longer whether African students can compete in hardware innovation\u2014it\u2019s how quickly the world will recognize that some of tomorrow\u2019s groundbreaking solutions are already being prototyped in labs from Kampala to Cape Town. They are being built by students like Oluwatosin Kolade, who learned to engineer solutions with whatever he could get his hands on. Imagine what they could do if they had access to the same resources I had in graduate school. African engineering potential is limitless, but to reach our full potential, we need access to technology that is more readily available in much of the world. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

They describe the challenges they face and what they see as the path forward for a continent brimming with aspiring engineers but woefully short on the resources necessary for a robust education.</p><p>\u2014Harry Goldstein</p><p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Oluwaseun-K-Ajayi-Lab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Oluwaseun K. Ajayi</a>, an expert in computer-aided design (CAD), machine design, and mechanisms, gave us the freedom to choose our final project. I proposed a research project based on a paper titled \u201c<em>Advance Simulation Method for Wheel-Terrain Interactions of Space Rovers: A Case Study on the UAE Rashid Rover</em>\u201d by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&amp;query=Abubakar,+A\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ahmad Abubakar</a> and coauthors<em><em>.</em></em> But due to the computational resources required, it was rejected. Dr. Ajayi instead proposed that my fellow students and I build a surveillance drone, as it aligned with his own research. Dr. Ajayi, a passionate and driven researcher, was motivated by the potential real-world applications of our project. His constant push for progress, while sometimes overwhelming, was rooted in his desire to see us produce meaningful work.</p><p>As my team finished scoping out the preliminary concepts of the drone in CAD designs, we were ready to contribute money toward implementing our idea. We conducted a cost analysis and decided to use a third-party vendor to help us order our components from China. We went this route due to shipping and customs issues we\u2019d previously experienced. Taking the third-party route was supposed to solve the problem. Little did we suspect what was coming.</p><p>By the time we finalized our cost analysis and started to gather funds, the price of the components we needed had skyrocketed due to a sudden economic crisis and depreciation of the Nigerian naira by 35 percent against the U.S. dollar at the end of January 2024. This was the genesis of our problem.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">Related: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/africa-engineering-hardware\" target=\"_blank\">Learning More With Less</a></p><p>Initially, we were a group of 12, but due to the high cost per person, Dr. Ajayi asked another group, led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanaweitonbrasuoware/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tonbra Suoware</a>, to merge with mine. Tonbra\u2019s team had been planning <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/african-robotics-network\" target=\"_blank\">a robotic arm project</a> until Dr. Ajayi merged our teams and instructed us to work on the drone, with the aim of exhibiting it at the <a href=\"https://central.nasrda.gov.ng/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Space Research and Development Agency</a>, in Abuja, Nigeria. The merger increased our group to 25 members, which helped with the individual financial burden but also meant that not everyone would actively participate in the project. Many just contributed their share of the money.</p><p>Tonbra and I drove the project forward.</p><h2>Supply Chain Challenges in African Engineering Education</h2><p>With Dr. Ajayi\u2019s consent, my teammates and I scrapped the \u201csurveillance\u201d part of the drone project and raised the money for developing just the drone, totaling approximately 350,000 naira (approximately US $249). We had to cut down costs, which meant straying away from the original specifications of some of the components, like the flight controller, battery, and power-distribution board. Otherwise, the cost would have been way more unbearable.</p><p>We were set to order the components from China on 5 February 2024. Unfortunately, it was a long holiday in China, we were told, so we wouldn\u2019t get the components until March. This led to tense discussions with Dr. Ajayi, despite having briefed him about the situation. Why the pressure? Our school semester ends in March, and having components arrive in March would mean that the project would be long overdue by the time we finished it. At the same time, we students had a compulsory academic-industrial training at the end of the semester.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Young Black man in plaid shirt sitting on a chair in front of a white board and a black board\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d6b2d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/young-black-man-in-plaid-shirt-sitting-on-a-chair-in-front-of-a-white-board-and-a-black-board.png?id=61482574&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Oluwatosin Kolade, a mechanical engineering student at Nigeria\u2019s Obafemi Awolowo University, says the drone project taught him the value of failure.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>But what choice did we have? We couldn\u2019t back down from the project\u2014that would have cost us our grade.</p><p>We got most of our components by mid-March, and immediately started working on the drone. We had the frame 3D-printed at a cost of 50 naira (approximately US $0.03) per gram for a 570-gram frame, for a total cost of 28,500 naira (roughly US $18).</p><p><span>Next, we turned to building the power-distribution system for the electrical components. Initially, we\u2019d planned to use a power-distribution board to evenly distribute power from the battery to the speed controllers and the rotors. However, the board we originally ordered was no longer available. Forced to improvise, we used a </span><a href=\"https://verotl.com/circuitboards/veroboards\" target=\"_blank\">Veroboard </a><span>instead. We connected the battery in a configuration parallel to the speed controllers to ensure that each rotor received equal power. This improvisation did mean additional costs, as we had to rent soldering irons, hand drills, hot glue, cables, a digital multimeter, and other tools from an electronics hub in downtown Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300.</span></p><p><span></span>Everything was going smoothly until it was time to configure the flight controller\u2014the ArduCopter 2.8 board\u2014with the assistance of a software program called <a href=\"https://ardupilot.org/planner/\" target=\"_blank\">Mission Planner</a>. We toiled daily, combing through YouTube videos, online forums, Stack Exchange, and other resources for guidance, all to no avail. We even downgraded the Mission Planner software a couple of times, only to discover that the board we\u2019d waited for so patiently was obsolete. It was truly heartbreaking, but we couldn\u2019t order another one because we didn\u2019t have time to wait for it to arrive. Plus, getting another flight controller would\u2019ve cost an additional sum\u2014240,000 naira (about US $150) for a <a href=\"https://www.hawks-work.com/products/pixhawk-2-4-8-flight-control-open-source-px4-autopilot\" target=\"_blank\">Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller</a>\u2014which we didn\u2019t have.</p><p>We knew our drone would be half-baked without the flight controller. Still, given our semester-ending time constraint, we decided to proceed with the configuration of the transmitter and receiver. We made the final connections and tested the components without the flight controller. To ensure that the transmitter could control all four rotors simultaneously, we tested each rotor individually with each transmitter channel. The goal was to assign a single channel on the transmitter that would activate and synchronize all four rotors, allowing them to spin in unison during flight. This was crucial, because without proper synchronization, the drone would not be able to maintain a stable flight.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThis experience taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, teamwork, and the harsh realities of engineering projects done by students in Nigeria.\u201d</p><p>After the final configuration and components testing, we set out to test our drone in its final form. But a few minutes into the testing, our battery failed. This failure meant the project had failed, and we were incredibly disappointed.</p><p>When we finally submitted our project to Dr. Ajayi, the deadline had passed. He told us to charge the battery so he could see the drone come alive, even though it couldn\u2019t fly. But circumstances didn\u2019t allow us to order a battery charger, and we were at a loss as to where to get help with the flight controller and battery. There are no tech hubs available for such things in Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300. We told Dr. Ajayi we couldn\u2019t do as he\u2019d asked and explained the situation to him. He finally allowed us to submit our work, and all team members received course credit.</p><h2>Resourcefulness is not a substitute for funding</h2><p>This experience taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, teamwork, and the harsh realities of engineering projects done by students in Nigeria. It showed me that while technical knowledge is crucial, the ability to adapt and improvise when faced with unforeseen challenges is just as important. I also learned that failure, though disheartening, is not an ending but a stepping stone toward growth and improvement.</p><p>In my school, the demands on mechanical engineering students are exceptionally high. For instance, in a single semester, I was sometimes assigned up to four different major projects, each from a different professor. Alongside the drone project, I worked on two other substantial projects for other courses. The reality is that a student\u2019s ability to score well in these projects is often heavily dependent on financial resources. We are constantly burdened with the costs of running numerous projects. The country\u2019s ongoing economic challenges, including currency devaluation and inflation, only exacerbate this burden.</p><p>In essence, when the world, including graduate-school-admission committees and industry recruiters, evaluates transcripts from Nigerian engineering graduates, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that a grade may not fully reflect a student\u2019s capabilities in a given course. They can also reflect financial constraints, difficulties in sourcing equipment and materials, and the broader economic environment. This understanding must inform how transcripts are interpreted, as they tell a story not just of academic performance but also of perseverance in the face of significant challenges.</p><p>As I advance in my education, I plan to apply these lessons to future projects, knowing that perseverance and resourcefulness will be key to overcoming obstacles. The failed drone project has also given me a realistic glimpse into the working world, where unexpected setbacks and budget constraints are common. It has prepared me to approach my career with both a practical mindset and an understanding that success often comes from how well you manage difficulties, not just how well you execute plans. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

The dream is to have a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-robots\" target=\"_blank\">robot like the Jetson\u2019s Rosie</a> that can<span> </span><span>performing a range of</span><span> household </span><span>tasks, like tidying up or folding laundry. But for that to happen, the robot needs to learn from a </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/global-robotic-brain\" target=\"_blank\">large amount of data</a><span> that match real-world conditions\u2014that data can be difficult to collect. Currently, most training data is collected from multiple static cameras that have to be carefully set up to gather useful information. But what if bots could learn from the everyday interactions we already have with the physical world? </span></p><p>That\u2019s a question that the <a href=\"https://www.lerrelpinto.com/group\" target=\"_blank\">General-purpose Robotics and AI Lab</a> at New York University, led by Assistant Professor <a href=\"https://www.lerrelpinto.com/#publications\" target=\"_blank\">Lerrel Pinto</a>, hopes to answer with <a href=\"https://egozero-robot.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">EgoZero</a>, a smart-glasses system that aids robot learning by collecting data with a souped-up version of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/meta-ar-glasses-expense\" target=\"_blank\">Meta\u2019s glasses</a>. <strong></strong></p><p>In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20290\" target=\"_blank\">recent preprint</a>, which serves as a proof of concept for the approach, the researchers trained a robot to complete seven manipulation tasks, such as picking up a piece of bread and placing it on a nearby plate. For each task, they collected 20 minutes of data from humans performing these tasks while recording their actions with glasses from Meta\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.projectaria.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Aria</a>. (These sensor-laden glasses are used exclusively for research purposes.) When then deployed to autonomously complete these tasks with a robot, the system achieved a 70 percent success rate. </p><h2>The Advantage of Egocentric Data</h2><p>The \u201cego\u201d part of EgoZero refers to the \u201cegocentric\u201d nature of the data, meaning that it is collected from the perspective of the person performing a task. \u201cThe camera sort of moves with you,\u201d like how our eyes move with us, says <a href=\"https://raunaqb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Raunaq Bhirangi</a>, a postdoctoral researcher at the NYU lab. </p><p>This has two main advantages: First, the setup is more portable than external cameras. Second, the glasses are more likely to capture the information needed because wearers will make sure they\u2014and thus the camera\u2014can see what\u2019s needed to perform a task. \u201cFor instance, say I had something hooked under a table and I want to unhook it. I would bend down, look at that hook and then unhook it, as opposed to a third-person camera, which is not active,\u201d says Bhirangi. \u201cWith this egocentric perspective, you get that information baked into your data for free.\u201d</p><p>The second half of EgoZero\u2019s name refers to the fact that the system is trained without any robot data, which can be costly and difficult to collect; human data alone is enough for the robot to learn a new task. This is enabled by a framework developed by Pinto\u2019s lab that tracks points in space, rather than full images. When training robots on image-based data, \u201cthe mismatch is too large between what human hands look like and what robot arms look like,\u201d says Bhirangi. This framework instead tracks points on the hand, which are mapped onto points on the robot. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"EgoZero localizes object points via triangulation over the camera trajectory, and computes action points via Aria MPS hand pose and a hand estimation model.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d916e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/egozero-localizes-object-points-via-triangulation-over-the-camera-trajectory-and-computes-action-points-via-aria-mps-hand-pose.jpg?id=61469639&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The EgoZero system takes data from humans wearing smart glasses and turns it into usable 3D-navigation data for robots to do general manipulation tasks.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://egozero-robot.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Vincent Liu, Ademi Adeniji, Haotian Zhan, et al.</a></small></p><p>Reducing the image to points in 3D space means the model can track movement the same way, regardless of the specific robotic appendage. \u201cAs long as the robot points move relative to the object in the same way that the human points move, we\u2019re good,\u201d says Bhirangi.</p><p>All of this leads to a generalizable model that would otherwise require a lot of diverse robot data to train. If the robot was trained on data picking up one piece of bread\u2014say, a deli roll\u2014it can generalize that information to pick up a piece of ciabatta in a new environment. </p><h2>A Scalable Solution</h2><p>In addition to EgoZero, the research group is working on several projects to help make general-purpose robots a reality, including open-source robot designs, flexible <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08276\" target=\"_blank\">touch sensors</a>, and additional methods of collecting real-world training data. </p><p>For example, as an alternative to EgoZero, the researchers have also designed a setup with a 3D-printed handheld gripper that more closely resembles most robot \u201chands.\u201d A smartphone attached to the gripper captures video with the same point-space method that\u2019s used in EgoZero. The team, by having people collect data without bringing a robot into their homes, provide two approaches that could be more scalable for collecting training data.</p><p>That scalability is ultimately the researcher\u2019s goal. Large language models can harness the entire Internet, but there is no Internet equivalent for the physical world. Tapping into everyday interactions with smart glasses could help fill that gap.</p>"
