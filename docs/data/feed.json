Our analysis reveals three key findings. First, China\u2019s policymaking has historically been highly decentralized, with local bureaucrats playing crucial roles in both creating new policies and spreading them. Second, since 2013, policymaking has become substantially more centralized, driven primarily by changing bureaucratic incentives\u2014bottom-up innovation is no longer rewarded, while strict enforcement of central policies is. Third, our examination of industrial policies shows that centralization affects both policy suitability and effectiveness. Top-down industrial policies tend to align poorly with local conditions and are less effective at driving industrial growth, highlighting centralization\u2019s costs. On the other hand, under decentralization, competition among local officials can distort policy diffusion, also undermining effectiveness. Our quantitative assessment of both distortions indicates that economic costs of centralizing policymaking in China have significantly outweighed its benefits."

        "summary": "This chapter explores the distinctive trajectory of American industrialization up to 1870, emphasizing how the United States adapted and transformed British technologies to suit its unique economic and resource conditions. Rather than a straightforward transfer of innovations, the chapter argues that American industrial development was shaped by path-dependent processes and historical contingencies\u2014such as the Embargo Act of 1807 and government sponsorship of firearms production\u2014that enabled the emergence of a domestic innovation ecosystem. The chapter offers fresh insights into how high-pressure steam engines, vertically integrated textile mills, and precision manufacturing techniques evolved in response to labor scarcity, capital constraints, and abundant natural resources. A particularly novel contribution is the detailed analysis of how American manufacturers substituted mechanization and organizational innovation for skilled labor, leading to the development of technologies that were not only distinct from their British counterparts but also foundational for the Second Industrial Revolution. The chapter also highlights the democratization of invention, showing how economic incentives and institutional support fostered widespread innovation among ordinary citizens. By integrating technological, economic, and institutional perspectives, this chapter provides a compelling explanation for why the United States developed a robust manufacturing sector despite seemingly unfavorable initial conditions."

Applying it to the U.S. patent examination process, we find that, ceteris paribus, applications from female inventors are 1.8 percentage points less likely to be approved, and those from Black inventors are 3 percentage points less likely\u2014inconsistent with legally prescribed criteria. Jointly studying multiple bias dimensions and their intersections for the first time, we uncover new biases, including an affiliation bias\u2014individual inventors are disadvantaged by 6.6 percentage points relative to employees of large, public firms, a disparity larger than any demographic gap. Moreover, innovation quality, location, and other factors can mitigate or compound discrimination, and the disparities interact: for example, racial gaps vanish among public-firm employees, masking more severe discrimination against individuals. Existing theories such as homophily cannot fully explain the results, but a simple model of correlation neglect does."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve partially \"looked through\" the post-Covid rise in inflation and ultimately managed to bring about an \"immaculate disinflation.\" The Fed's policy deviated strongly from the Taylor rule during this period. More generally, central banks with strong inflation-fighting credentials looked through post-Covid inflationary shocks yet experienced less inflation than more hawkish but less credible central banks. In light of this episode, we assess the degree to which the Taylor rule is descriptive, and the degree to which it should be viewed as prescriptive. While the Taylor rule (generally) fits well during the Greenspan period, it (generally) fits poorly in the early 1980s and after the early 2000s. Academic work has emphasized the role of the Taylor rule in preventing self-fulfilling fluctuations (guaranteeing determinacy). These concerns can be addressed with a shock-contingent commitment and are fragile to deviations from fully rational expectations. We discuss three reasons why optimal policy may not always imply a one-for-one response of interest rates to inflation (forward guidance, correlated shocks, and \"long and variable lags\"). The main challenge arising from such policies is not indeterminacy but erosion of inflation-fighting credibility and potential deanchoring of long-run inflation expectations. Only central banks with strongly anchored inflation expectations and large amounts of inflation-fighting credibility are likely to be able to look through inflationary shocks."

We study the scaling of a personalized adaptive learning (PAL) software that was highly effective in a small-scale trial. We adapt the PAL implementation for scalability by integrating it into public school schedules, and experimentally evaluate this adaptation in a more representative sample over 20 times larger than the original study. After 18 months, treated students scored 0.22\u03c3 higher in Mathematics and 0.20\u03c3 higher in Hindi, a 50\u201366% productivity increase over the control group. Learning gains were proportional to student time on the platform, providing a simple, low-cost metric for monitoring implementation quality in future scale-ups. The adaptation was cost effective, and its key design features make it widely scalable across diverse settings."

While the United States has remained a leading destination for international students, recent years have seen a plateau or decline in incoming students, contrasted by growth in countries like Canada, Australia, and emerging hubs such as China and India. International students, particularly in STEM fields, play a critical role in shaping host countries' innovation ecosystems, often transitioning to permanent residents and STEM workers. We review immigration policies, including post-graduation work and residency pathways, highlighting their varying impacts on student inflows and innovation. Policies in Canada and Australia have until recently eased these transitions, while restrictive measures in the U.S. and U.K. have posed challenges. By documenting these trends and policy shifts, we identify gaps in the literature and outline directions for future research at the intersection of international education, immigration, and innovation."

We study this question in the context of Brazilian agriculture and the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu\u00e1ria (Embrapa), a public research corporation established in 1973 to develop locally suitable science and technology. First, we show that Embrapa redirected research toward prioritized staple crops and local ecological conditions, and increased research productivity, especially in remote and research-scarce regions. Second, exploiting the staggered rollout of research centers alongside heterogeneous local exposure to Embrapa\u2019s technology development, we find that Embrapa significantly increased agricultural output, driven both by higher productivity and expanded input use. Combined with a model, these estimates imply that public R&amp;D investment increased national agricultural productivity by 110% with a benefit-cost ratio of 17. The decentralized structure, in which research labs were spread across many ecological zones instead of in a single hub, explains a large share of these benefits."

        "summary": "How does being over- or underqualified at the beginning of a worker's career affect skill acquisition, retention, and promotion? Despite the importance of mismatch for the labor market, self-selection into jobs has made estimating these effects difficult. We overcome endogeneity concerns in the context of the US Air Force, which allocates new enlistees to over 130 different jobs based, in part, on test scores. Using these test scores, we create simulated job assignments based on factors outside of an individual's control: the available slots in upcoming training programs and the quality of other recruits entering at the same time. These factors create quasi-random variation in job assignment and hence how cognitively demanding an individual's job is relative to their own ability. We find that being overqualified for a job causes higher attrition, both during technical training and afterward when individuals are working in their assigned jobs. It also results in more behavioral problems, worse performance evaluations, and lower scores on general knowledge tests about the military taken by all workers. On the other hand, overqualification results in better performance relative to others in the same job: job-specific test scores rise both during technical training and while on the job, and these individuals are more likely to be promoted. Combined, these patterns suggest that overqualified individuals are less motivated, but still outperform others in their same job. Underqualification results in a polar opposite set of findings, suggesting these individuals are motivated to put forth more effort, but still struggle to compete when judged relative to others. Consistent with differential incentives, individuals who are overqualified are in jobs which are less valuable in terms of outside earnings potential, while the reverse is true for those who are underqualified."

        "summary": "This paper uses labor force surveys from 160 countries to build a new microdatabase on hours worked covering 97% of the world population in cross section. We also construct time series spanning over 20 years in 86 countries. Hours worked per adult are slightly bell-shaped with GDP per capita but weakly correlated with development overall. Hours worked by the young (aged 15-19) and elderly (aged 60+) decline with development, driven by growing school attendance and public pension coverage. Hours worked among prime-age adults (aged 20-59) are mildly bell-shaped with development for men while they are increasing for women. The fall in male hours in middle-to-higher income countries is driven by reduced hours per worker and is offset by increases in female labor force participation. These two forces have exactly compensated each other in many countries, leading to a remarkable long-run stability of prime-age hours worked. Labor taxes are strongly negatively correlated with prime-age hours worked both in international comparisons and overtime within countries. Controlling for government transfers only partly reduces the link between labor taxes and prime-age hours, ruling out substitution and income effects on labor supply as the only driver. Controlling for working hours regulations and the size of the formal sector eliminates this link, suggesting that regulations also play a large role in reducing intensive hours in higher-income countries."

        "summary": "College loans serve as a double-edged sword for human capital investment: While they facilitate access to education, the burden of repayment may distort post-education investments in human capital. We examine the role of college loans and loan repayment policies through a structural model in which heterogeneous individuals, faced with borrowing limits, make dynamic decisions on consumption, borrowing/saving, labor supply, and costly human capital investment (via both college education and on-the-job learning a la Ben-Porath (1967)). We estimate two versions of the model using data from the NLSY79: one with natural borrowing limits and another with parameterized limits. Counterfactual simulations based on both models suggest that, relative to the standard fixed repayment plan, income-driven repayment (IDR) plans modestly increase educational attainment, lifetime earnings, and individual welfare. Although some generous IDR plans may result in losses for the loan program itself, overall government revenue is higher under IDRs than under the standard repayment plan when lifetime income taxes are accounted for, creating a win-win scenario for both individual welfare and government revenue."

        "summary": "For large classes of potential inventions, intellectual property rights that are available on paper are either not possible or not profitable for firms to enforce in practice. In this paper, we show that these missing incentives yield quantitatively significant underinvestment in research and development. We develop a simple model that formalizes the conditions under which such missing markets for innovation arise. We identify an empirical setting\u2014research into new uses for existing drugs\u2014in which there is sharp variation in the enforceability of intellectual property rights on otherwise comparable inventions over time. We show that when intellectual property rights become unenforceable, research investment and commercialization nearly cease. In doing so, we test two claims central both to our model and the innovation literature more generally\u2014that stronger intellectual property protection does, in fact, induce investment, and that heterogeneity in the availability of these rights distorts investment. The welfare consequences of inadequate incentives in our empirical context are large. Our estimates suggest that 200-800 new uses for existing drugs would have been developed under counterfactual policies. Measures of the value of these uses drawn from existing literature suggest that the social cost of this particular missing market is on the order of several trillion dollars."

And these are just three of the largest companies in an increasingly crowded space.</p><p>Amplifying this message are many financial analysts: <a href=\"https://institute.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/transformation/humanoid-robots.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America Global Research</a>, for example, predicts that global humanoid robot shipments will reach 18,000 units in 2025. And <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/humanoid-robot-market-5-trillion-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley Research estimates</a> that by 2050 there could be over 1 billion humanoid robots, part of a US $5 trillion market.</p><p>But as of now, the market for humanoid robots is almost entirely hypothetical. Even the most successful companies in this space have deployed only a small handful of robots in carefully controlled pilot projects. And future projections seem to be based on an extraordinarily broad interpretation of jobs that a capable, efficient, and safe humanoid robot\u2014which does not currently exist\u2014might conceivably be able to do. Can the current reality connect with the promised scale?</p><h2>What Will It Take to Scale Humanoid Robots?</h2><p>Physically building tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of humanoid robots, is certainly possible in the near term. In 2023, <a href=\"https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/record-of-4-million-robots-working-in-factories-worldwide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on the order of 500,000 industrial robots were installed worldwide</a>. Under the basic assumption that a humanoid robot is approximately equivalent to four industrial arms in terms of components, existing supply chains should be able to support even the most optimistic near-term projections for humanoid manufacturing.</p><p>But simply building the robots is arguably the easiest part of scaling humanoids, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meloneewise/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Melonee Wise</a>, who served as chief product officer at Agility Robotics until this month. \u201cThe bigger problem is demand\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone has found an application for humanoids that would require several thousand robots per facility.\u201d Large deployments, Wise explains, are the most realistic way for a robotics company to scale its business, since onboarding any new client can take weeks or months. An alternative approach to deploying several thousand robots to do a single job is to deploy several hundred robots that can each do 10 jobs, which seems to be what most of the humanoid industry is betting on in the medium to long term.</p><p>While there\u2019s a belief across much of the humanoid robotics industry that rapid progress in AI must somehow translate into rapid progress toward multipurpose robots, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/solve-robotics\" target=\"_self\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfvctjoMPk8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clear</a> how, when, or if that will happen. \u201cI think what a lot of people are hoping for is they\u2019re going to AI their way out of this,\u201d says Wise. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is that currently AI is not robust enough to meet the requirements of the market.\u201d</p><h2>Bringing Humanoid Robots to Market</h2><p><span>Market requirements for humanoid robots include a slew of extremely dull, extremely critical things like battery life, reliability, and safety. Of these, battery life is the most straightforward\u2014for a robot to usefully do a job, it can\u2019t spend most of its time charging. The next version of Agility\u2019s Digit robot, which can handle payloads of up to 16 kilograms, includes a bulky \u201cbackpack\u201d containing a battery with a charging ratio of 10 to 1: The robot can run for 90 minutes, and fully recharge in 9 minutes. Slimmer humanoid robots from other companies must necessarily be making compromises to maintain their svelte form factors.</span></p><p>In operation, Digit will probably spend a few minutes charging after running for 30 minutes. That\u2019s because 60 minutes of Digit\u2019s runtime is essentially a reserve in case something happens in its workspace that requires it to temporarily pause, a not-infrequent occurrence in the logistics and manufacturing environments that Agility is targeting. Without a 60-minute reserve, the robot would be much more likely to run out of power mid-task and need to be manually recharged. Consider what that might look like with even a modest deployment of several hundred robots weighing over a hundred kilograms each. \u201cNo one wants to deal with that,\u201d comments Wise.</p><p>Potential customers for humanoid robots are very concerned with downtime. Over the course of a month, a factory operating at 99 percent reliability will see approximately 5 hours of downtime. Wise says that any downtime that stops something like a production line can cost tens of thousands of dollars per minute, which is why many industrial customers expect a couple more 9s of reliability: 99.99 percent. Wise says that Agility has demonstrated this level of reliability in some specific applications, but not in the context of multipurpose or general-purpose functionality.</p><h2>Humanoid Robot Safety</h2><p><span>A humanoid robot in an industrial environment must meet general </span><a href=\"https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/ansi-b11-standards-safety-of-machinery/\" target=\"_blank\">safety</a><span> </span><a href=\"https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2006-42-ec-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a><span> for industrial machines. In the past, robotic systems like autonomous vehicles and drones have benefited from immature regulatory environments to scale quickly. But Wise says that approach can\u2019t work for humanoids, because the industry is already heavily regulated\u2014the robot is simply considered another piece of machinery.</span></p><p>There are also more specific<a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ria/ansiriar15082020\" target=\"_blank\"> safety standards</a> currently under development for humanoid robots, explains Matt Powers, associate director of autonomy R&amp;D at Boston Dynamics. He notes that his company is helping develop an <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/91469.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) safety standard for dynamically balancing legged robots</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that the top players in the field, like Agility and Figure, are joining us in developing a way to explain why we believe that the systems that we\u2019re deploying are safe,\u201d Powers says.</p><p>These standards are necessary because the traditional safety approach of cutting power may not be a good option for a dynamically balancing system. Doing so will cause a humanoid robot to fall over, potentially making the situation even worse. There is no simple solution to this problem, and the initial approach that Boston Dynamics expects to take with its Atlas robot is to keep the robot out of situations where simply powering it off might not be the best option. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with relatively low-risk deployments, and then expand as we build confidence in our safety systems,\u201d Powers says. \u201cI think a methodical approach is really going to be the winner here.\u201d</p><p>In practice, low risk means keeping humanoid robots away from people. But humanoids that are restricted by what jobs they can safely do and where they can safely move are going to have more trouble finding tasks that provide value.</p><h2>Are Humanoids the Answer?</h2><p><span>The issues of demand, battery life, reliability, and safety all need to be solved before humanoid robots can scale. But a more fundamental question to ask is whether a bipedal robot is actually worth the trouble.</span></p><p>Dynamic balancing with legs would theoretically enable these robots to navigate complex environments like a human. Yet demo videos show these humanoid robots as either mostly stationary or repetitively moving short distances over flat floors. The promise is that what we\u2019re seeing now is just the first step toward humanlike mobility. But in the short to medium term, there are much more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective platforms that can take over in these situations: robots with arms, but with wheels instead of legs.</p><p>Safe and reliable humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize the labor market at some point in the future. But potential is just that, and despite the humanoid enthusiasm, we have to be realistic about what it will take to turn potential into reality. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cWhy Humanoid Robots Aren\u2019t Scaling.\u201d</em></p>"

In an accusatory <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Natcast-CEO-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to Natcast CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/deirdre-hanford/\" target=\"_blank\">Deirdre Hanford </a>and a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/department-commerce-takes-action-against-biden-administrations\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, Lutnick claimed the nonprofit was not created legally, and said that the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/chips\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> would be taking over NSTC operations.</p><p><span>The Commerce Department has been suppressing Natcast\u2019s operations for many months, </span><em>IEEE Spectrum</em><span> has learned. According to multiple sources, the organization\u2019s research agenda was completed in April and should have been accepted and processed by Commerce in a matter of weeks. But it never happened. A memo selecting awardees for research into </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/prism\" target=\"_blank\">reducing the impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from semiconductor manufacturing</a><span> was submitted to Commerce but never approved. Three groups won parts of a </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-finalizes-aidrfic-research-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">$30 million grant to transform the design of RF chips using machine learning</a><span>, but at least one awardee has gotten no word on when or whether the funding will flow.</span></p><p>\u201cThis is a sad end,\u201d said one person who requested anonymity and was involved in early debate about the NSTC. </p><p>Lutnick\u2019s characterization of Natcast\u2019s creation as cronyism \u201cis pretty frustrating,\u201d this person continued. The idea that NSTC would be operated by an independent public-private partnership, which is written into the law, came from deep consultation with industry and was intended to insulate its work from politics. The organization needed such protection to make good technical decisions, because in selecting who gets funds \u201cthere are always more losers than winners,\u201d this person said.</p><p>Over the past week, Natcast has been defending itself and its staff against Lutnick\u2019s accusations. On 4 September, in a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-member-letter-regarding-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">letter to its 200 members</a>, Hanford countered Lutnick\u2019s assertions that the organization was packed with Biden administration cronies and that it was run as a \u201cslush fund.\u201d Hanford pointed to the multiple layers of government and industry oversight Natcast operates under and the experienced semiconductor industry staff it has brought on. She added that the nonprofit had stuck to its agreements with the government, submitting 119 \u201cmilestones and deliverables\u201d to Commerce.</p><h2>What\u2019s Lost Without Natcast</h2><p>On 8 September, Natcast published a detailed <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-assets-supporting-the-continued-mission-of-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">overview of what it has done so far</a>. Accomplishments included creating an industry-driven R&amp;D agenda, the development of multiple workforce programs, and the signing on of some 200 members. These members included cutting-edge logic and memory companies (such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skhynix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SK Hynix</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona\" target=\"_self\">TSMC</a>), small companies like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/atomera-plans-to-breathe-new-life-into-older-chip-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">Atomera</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=encharge+ai\" target=\"_self\">EnCharge AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">Polar Semiconductor</a>, and multiple universities and makers of semiconductor tools and equipment.</p><p><a href=\"https://natcast.org/nstcmembership/members\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a> had the right to use facilities and other infrastructure that Natcast was standing up (for a fee) and participate in research. One goal for the infrastructure was to reduce the time from concept to prototype by 30 percent. Access to the tools and processes NSTC would provide is out of reach for even some of the country\u2019s top researchers, <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s source said. Without that access, startups and researchers won\u2019t be able to afford to do relevant work using 300-millimeter wafers and advanced chip-technology nodes. Despite the fact that not all of its facilities were complete, Natcast had plans to proceed with research by chaining together existing infrastructure around the country.</p><p>In addition, the document from 8 September detailed the expert in-house team at Natcast, and said that expertise allowed it to evaluate R&amp;D awards at twice the rate of federal agencies while requiring considerably less overhead than government, universities, and non-profit research organizations like Imec. (It forecast a 10 percent overhead on expenses over 10 years.)</p><p>\u201cNatcast was supposed to do what industry couldn\u2019t solve by itself,\u201d said a source familiar with the situation. Its R&amp;D program was aimed at solving big problems, such as collapsing the time and energy required to <a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/smap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">move data between memory and computing</a>, in a way that the whole industry could benefit from.<span></span></p>"

These days, however, blockchain is most famous as the tool enabling <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money?utm_campaign=post-teaser&amp;utm_content=ibfuflhf\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies</a>. Most recently</span><span>, the Trump administration has </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/business/bitcoin-crypto-rally-us-stocks\" target=\"_blank\">taken</a><span> on a pro-cryptocurrency stance, boosting blockchain\u2019s </span>popularity and media prominence.</p><p><span>Cryptography is central to the functioning of blockchains, whether for a decentralized Web or for cryptocurrencies. Every time a cryptocurrency transaction is initiated, all parties involved in the transaction need to securely prove that they agree to the transfer. This is done via a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\" target=\"_blank\">digital signature</a>: a cryptographic protocol that generates a secret, private key that is unique to each user and a public key that the user shares. Then, the private key is used to generate a unique signature for each transaction. The public key can be used to verify that, indeed, the signature was created by the holder of the private key. In this way, Web3 in every incarnation relies heavily on cryptography. </span></p><p><span>To learn more about the evolution of Web3, and cryptography\u2019s role, we caught up with</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://wahby.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Riad Wahby</a><span>, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, and a cofounder and CEO of hardware-backed Web3 security platform </span><a href=\"https://cubist.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Cubist</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> Wahby explained what Web3 was meant to be, what it\u2019s become, and how hardware-backed cryptography will enable its future.<br /></span></p><h3>Web3 Began as a Response to What Came Before</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: What is Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Riad Wahby:</strong> That\u2019s the hardest question that you\u2019re going to ask by far, because I don\u2019t know how to answer it in a way that satisfies everyone.</p><p>The term Web3 was coined around 2014, by people who looked at the way that the Web had developed. Web 1.0 was the first Web bubble, the dot-com bubble. Web 2.0, roughly speaking, is Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Apple and Netflix, and the like. And the perception, especially from folks who originally coined this term Web3, was that these companies had basically taken the Web in the wrong direction, because your privacy is gone, and you\u2019re the product, so to speak. You use Gmail for free because Google is mining your emails to sell things like better advertising. Web3 was originally a reaction to this. Early proponents of Web3 basically said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We want to take back control of our stuff. I want to own my own data, and maybe cryptocurrencies and blockchains are the way there.\u201d So that\u2019s where the term originally came from.</p><p><strong>What does the term mean now?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Now it doesn\u2019t mean anything like that at all. Now Web3 is the broader ecosystem around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. And I think basically all of that revolutionary spirit has gone away in favor of building financial products and making a lot of money doing it. As far as I can tell, the term has really transformed from a reaction to a lack of privacy and a lack of sovereignty in my own data to \u201cHey, this is a technology that has something to do with blockchains.\u201d Maybe you can buy some kind of speculative meme coin and make a bunch of money doing it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe that took a dark turn at the end. That\u2019s how things go.</p><p><strong>How are those two definitions connected?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Cryptography really fits into the revolutionary spirit, in the sense that the folks who want to cast off the chains of things like Google and Facebook, one of the tenets was\u2014\u201dThe way that we\u2019ll do that is we\u2019ll build this technology that\u2019s sort of amazing and that gives us all these great properties.\u201d And they were going to do that using some advanced cryptographic technologies. This is the reason that there\u2019s so many people who are cryptography researchers at universities that also are involved deeply in some kind of cryptocurrency. Because it\u2019s like this is a sea change in the way that cryptography gets used in the world.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it used to be that if you were working on really any kind of cryptography, regardless of how theoretical or how practical you intended it to be, you knew that there was not much of a chance that any of it was going to get really used in the world, unless it was extremely practical and extremely focused on solving some immediate problem. And it just used to be the case that people were extremely conservative about what kind of cryptography they used. Basically, everyone thought, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of this crazy stuff. That\u2019s all theory. Nobody cares. The only stuff we need is what lets you connect to Amazon and safely buy stuff.\u201d The rise of cryptocurrencies brought with it this whole shift in the way that cryptography gets deployed in the world, where now if you can come up with some interesting functionality that\u2019s enabled by some advanced cryptography, probably somewhere somebody is going to try and turn that into a product that they can sell.</p><h3>Web3 Is Both Good and Bad for Cryptography</h3><p><strong>What effect has this had on the cryptographic community?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> It\u2019s both good and bad. It\u2019s good in that this means that there\u2019s a lot of motivation to build interesting, cool stuff. And as a researcher in cryptography, I love it because it means that there\u2019s tons more research money being poured into cryptography.</p><p>That\u2019s the good side. The bad side is that the reason that people were so conservative about deploying new cryptography is that it\u2019s easy to get the security mechanism wrong. The default state of cryptography is [to assume everything is] broken. You have to be very, very careful that each change that you make isn\u2019t returning your cryptography to the default state. I\u2019m not saying that people in Web3 aren\u2019t careful. They are. It\u2019s just by the nature of things, since it\u2019s a much faster time frame, there\u2019s much more pressure to just push stuff into production. And I think the downside is that we have seen a little bit of brokenness. It\u2019s hopefully not causing people to lose oodles of money. And I think the historical record bears this out: People lose oodles of money because other people are really dishonest, not because the cryptography is broken for the most part. But the cryptography can also be broken, and that can also be worrisome. But I\u2019d say from the perspective of somebody who\u2019s doing research in cryptography, the impact of Web3 on the cryptographic community has generally been a good thing.</p><p><strong>Now you\u2019re focused on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip\" target=\"_blank\">hardware security</a>. Can you explain what that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Any cryptocurrency has this property that if I hold some token, and I want to send it to somebody else, the way that I do that is by producing a digital signature that says, I want to spend this token. The secret key is what lets you generate a signature. So if you have 10 <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-merge-heralds-cryptos-climate-friendly-future\" target=\"_blank\">E</a>TH [cryptocurrency coins], and they\u2019re all protected by this key, and somebody takes a copy of your key, then life is bad.</p><p>With a digital signature key it could just be sitting on your hard drive, and then you get some malware, and now somebody has silently stolen your key. There have been these big, broadly targeted malware campaigns where millions and millions of people have all had their keys stolen. So now the criminals are just like sitting there counting up all the money that they\u2019ve stolen, and there\u2019s no reversing transactions, unlike at a bank.</p><p>Here\u2019s where hardware comes in. This is not really a Web3 technology, this is kind of old, good stuff. There are these devices called hardware security modules, and they\u2019ve been used for multiple decades. This is a physical device, and this device can run certain cryptographic algorithms. And it knows enough that when you tell it, \u201cHey, please generate me a key,\u201d it can generate you a key securely. And when you tell it, \u201cPlease give me a signature,\u201d it can give you a signature securely. But the important thing is the way that it\u2019s designed, the key never leaves this piece of hardware. It turns what was a piece of data into a physical object. And we know how to secure a physical object.</p><p><strong>You\u2019re working on extending hardware security for more use cases. Can you explain what you\u2019re doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> There are two issues with the standard hardware security module.</p><p>No. 1, you need more cryptography support, so you need to be able to apply digital signatures to transactions very quickly if you\u2019re actively trading. And No. 2, you need a way of expressing that it\u2019s not just a key that can generate any signature. It\u2019s a key that also has attached to it some kind of policy that says these are the kinds of signatures that are okay to generate, and everything else is not allowed, to add extra security. These are the two directions that we have that our technology enables within traditional hardware security modules.</p><p>We start with the security that\u2019s provided by the traditional hardware security module, and we extend it using this, actually another piece of trusted hardware called the Trusted Execution Environment. We extend it to support the actual kinds of cryptography that are needed for Web3 and to support this rich programmable policy layer that lets you say, \u201cThis key is only intended for this specific kind of use,\u201d or \u201canytime somebody tries to make a payment from this key, first I have to check whether the recipient is subject to sanctions,\u201d or any other rule. So in the end, we have, not only a hardware security module, we have also this Trusted Execution Environment and this policy layer, and all this other cryptographic stuff that together gives us a hardware security module that\u2019s really designed for the Web3 use case.</p>"

Usually, they want to write an article for us. But one bold query I received in January 2024 went much further: An undergraduate engineering student named <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatosin-kolade/?originalSubdomain=ng\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oluwatosin Kolade</a>, from Obafemi Awolowo University, in Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300, Nigeria, volunteered to be our robotics editor. </p><p>Kolade\u2014Tosin to his friends\u2014had been the newsletter editor for his IEEE student branch, but he\u2019d never published an article professionally. His earnestness and enthusiasm were endearing. I explained that we already have a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/evan-ackerman\" target=\"_self\">robotics editor</a>, but I\u2019d be glad to work with him on writing, editing, and ultimately publishing an article. </p><p> Back in 2003, I had met plenty of engineering students when I traveled to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\">Nigeria to report </a>on the SAT-3/WASC cable, the first undersea fiber-optic cable to land in West Africa. I remember seeing students gathering around obsolete PCs at Internet caf\u00e9s connected to the world via a satellite dish powered by a generator. I challenged Tosin to tell <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> readers what it\u2019s like for engineering students today. The result is \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Lessons from a Janky Drone</a>.\u201d</p><p>I decided to complement Tosin\u2019s piece with the perspective of a more established engineer in sub-Saharan Africa. I reached out to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/g-pascal-zachary\" target=\"_self\">G. Pascal Zachary</a>, who has covered engineering education in Africa for us, and Zachary introduced me to <a href=\"https://ibaino.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Engineer Bainomugisha</a>, a computer science professor at Makerere University, in Kampala, Uganda. In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/africa-engineering-hardware\" target=\"_blank\">Learning More With Less</a>,\u201d Bainomugisha draws out the things that were common to his and Tosin\u2019s experience and suggests ways to make the hardware necessary for engineering education more accessible.</p><p>In fact, the region\u2019s decades-long struggle to develop its engineering talent hinges on access to the three things we focus on in this issue: reliable electricity, ubiquitous broadband, and educational resources for young engineers.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cDuring my weekly video calls with Tosin...the connection was pretty good\u2014 except when it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p><span>Zachary\u2019s article in this issue, \u201c</span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electricity-access-sub-saharan-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What It Will Really Take to Electrify All of Africa</a><span>\u201d</span><span> tackles the first topic, with a focus on an ambitious initiative to bring electricity to an additional 300 million people by 2030.</span></p><p> Contributing editor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/lucas-laursen\" target=\"_self\">Lucas Laursen</a>\u2019s article, \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/broadband-internet-in-nigeria\" target=\"_blank\">In Nigeria, Why Isn\u2019t Broadband Everywhere?</a>\u201d investigates the slow rollout of fiber-optic connectivity in the two decades since my first visit. As he learned when he traveled to Nigeria earlier this year, the country now has eight undersea cables delivering 380 terabits of capacity, yet less than half of the population has broadband access. </p><p>I got a sense of Nigeria\u2019s bandwidth issues during my weekly video calls with Tosin to discuss his article. The connection was pretty good, except when it wasn\u2019t. Still, I reminded myself, two decades ago such calls would have been nearly impossible. </p><p>Through those weekly chats, we established a professional connection, which made it that much more meaningful when I got to meet Tosin in person this past May at the <a href=\"https://2025.ieee-icra.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE ICRA robotics conference</a>, in Atlanta. Tosin was attending thanks to a scholarship from the <a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</a>. Like a kid in a candy shop, he kibbutzed with fellow scholarship winners, attended talks, checked out robots, and met the engineers who built them. </p><p>As Tosin embarks on the next leg in his career journey, he is supported by the IEEE community, which not only recognizes his promise but gives him access to a network of professionals who can help him and his cohort realize their potential.</p>"

Instead, it handed operational control to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p><p><a href=\"https://natcast.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Natcast</a> was created in 2023 to oversee the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), which the law established to conduct \u201cresearch and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology and grow the domestic semiconductor workforce to strengthen the economic competitiveness and security of the domestic supply chain.\u201d </p><p>The nonprofit was contracted to receive a total of US $7.4 billion in annual payments and when the organization reaches milestones. But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lutnick\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> claimed that Natcast doesn\u2019t meet certain legal requirements, and therefore the contract, inked less than a week before Donald J. Trump took office for the second time, is illegal. </p><p>Several NSTC proponents whom <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> spoke to are concerned that the move could squander U.S. semiconductor leadership in the long term. The goal of the NSTC, those involved say, is to make gains in semiconductors from the CHIPS Act durable through continued advances. </p><h2>Semiconductor Workforce Development</h2><p>Since its establishment, Natcast has been working to bring up three <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nstc\" target=\"_self\">key centers to execute those functions</a>. In Silicon Valley, it\u2019s established a workforce-development and design-enablement center. In New York, it opened a center for<a href=\"https://natcast.org/grand-opening-nstc-euv-accelerator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> extreme-ultraviolet lithography for cutting-edge chipmaking</a>. And in Arizona, it plans to build a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/third-chips-for-america-rd-flagship-facility-announced\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">prototyping and packaging facility</a>. The centers are intended to help startups and other companies more easily bridge the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">lab-to-fab gap</a> that currently prevents new technologies from making it into commercial products.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThere were people from day one\u2026who viewed [Natcast] as very much a political entity and wanted to undo it.\u201d </p><p>The CHIPS Act requires that the NSTC be operated as a \u201cpublic private-sector consortium with participation from the private sector\u201d instead of by a government agency. During the Biden administration, the Commerce Department created Natcast to fill that role, deliberately setting it up in a way to help maintain its independence from political interference. </p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Natcast-CEO-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public letter</a> to Natcast CEO <a href=\"https://natcast.org/deirdre-hanford-ceo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deirdre Hanford</a>, Lutnick cast the actions of Hanford, her staff, and the volunteer advisors involved in the organization\u2019s creation as giving \u201cthe appearance of impropriety\u201d and flouting \u201cfederal law.\u201d \u201cFrom the very beginning Natcast served as a semiconductor slush fund that did nothing but line the pockets of Biden loyalists with American tax dollars,\u201d he said in a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/department-commerce-takes-action-against-biden-administrations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>.</p><p><em><em>Spectrum</em></em> sought additional comment from the Commerce Department and from Natcast but did not receive a reply by press time.</p><p>Very little funding has actually been delivered, sources say, in part because Commerce has held up its dispersal. (Despite this, NSTC does have a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jay-lewis-1108361_natcast-nist-natcast-activity-7362847657897205761-tEE3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAolpgBG1d7OiKsbIW43dxd6SSv0dyPEgA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of accomplishments</a>.) Lutnick\u2019s legal argument for refusing payment now is that Natcast wasn\u2019t established in accordance with the Government Corporation Control Act, which lays out how government agencies establish or purchase corporations. </p><p>One person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named says that the structure of Natcast is typical of public\u2013private partnerships and that its underpinnings were thoroughly reviewed by the Commerce Department before its establishment. What\u2019s really at issue, this person says, is Natcast\u2019s independence.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhat was set up\u2026was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026. I think all of that has gone away with this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were people from day one\u2026who viewed [Natcast] as very much a political entity and wanted to undo it,\u201d says this person.</p><p>In the letter, Lutnick takes aim at <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipient/deirdre-hanford/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hanford</a>, formerly a top executive at electronic design automation giant <a href=\"https://www.synopsys.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Synopsys</a>, as well as at Natcast staffers who came over from government during the Biden administration or from a volunteer <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/09/us-department-commerce-appoints-first-members-industrial-advisory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industrial advisory committee</a> that included IEEE Fellows and other chip-industry leaders. Targeting such people is concerning, says one expert who preferred not to be named, because chip experts who choose to work in government or at Natcast are usually giving up more lucrative work to serve their country. It has the effect of \u201cpunishing patriotic behavior,\u201d the expert said.</p><p>Delaying the work of the NSTC by attacking Natcast is counterproductive for the U.S. chip industry, the expert added. \u201cWe are in a race, and these delays make it all the more urgent.\u201d</p><p>Commerce will likely find some way to spend the money on semiconductor R&amp;D eventually, sources agreed. One expert told <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> they have faith in NIST\u2019s ability to administer the research funding. Mark Granahan, an early proponent of the CHIPS Act and CEO of<a href=\"https://idealsemi.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Ideal Semiconductor</a>, in Bethlehem, Penn., went further. \u201cIf the administration has a different tactic but the same goal\u2026 not just independence in semiconductors but leadership\u2026then NIST and other existing infrastructure is capable of handling things,\u201d he said.</p><p>But other sources were skeptical it would have the same impact as Natcast. \u201cWhat was set up\u2026was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind,\u201d said one person. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026. I think all of that has gone away with this decision.\u201d</p><p><em>This post was updated on 26 August 2025 to remove mention of NSTC\u2019s September Symposium, which is now canceled.</em></p>"

Then, after an encouraging review, my manager asked if I\u2019d start managing a team of my own. I had received strong performance ratings and earned trust among my colleagues and the leadership team, and the organization\u2019s headcount was consistently increasing each year.</span></p><p>This is the standard origin story for engineers who transition to management. But the skills required to succeed as an engineer and the ones a manager has to have are significantly different. Strong engineers succeed through rigorous analytical ability and deep work. Strong managers (whose work is decidedly un-analytical!) motivate and grow people\u2019s <span>careers</span>, while also being prepared to jump into issues at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p><span>The ideal motivation to become a manager is simple: </span><strong>You care about people</strong><span>. Management is inherently a people-oriented </span><span>job</span><span>, which means managers should grow their reports through positive and constructive feedback. A good manager cares about discovering each person\u2019s zone of genius and then assigning work that best matches that engineer\u2019s profile. The byproduct of this is the ability to scale impact, but that should not be the primary motive.</span></p><p><span>A common, yet misguided, reason to switch to management is to earn more money. At least within Big Tech companies, managers and ICs at the same level are paid the same amount. In fact, some companies deliberately pay their managers less, simply to discourage mercenary engineers who are optimizing for compensation rather than people.</span></p><p><span></span><span>However, there is nuance here that\u2019s worth calling out. At more senior levels, managers are promoted at faster rates compared to ICs. A manager\u2019s impact is largely derived from their influence in an org, which includes the number of people in their reporting chain. A director with 50 engineers in their org can effectively \u201cclaim credit\u201d for the people on their team.</span></p><p><span></span><span>On the other hand, an individual contributor at the director level must produce output that has a similar scale of impact to what the 50 engineers shipped. As you can imagine, this is much harder. IC promotions at these levels require a level of technical brilliance that is difficult to reliably reproduce.</span></p><p><span></span><span>Managers often get promoted as they accumulate more people under them. This process can happen through re-orgs or employee departures, not necessarily through the unique contributions of the manager. The result is that managers who stick around long enough will naturally grow their </span><span>careers</span><span>. Empirically, this is obvious in the data. At a company like Meta or Google, there are far more VP-level managers than there are IC engineers of the equivalent level.</span></p><p><span></span><span>In the long term, therefore, managers do earn more money than individual contributors. This is not necessarily wrong, but you should reflect on your incentives and determine what will make you fulfilled beyond the money.</span></p><p><span>I ended up saying yes to the management opportunity I was offered, and I\u2019m very glad I did. Like any <span><span>job</span></span>, there were parts that I loved and parts that I didn\u2019t, and I ended up switching back to the IC ladder within a year.</span></p><p><span>\u2014Rahul</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-budget-cuts-trump-staff\" target=\"_blank\">NASA Cut 4,000 Staff, Where Will They Go?</a></h3><p><span></span><span>The U.S. space agency is undergoing a large \u201creduction in force,\u201d which includes about 4,000 employees who have taken offers to leave their positions through a \u201cdeferred resignation program.\u201d Where will ex-NASA engineers go next, and what does it mean for future missions?</span></p><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nasa-budget-cuts-trump-staff\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What I Learned From a Janky Drone</a></h3><p><span>A Nigerian engineering student describes his experience as part of a pair of articles on engineering education in Africa, from the perspective of both a student and teacher. \u201cThey describe the challenges they face and what they see as the path forward for a continent brimming with aspiring engineers but woefully short on the resources necessary for a robust education,\u201d <em>IEEE Spectrum\u2019</em>s editor-in-chief Harry Goldstein writes in an accompanying note.</span><span></span></p><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.</span></p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-founders-prioritize-the-problem\" target=\"_blank\">Tech Founders Must Learn to Prioritize the Problem</a></h3><p>Taking innovative tech to market can be tricky for engineers coming from a research background.

A case in point, MLPerf, the bi-annual machine learning competition sometimes termed \u201cthe Olympics of AI,\u201d introduced three new benchmark tests, reflecting new directions in the field.</p><p>\u201cLately, it has been very difficult trying to follow what happens in the field,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-hodak/\" target=\"_blank\">Miro Hodak</a>, AMD engineer and MLPerf Inference working group co-chair. \u201cWe see that the models are becoming progressively larger, and in the last two rounds we have introduced the largest models we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>The chips that tackled these new benchmarks came from the usual suspects\u2014Nvidia, Arm, and Intel. Nvidia topped the charts, introducing its new <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/?ncid=no-ncid\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blackwell Ultra</a> GPU, packaged in a <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb300-nvl72/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GB300</a> rack-scale design. AMD put up a strong performance, introducing its latest <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi325x.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MI325X</a> GPUs. Intel proved that one can still do inference on CPUs with their <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/xeon.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xeon</a> submissions, but also entered the GPU game with an <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/workstations/b-series/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Arc Pro</a> submission.</p><h2>New Benchmarks</h2><p>Last round, MLPerf <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-inference\" target=\"_self\">introduced</a> its largest benchmark yet, a large language model based on Llama3.1-403B. This round, they topped themselves yet again, introducing a benchmark based on the Deepseek R1 671B model\u2014more than 1.5 times the number of parameters of the previous largest benchmark.</p><p>As a reasoning model, Deepseek R1 goes through several steps of chain-of-thought when approaching a query. This means much of the computation happens during inference then in normal LLM operation, making this benchmark even more challenging. Reasoning models are claimed to be the most accurate, making them the technique of choice for science, math, and complex programming queries.</p><p>In addition to the largest LLM benchmark yet, MLPerf also introduced the smallest, based on Llama3.1-8B. There is growing industry demand for low latency yet high-accuracy reasoning, explained Taran Iyengar, MLPerf Inference task force chair. Small LLMs can supply this, and are an excellent choice for tasks such as text summarization and edge applications.</p><p>This brings the total count of LLM-based benchmarks to a confusing four. They include the new, smallest Llama3.1-8B benchmark; a pre-existing Llama2-70B benchmark; last round\u2019s introduction of the Llama3.1-403B benchmark; and the largest, the new Deepseek R1 model. If nothing else, this signals LLMs are not going anywhere.</p><p>In addition to the myriad LLMs, this round of MLPerf inference included a new voice-to-text model, based on Whisper-large-v3. This benchmark is a response to the growing number of voice-enabled applications, be it smart devices or speech-based AI interfaces.</p><p>TheMLPerf Inference competition has two broad categories: \u201cclosed,\u201d which requires using the reference neural network model as-is without modifications, and \u201copen,\u201d where some modifications to the model are allowed. Within those, there are several subcategories related to how the tests are done and in what sort of infrastructure. We will focus on the \u201cclosed\u201d datacenter server results for the sake of sanity.</p><h2>Nvidia leads</h2><p>Surprising no one, the best performance per accelerator on each benchmark, at least in the \u2018server\u2019 category, was achieved by an Nvidia GPU-based system. Nvidia also unveiled the Blackwell Ultra, topping the charts in the two largest benchmarks: Lllama3.1-405B and DeepSeek R1 reasoning.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24996953/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p><a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-blackwell-ultra-for-the-era-of-ai-reasoning/#:~:text=vs.,-HGX%20H100&amp;text=Blackwell%20Ultra%20brings%20even%20more,processing%20millions%20of%20input%20tokens.\" target=\"_blank\">Blackwell Ultra</a> is a more powerful iteration of the Blackwell architecture, featuring significantly more memory capacity, double the acceleration for attention layers, 1.5x more AI compute, and faster memory and connectivity compared to the standard Blackwell. It is intended for the larger AI workloads, like the two benchmarks it was tested on.</p><p>In addition to the hardware improvements, director of accelerated computing products at Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davesalvator/\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Salvator</a> attributes the success of Blackwell Ultra to two key changes. First, the use of Nvidia\u2019s proprietary 4-bit floating point <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/number-representation\" target=\"_self\">number format</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvfp4-for-efficient-and-accurate-low-precision-inference/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NVFP4</a>. \u201cWe can deliver comparable accuracy to formats like BF16,\u201d Salvator says, while using a lot less computing power.</p><p>The second is so-called <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/latest/architecture/disagg_serving.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">disaggregated serving</a>. The idea behind disaggregated serving is that there are two main parts to the inference workload: prefill, where the query (\u201cPlease summarize this report.\u201d) and its entire context window (the report) are loaded into the LLM, and generation/decoding, where the output is actually calculated. These two stages have different requirements. While prefill is compute heavy, generation/decoding is much more dependent on memory bandwidth. Salvator says that by assigning different groups of GPUs to the two different stages, Nvidia achieves a performance gain of nearly 50 percent.</p><h2>AMD close behind</h2><p>AMD\u2019s newest accelerator chip, MI355X launched in July. The company offered results only in the \u201copen\u201d category where software modifications to the model are permitted. Like Blackwell Ultra, MI355x features 4-bit floating point support, as well as expanded high-bandwidth memory. The MI355X beat its predecessor, the MI325X, in the open Llama2.1-70B benchmark by a factor of 2.7, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahesh-balas/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mahesh Balasubramanian</a>, senior director of data center GPU product marketing at AMD.</p><p>AMD\u2019s \u201cclosed\u201d submissions included systems powered by AMD MI300X and MI325X GPUs. The more advanced MI325X computer performed similarly to those built with Nvidia H200s on the Lllama2-70b, the mixture of experts test, and image generation benchmarks.</p><p>This round also included the first hybrid submission, where both AMD MI300X and MI325X GPUs were used for the same inference task,the Llama2-70b benchmark. The use of hybrid GPUs is important, because new GPUs are coming at a <a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/03/19/nvidia-draws-gpu-system-roadmap-out-to-2028/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">yearly cadence</a>, and the older models, deployed en-masse, are not going anywhere. Being able to spread workloads between different kinds of GPUs is an essential step.</p><h2>Intel enters the GPU game</h2><p>In the past, Intel has remained steadfast that one does not need a GPU to do machine learning. Indeed, submissions using Intel\u2019s Xeon CPU still performed on par with the Nvidia L4 on the object detection benchmark but trailed on the recommender system benchmark.</p><p>This round, for the first time, an Intel GPU also made a showing. The <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/workstations/b-series/overview.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Arc Pro</a> was first released in 2022. The MLPerf submission featured a graphics card called the <a href=\"https://www.maxsun.com/products/intel-arc-pro-b60-dual-48g-turbo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MaxSun Intel Arc Pro B60 Dual 48G Turbo</a> , which contains two GPUs and 48 gigabytes of memory. The system performed on-par with Nvidia\u2019s L40S on the small LLM benchmark and trailed it on the Llama2-70b benchmark.</p>"

It also runs hot, literally: The data centers operating artificial intelligence (AI) models use large amounts of electricity and generate enormous heat. To keep servers from overheating, many facilities rely on cooling systems that use water.</p><p>AI data centers\u2019 water use comes in two forms. Beyond the water that cools the servers, data centers indirectly contribute to water use through the electricity generation needed to power their operations. That indirect use often makes up <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3724499\" target=\"_blank\">80 percent or more</a> of the overall water use.</p><p>Reducing AI\u2019s water footprint means tackling two very different issues\u2014what happens inside the data center walls, and what happens beyond them on the power grid.</p><h2>Direct Water Use: Local and Sometimes Stressful</h2><p>Just as human bodies cool themselves by sweating, data centers are often cooled by water evaporation\u2014a process that dissipates heat and results in water being lost to the atmosphere, and thus being counted as \u201cconsumed.\u201d In many cases, the water is drawn from the same municipal systems that supply homes and businesses.</p><p>While most major tech companies now disclose their direct water use,<a href=\"https://datacenter.uptimeinstitute.com/rs/711-RIA-145/images/2024.GlobalDataCenterSurvey.Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> not all data centers follow suit</a>, making the overall picture unclear. In recent reports, companies have estimated that between <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apples_Water_Strategy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">45 percent</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2024/09/19/how-data-centers-use-water-and-how-were-working-to-use-water-responsibly/\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent</a> of withdrawn water is consumed.</p><p>According to a recent report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the 2023 direct water consumption by data centers in the United States\u2014home to about <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/investing-in-the-rising-data-center-economy\" target=\"_blank\">40 percent of the world\u2019s data centers</a>\u2014is estimated at <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/32d6m0d1\" target=\"_blank\">roughly 17.5 billion gallons</a>. Assuming a 50 percent consumption ratio, that means 35 billion gallons of water withdrawal, or about 0.3 percent of the <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/pp1894D/full\" target=\"_blank\">total public water supply</a> for the contiguous United States. The same report projects that the U.S. data center direct water consumption could double or even quadruple the 2023 level by 2028.</p><p>On the national level, data centers\u2019 water use is relatively modest. But in some regions where data centers are concentrated\u2014and especially in regions already facing shortages\u2014the strain on local water systems can be significant. <em>Bloomberg News</em> reports that about two-thirds of U.S. data centers built since 2022 <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-impacts-data-centers-water-data/\" target=\"_blank\">are in high water-stress areas</a>. </p><p>In Newton County, Georgia, some proposed data centers have reportedly requested more water per day than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-data-center-water.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the entire county uses</a> daily. Officials there now face tough choices: reject new projects, require alternative water-efficient cooling systems, invest in costly infrastructure upgrades, or risk imposing water rationing on residents.</p><p>The biggest stress may not be total use, but timing. On hot days when residents and businesses need water most, data center water demand spikes too. In Arizona, a data center\u2019s monthly water usage during the summer can be <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344922000428\" target=\"_blank\">nearly twice its average level</a>.</p><h2>Indirect Water Use: Thirsty Electricity</h2><p>The other part of the equation is the electricity that powers data centers. In many places, electricity\u2014whether for training AI models in data centers or turning on a lightbulb in a home\u2014is generated by fossil fuel-based power plants that require cooling water of their own. The U.S. electric power sector<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56820\" target=\"_blank\"> withdraws about 11.6 gallons of water</a> and<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/32d6m0d1\" target=\"_blank\"> consumes 1.2 gallons</a> for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced, placing it among the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/source-and-use-water-us-2015\" target=\"_blank\">nation\u2019s largest water users</a>. The water used to produce the electricity that powers data centers is considered indirect water use. </p><p>The water used by power plants is typically not potable and not drawn from municipal water systems. Still, it can place stress on rivers, aquifers, and ecosystems\u2014especially in water-scarce regions.</p><p>For most U.S. data centers, this indirect use is significantly higher than direct onsite water use. One paper estimated that in 2023, using GPT-3 to generate a single text output of 150 to 300 words <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3724499\" target=\"_blank\">consumed a total of 16.9 milliliters</a> of water in an average U.S. data center\u20142.2 ml for onsite cooling and 14.7 ml for electricity generation. It\u2019s likely that efficiency gains in later models have reduced these numbers, but indirect water use still predominates.</p><h2>How to Minimize Data Centers\u2019 Water Impact</h2><p>Unlike electricity, data center cooling systems are a design choice. Evaporative cooling is low-cost and efficient, but it can burden local supplies during summer heatwaves, when water is most needed and least available. To manage that peak demand, data centers can build onsite water storage or install thermal energy storage. Upgrading water infrastructure\u2014such as expanding distribution or fixing leaks\u2014can also help local systems better handle demand spikes.</p><p>Alternatives to evaporative cooling include air-based and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/immersion-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">liquid-immersion cooling</a>, using recycled water to cut potable water use, and waste heat reuse to reduce cooling demand. Some advanced designs recycle cooling water in a closed-loop, so no water is consumed; these \u201czero-water\u201d designs eliminate the need to tap into local drinking water supplies. However, many of these designs raise electricity demand, which in turn can increase indirect water use. Water-cooled data centers <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-commitment-to-climate-conscious-data-center-cooling/\" target=\"_blank\">consume about 10 percent less energy</a> than air-cooled data centers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of servers immersed in a water tank for cooling purposes.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"33256\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-servers-immersed-in-a-water-tank-for-cooling-purposes.jpg?id=61560218&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In immersion cooling systems, servers are submerged in a fluid that carries heat away without evaporating water. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jason Alden/Bloomberg/Getty Images</small></p><p>In water-stressed regions, the priority should be low- to zero-water cooling systems to reduce direct use, while investing to add <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/renewable-energy\" target=\"_blank\">renewables</a> to the local grids to curb indirect water use and minimize carbon emissions from higher electricity demand. In wetter regions with carbon-intensive grids, priority should be given to reducing power use to lower the overall water consumption, even if that means continued use of evaporative cooling with its higher onsite water consumption.</p><p>The reality of the intertwined water and electricity systems forces data center operators to navigate tough trade-offs between global climate goals and local water needs. These choices often aren\u2019t simple, but until renewables dominate electricity grids, they may be unavoidable.</p><p><em>The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers or affiliated institutions.</em></p>"

Sixty percent longer than the biggest existing aircraft, with 12 times as much cargo space as a 747, the behemoth will look like an oil tanker that\u2019s sprouted wings\u2014aeronautical engineering at a preposterous scale.</p><p>Called WindRunner, and expected by 2030, it\u2019ll haul just one thing: massive wind-turbine blades. In most parts of the world, onshore wind-turbine blades can be built to a length of 70 meters, max. This size constraint comes not from the limits of blade engineering or physics; it\u2019s transportation. Any larger and the blades couldn\u2019t be moved over land, since they wouldn\u2019t fit through tunnels or overpasses, or be able to accommodate some of the sharper curves of roads and rails.</p><p>So the WindRunner\u2019s developer, <a href=\"https://radia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Radia</a> of Boulder, Colo., has staked its business model on the idea that the only way to get extralarge blades to wind farms is to fly them there. \u201cThe companies in the industry\u2026know how to make turbines that are the size of the Eiffel Tower with blades that are longer than a football field,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-lundstrom-aa848/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Lundstrom</a>, Radia\u2019s founder and CEO. \u201cBut they\u2019re just frustrated that they can\u2019t deploy those machines [on land].\u201d</p><p>Radia\u2019s plane will be able to hold two 95-meter blades or one 105-meter blade, and land on makeshift dirt runways adjacent to wind farms. This may sound audacious\u2014an act of hubris undertaken for its own sake. But Radia\u2019s supporters argue that WindRunner is simply the right tool for the job\u2014the only way to make onshore wind turbines bigger.</p><p>Bigger turbines, after all, can generate more energy at a lower cost per megawatt. But the question is: Will supersizing airplanes be worth the trouble?</p><h2>Wind Turbine Blade Transportation Challenges</h2><p>Lundstrom, an aerospace engineer, founded Radia nine years ago after coming across a plea for help from wind-turbine manufacturers. In their plea, posted as a press release, the manufacturers said they could build bigger onshore blades if there were simply a way to move them, Lundstrom recalls.</p><p>In the United States, for example, the height of interstate highway overpasses\u2014typically 4.9 meters (16 feet)\u2014won\u2019t allow for bigger turbine blades to pass. The overpass limitation is true for Europe too. There\u2019s more flexibility in the developing world, where there are fewer tunnels and overpasses generally, Lundstrom says. But many of the roads aren\u2019t paved or hardened, which makes it much tougher to move 50-tonne objects around.</p><p>Some regions in China don\u2019t have the same road constraints, allowing extralarge onshore wind turbines to be built there. Last year, Chinese multinational <a href=\"https://en.sanyre.com.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">Sany Renewable Energy</a> announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.sanyglobal.com/press_releases/3922/\" target=\"_blank\">installed a 15-megawatt model in Tongyu</a>, Jilin province, in northeast China, with blades that are 131 meters long. The blades were manufactured in an industrial park in Inner Mongolia, an 1,800-kilometer trek from where they were ultimately installed.</p><h3>The WindRunner</h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of a plane designed to transport large turbine blades, showcasing its unique features from a side view.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9b5ce\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-a-plane-designed-to-transport-large-turbine-blades-showcasing-its-unique-features-from-a-side-view.png?id=61574471&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/floating-offshore-wind-turbine\" target=\"_self\">Offshore wind farm developers</a> suffer from the logistical and practical challenges of operating in open ocean, but finding vessels big enough to transport the blades isn\u2019t one of those. The biggest offshore blades measure <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/energy/world-largest-offshore-wind-turbine-20-mw-mingyang/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 250 meters</a>, and they\u2019re usually transported via cargo ship. Manufacturers typically locate their facilities on the coast<strong>.</strong></p><p>Onshore, the movement of blades has met the hard limits of infrastructure. Shipping them in multiple pieces and reassembling them on-site won\u2019t work because the joints would create weak spots. Junctions would also add too much weight compared with that of blades made from single pieces of polymer, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-arent-27572/\" target=\"_blank\">Doug Arent</a>, executive director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Foundation and emeritus NREL researcher.</p><p>\u201cIt comes down to the stress engineering of the components,\u201d Arent says. Blades could one day be 3D-printed on-site, which could negate the need for an airplane, but that research is still in early stages, he says. (Lundstrom says 3D-printed blades will never happen, since it would require a large, sophisticated manufacturing facility to be built at every wind farm.)</p><p>If moving blades in pieces is folly, then the way forward is to fly. But even the largest existing cargo planes\u2014the C-5 and C-17 flown by the U.S. Air Force and the Russo-Ukrainian Antonov AN-124 Ruslan\u2014can\u2019t accommodate large turbine blades. \u201cThere really is no big cargo aircraft in production, or planned, except for ours,\u201d Lundstrom says.</p><h2>How to Make the World\u2019s Largest Aircraft Fly</h2><p>What you can experience of Radia\u2019s WindRunner today fits inside a conference room in the company\u2019s Boulder headquarters. Here, a kind of gazebo made of two-by-fours houses a flight simulator, where I\u2019m trying to virtually fly, and land, the behemoth.</p><p>There\u2019s a couple of pilot chairs, a joystick, a throttle, a video screen with a head-up display, and a few buttons to operate the simulated landing gear and wing flaps. The grid of flight instruments that will occupy the cockpit space above the pilot\u2019s head are not finished yet. Instead, laminated pictures of the eventual controls are Velcroed in place.</p><p>It takes surprisingly few levers and controls to fly the WindRunner. \u201cPhysics is physics,\u201d says my copilot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/etan-karni-aero/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Etan Karni</a>, principal engineer and head of Radia\u2019s advanced systems groups. As Karni controls the WindRunner\u2019s airspeed, I pull up on the joystick and guide it off the runway of a virtual Denver International Airport. A few minutes later I make a planned U-turn around a nearby lake. The maneuver is wobbly; I remind myself to move the joystick gently even though this is such a big bird.</p><h3>The WindRunner</h3><br /><img alt=\"Aerial diagram of WindRunner airplane design with annotated features on a field background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2d8ce\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/aerial-diagram-of-windrunner-airplane-design-with-annotated-features-on-a-field-background.png?id=61574317&amp;width=980\" /><p><br /></p><p>With Karni\u2019s aid in controlling the landing gear and flaps, we set down back in Denver. I not only keep the WindRunner in one enormous piece but also bring it to a stop at the very front of the runway, just before the visible streaks of burned rubber from other airliners.</p><p>In the real world, this remarkable feat of deceleration will enable the WindRunner to stop within 10 lengths of the aircraft\u2014about 1,080 meters. And the aircraft won\u2019t need the perfected runways of contemporary airports. It\u2019s designed, by necessity, to land on and take off from rugged dirt tracks\u2014like access roads on the perimeter of a wind farm, but wider.</p><p>These capabilities are enabled by the plane\u2019s relatively light weight, its wing and body shape, and its big tires. Optimized for cargo volume rather than mass\u2014because turbine blades are huge but not dense\u2014WindRunner is, effectively, one giant cargo hold with the bare minimum of amenities required to make it fly. \u201cLanding on dirt basically comes down to how many pounds per wheel you have,\u201d Lundstrom told me.</p><p>WindRunner\u2019s four jet engines will aid with short takeoffs. \u201cWhen the aircraft is empty,\u201d Lundstrom says, \u201cthe engines are so powerful that the vehicle has a thrust-to-weight ratio similar to early fighter jets.\u201d (Radia chose an engine already in use by modern airlines, but hasn\u2019t disclosed which one.)</p><p>To allow the plane to quickly turn skyward without scraping its underside, its back end will sweep away from the ground at a sharp angle. A single tail tall enough to stabilize the WindRunner would exceed airports\u2019 height limit of 24 meters, so Radia designed it with two risers in the shape of the letter <em><em>H</em></em>.</p><p>For landings, the aircraft\u2019s broad and stubby wings use their nearly 1,000-square-meter surface to catch air and decelerate quickly. Twenty big tires borrowed from the classic design of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s C-130 Hercules will help WindRunner slow down after it touches the ground.</p><p>The plane\u2019s mouth flips up to reveal its cavernous interior, a feature borrowed from the Antonov An-124. The cockpit, itself about as big as an entire Gulfstream private jet, looks like a pimple bulging from the WindRunner\u2019s staggering frame. It sticks out from the fuselage to avoid interfering with cargo space and is the only part of the plane designed for human habitation. During flight, the hold is only pressurized to about the level of the peak of Mt. Everest, to save energy.</p><h2>Why Wind Turbines Got Bigger</h2><p>During my visit to Radia, a virtual-reality headset lets me behold the colossus from underneath its wing and inside its cargo bay. It feels like standing next to a warehouse that can fly. Seeing the virtual superplane towering above, and grasping the plane\u2019s monumental scale makes me wonder if this adventure in engineering is necessary, that surely there\u2019s another way.</p><p>The largest helicopters built in the Western Hemisphere can carry up to 15 tonnes, but megablades can weigh four to five times that, Lundstrom notes. Blimps and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lta-research-airship-pathfinder-1\" target=\"_blank\">airships</a> can carry the weight, but they bring a laundry list of complications. They\u2019re too slow, need an expensive hangar to shield them from bad weather, require helium\u2014which is currently scarce\u2014and struggle to land when it\u2019s windy. \u201cAnd by the way, wind farms tend to be windy,\u201d he says.</p><p>And, since the world\u2019s biggest cargo planes can\u2019t be stretched to meet the length of a 100-meter blade, nor can they land on short, rugged runways, a new design is needed. Still, the fundamental question remains: Is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/bird-deaths-from-wind-turbines\" target=\"_blank\">increasing the size of onshore wind turbines</a> by 50 percent worth the trouble?</p><p><a href=\"https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/michael-f-howland/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Howland</a>, a wind-optimization expert at MIT, says there\u2019s a huge value proposition in it. A turbine\u2019s power-generation capacity increases by the cube of the wind speed blowing through it and the square of the diameter of the circle created by the spinning blades, he says. In other words, bigger turbines, while more expensive per individual unit, more than make up for it in generating capacity. That\u2019s why the size of turbines has grown steadily larger over the years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re able to have half as many,\u201d Lundstrom adds. \u201cSo even though the cost of each turbine has gone up, the cost per gigawatt goes way down.\u201d He estimates that GigaWind turbines would decrease the cost of energy by 20 to 35 percent while increasing output by 10 to 20 percent, potentially doubling wind\u2019s profitability even with the cost of all those flights included.</p><p>Having fewer total turbines means a wind farm could space them farther apart, avoiding airflow interference. The turbines would be nearly <a href=\"https://radia.com/wind-energy\" target=\"_blank\">twice as tall</a>, so they\u2019ll reach a higher, gustier part of the atmosphere. And big turbines don\u2019t need to spin as quickly, so they would make economic sense in places with average wind speeds around 5 meters per second compared with the roughly 7 m/s needed to sustain smaller units. \u201cThe result\u2026is more than a doubling of the acres in the world where wind is viable,\u201d Lundstrom says.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A rendering of the WindRunner aircraft on a dirt track in the desert next to a wind farm \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ddeee\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rendering-of-the-windrunner-aircraft-on-a-dirt-track-in-the-desert-next-to-a-wind-farm.png?id=61559596&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Upon the WindRunner\u2019s landing at a wind farm, rail equipment will roll turbine blades off the plane. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Radia</small></p><p>To kick-start this market, and to support the first WindRunners, Radia is developing a business arm that partners with wind-turbine manufacturers to develop new wind farms both domestically and internationally. WindRunners would deliver blades to those farms and those developed by other companies.</p><p>The scope of Radia\u2019s plan, and the ambition behind it, has impressed many observers, including Howland. \u201cI was both surprised but also very impressed by the innovative spirit of the idea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be ambitious in terms of solving the grand challenges.\u201d But onshore \u201cgigawind\u201d is full of unknowns, he notes. Less is understood about the flow physics and engineering of record-breaking turbine sizes. Plus, huge blades could create wakes so large that the turbines behind them would be noticeably affected by variations in air temperature and even the Coriolis effect caused by Earth\u2019s rotation, and might require innovation in fundamental science, he says.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the question of the big plane\u2019s carbon footprint. To move enough blades for a whole wind-farm operation, a WindRunner might fly back and forth from factory to farm every day for months, carrying one or two blades at a time. This may create more carbon emissions compared with trucking them. But Radia argues that the increased amount of clean energy created by advanced wind farms would be far more than enough to offset the CO<sub>2</sub> from the jet engines. Besides, the biggest component of a wind farm\u2019s carbon footprint is the concrete and steel. With longer blades allowing for fewer turbines to create the same amount of energy, carbon contributions should decrease, Lundstrom argues.</p><p>As Radia continues its quest, a dark cloud hangs over the endeavor. U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have made multiple attempts to grind the American wind-energy industry to a halt by pausing approvals, permits, and government loans. But Lundstrom pushes back against the notion that the prevailing winds out of Washington will clip Radia\u2019s wings. There\u2019s simply too much money to be made, he says.</p><p>\u201cMy belief is that [it\u2019ll] sort itself out\u2026.We\u2019ll be delivering [planes] at the end of this administration,\u201d Lundstrom says. Increasing the scale at which societies can produce wind power is crucial for a future without fossil fuels. And that scale, he says, can\u2019t be reached without a new airplane to make it possible. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

If so, you aren\u2019t alone. Nearly <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/05/impostor-syndrome-has-its-advantages\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent of high-achieving adults experience it</a>, according to an article in the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Harvard Business Review</em></em></a>.</p><p>Common signs of imposter syndrome include <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7174434/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">persistent self-doubt and considering yourself a fraud despite evidence to the contrary</a>, according to a <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/journal/11606\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Journal of General Internal Medicine</em></em></a> article.</p><p>To help engineers learn how to manage feelings of inadequacy, <a href=\"https://wie.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Women in Engineering</a> recently held the <a href=\"https://ieeetv.ieee.org/channels/wie/webinar-conquer-impostor-syndrome-to-advance-your-career\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Conquer Impostor Syndrome to Advance Your Career</a> webinar. <a href=\"https://www.kimmeninger.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kim Meninger</a>, a leadership coach, consultant, and motivational speaker, gave tips on building confidence and overcoming anxiety.</p><p>Here are her recommendations.</p><h2>Manage disruptive thoughts</h2><p>Imposter syndrome is not a clinical diagnosis but a form of anxiety, Meninger said.</p><p>\u201cThere is no arguing with the fact that being worried someone at work is going to find out you\u2019re not capable of doing your job is fear-based,\u201d she said. The brain interprets fear as a sign of danger, she added, and that triggers a fight-or-flight physiological reaction.</p><p>When faced with social threats such as failure, rejection, and humiliation, she said, the fight-or-flight response can cause a person to lose the ability to reason, solve problems, and think clearly.</p><p>If that happens, she said, analyze what you fear and what might happen if things go sour. Create an action plan if it happens. When you have a plan, she said, you feel more in control.</p><p>When people are anxious, however, it\u2019s often difficult for them to strategize. Meninger\u2019s suggestions on how to stay calm include: </p><p><strong>Take deep breaths.</strong> It sends a signal to your brain that there is no physical threat. If you are going into a meeting that you know will trigger your anxiety, start breathing exercises a few minutes before it starts.</p><p><strong>Bring water with you. </strong>Taking a sip of your beverage during your presentation is a great pause button, buying you time to think about what you want to say next, Meninger said, and drinking something won\u2019t attract attention. You gain a moment to collect yourself.</p><p><strong>Speak slowly.</strong> Anxious people often start speaking quickly, she said. Words and thoughts can diverge, and you can lose the ability to communicate clearly. If you intentionally speak slower, it requires you to focus, diverting your attention from any panic you\u2019re feeling. It also makes you appear more in command of your message.</p><h2>Adopt a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d</h2><p>The growth mindset, Meninger said, is the belief that a person\u2019s abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication to learning and hard work, rather than being fixed traits.</p><p>Many people develop a fixed mindset in adulthood, believing that their abilities and intelligence are unchangeable. If you have a growth mindset, you believe you can control your destiny and choose whether you want to invest in becoming better at something.</p><p>People with a fixed mindset who are not good at math, for example, might attribute it to a lack of understanding the subject. Those with a growth mindset might study or find a tutor to help them, knowing that they can improve with focus and time.</p><p>Having a growth mindset can help you become more confident and less likely to experience imposter syndrome, Meninger said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to be aware when you start blaming genetics or natural abilities for what you view as shortcomings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always notice the way we adopt fixed mindsets.\u201d</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cYour strengths are the raw materials that allow you to make an impact on your team, organization, family, and community.\u201d</span></p><p>That is where what Meninger calls the <em><em>power of yet</em></em> comes into play. When you tell yourself that you\u2019re not good at something, add a <em><em>yet</em></em> at the end of the sentence. For example, say \u201cI\u2019m not good at presenting yet,\u201d rather than simply \u201cI\u2019m not good at presenting.\u201d</p><p>Adding that single word opens up the possibility of improving rather than making the lack of a skill a definitive statement that can\u2019t be changed, she said.</p><p>Another suggested way to practice a growth mindset is to \u201cbecome a beginner intentionally,\u201d Meninger said. \u201cPerfectionists only take risks where they\u2019re virtually guaranteed to succeed. Because of this, they tend not to experience the discomfort of learning and growing.\u201d</p><p>One way to break out of that cycle, she said, is to learn a new skill outside of work, such as knitting, art, playing a musical instrument, or speaking another language.</p><h2>Celebrate your successes</h2><p>Many people don\u2019t take time to celebrate their successes. Instead, they focus on their mistakes and failures, whether real or perceived. One reason, Meninger said, is that culture and family expectations influence the way people view mistakes and successes. Several cultures teach humility and that one should not talk about their successes, as it can be boastful.</p><p>\u201cWe owe it to ourselves to unapologetically accept that we have strengths,\u201d Meninger said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing shameful about that. Your strengths are the raw materials that allow you to make an impact on your team, organization, family, and community.\u201d</p><p>If you don\u2019t know what you do well, you can\u2019t channel it in a positive direction, she said. Knowing your strengths isn\u2019t about stroking your ego but rather understanding how you can be of service to others.</p><p>Your brain won\u2019t focus on your successes naturally, so it\u2019s important to practice, Meninger said. One way to do so is to keep an accomplishment journal. Write down three things each day that went well, or problems you solved, at work or in your personal life.</p><p>Your journal also can be used as a source when you need to fill out a performance evaluation for your employer or to make a case for a promotion, she said. It helps to build your confidence because you can see your successes listed.</p><h2>Leverage your resources</h2><p>You don\u2019t need to be an expert on every subject, Meninger said; you just need to recognize what you don\u2019t know. To gain expertise, create relationships with people who have knowledge you\u2019re missing, she recommended: Instead of putting pressure on yourself to be all-knowing, think about who at your company can complement your skills and how you can work with them.</p><p>Also, if you\u2019re worried that everyone else in a meeting has more experience than you and you\u2019re doubting your contributions, inquire why you were invited. Ask the meeting organizer what they would like you to contribute or what information they want you to prepare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go into a mystery meeting that will cause you more anxiety,\u201d Meninger cautioned.</p><p>When you ask such questions, you likely will learn the organizer invited you because of a strength you have.</p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-updates-2025\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Women in Engineering</a> regularly hosts <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/tips-on-how-to-elevate-your-career/\" target=\"_blank\">career-related</a> webinars, which are available to <a href=\"https://wie.ieee.org/events/category/webinars/career/\" target=\"_blank\">watch on demand on its website</a>.
