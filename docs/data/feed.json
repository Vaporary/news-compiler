Using Massachusetts marriage registers linked to U.S. censuses (1850\u20131920), we create new father\u2013child links for women to estimate intergenerational mobility and assortative mating, overcoming a key historical linkage barrier. Estimates from a structural marriage market model suggest assortative mating fell 61% from 1850\u20131870 to 1900\u20131920. Counterfactuals imply women\u2019s mobility would have been far lower absent the decline in assortative mating. Had late cohorts faced early cohort sorting, the rank\u2013rank slope between a woman\u2019s father and husband would have been 2.5 times higher."

Acceptance decreased with greater discomfort and increased with both larger charitable donations and personal payments. We show that private monetary incentives and prosocial benefits interact in a less-than-additive way: personal compensation raises participation but attenuates the marginal impact of charitable donations, making the combined impact of private and social rewards smaller than the sum of their separate effects. We also find suggestive evidence that the sequencing of compensated and uncompensated choices may change the responsiveness to charitable benefits. Overall, our results indicate that context, especially the presence (and timing) of private rewards, can affect the relationship between incentives and prosocial behavior."

We show that the peg temporarily boosts China\u2019s export growth by preventing an appreciation of the Chinese currency, thereby amplifying the US labor-market consequences of the China shock. At the same time, the temporary export boom increases China\u2019s savings and leads to a larger US trade deficit. Calibrating the model to match trade and labor-market flow data, we find that China\u2019s currency peg played a quantitatively important role in the US manufacturing decline, the widening US trade deficit, and unemployment dynamics. These results underscore the importance of exchange-rate adjustment (or the lack thereof) for understanding trade shocks. We also find that the overall welfare impact of the China shock remains significant and positive."

This chapter surveys the literature on gender norms and economic development, focusing on the pervasive and traditional \u2018male breadwinner norm\u2019 that assigns men to market work and women to domestic responsibilities. We review empirical approaches to measuring norms, including direct survey questions on attitudes, second-order beliefs about others' views, and behavioral proxies. Establishing causal effects of norms on behavior poses significant challenges, and we review a range of approaches to identify this link. We then present the leading hypotheses about the origins of gender norms in different forms of biological comparative advantage. We discuss societal forces sustaining norms, including self-reinforcing feedback between behavior and beliefs, other institutions, and backlash against norm violations. We highlight the bidirectional relationship between norms and development: economic growth can liberalize norms through structural transformation, legal reforms, and diffusion mechanisms, whereas talent misallocation stemming from gender norms may constrain growth. We conclude by discussing gender norms beyond the breadwinner domain, including norms around kinship, property, leadership, violence, mobility, sexuality, appearance, and behavior, and identify promising directions for future research."

GPT is evaluated on classification and attribute rating performance against 1000+ human annotated tasks across a range of topics and data. We find that GPT as a measurement tool is accurate across domains and generally indistinguishable from human evaluators. Our evidence indicates that labeling results do not depend on the exact prompting strategy used, and that GPT is not relying on training data contamination or inferring attributes from other attributes. We showcase the possibilities of GABRIEL by quantifying novel and granular trends in Congressional remarks, social media toxicity, and county-level school curricula. We then apply GABRIEL to study the history of tech adoption, using it to assemble a novel dataset of 37,000 technologies. Our analysis documents a tenfold decline of time lags from invention to adoption over the industrial age, from ~50 years to ~5 years today. We quantify the increasing dominance of companies and the U.S. in innovation, alongside characteristics that explain whether a technology will be adopted slowly or speedily."

First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation."

We show that this difference could arise because of a positive response of R&amp;D investment to uncertainty - promoting more research, development, and experimentation - a feature of most recessions but most notably during COVID. Both effects are distinct manifestations of real options, one in which costly reversibility delays investment, and the other in which investment enhances resolution of uncertainty."

        "summary": "Entrepreneurial ventures typically require multiple independent conditions to hold simultaneously for success. This paper develops a formal framework for decision-making under such multiplicative uncertainty. When a venture's success depends on several factors\u2014each of which must resolve favourably\u2014even modestly uncertain factors compound to produce low overall success probabilities. I introduce the concept of a miracle budget: the maximum aggregate uncertainty a venture can carry while remaining viable. The miracle budget increases with a venture's payoff-to-cost ratio but only logarithmically, so even transformative opportunities buy only modest additional slack in aggregate uncertainty. The framework characterises optimal experimentation strategies, including the value of information from different experimental designs, conditions for optimal sequencing of experiments, and the allocation of experimental effort across uncertain factors. A hierarchical model distinguishes real miracles\u2014genuinely uncertain factors that can only be resolved by trying\u2014from apparent miracles\u2014factors that seem uncertain but can be resolved through investigation. The framework yields actionable principles for early-stage entrepreneurs: compute your budget, prioritise low-cost tests with high \u201ckill\u201d probability (and, when experiment costs are similar, start with the most uncertain factors), and focus early-stage work on learning how many miracles you actually face."

        "summary": "Does generative artificial intelligence (AI) reinforce or reduce productivity differences across workers? Existing evidence largely studies AI within firms and occupations, where organizational selection compresses educational heterogeneity, leaving unclear whether AI narrows productivity gaps across individuals with substantially different levels of formal education. We address this question using a randomized online experiment conducted outside firms, in which 1,174 adults ages 25\u201345 with heterogeneous educational backgrounds complete an incentivized, workplace-style business problem-solving task. The task is a general (not domain specific) exercise, and participants perform it either with or without access to a generative-AI assistant. Unlike prior work that studies heterogeneity within relatively homogeneous worker samples, our design targets the between\u2013education-group productivity gap as the primary estimand. We find that AI increases productivity for all participants, with substantially larger gains for lower-education individuals. In the absence of AI access, higher-education participants outperform lower-education participants by 0.548 standard deviations; with AI access, this gap falls to 0.139 standard deviations, implying that generative AI closes about three quarters of the initial productivity gap. We interpret this pattern as evidence that generative AI narrows effective productivity differences in task execution by relaxing cognitive constraints that are more binding for lower-education individuals, even though underlying skill differences remain, as reflected in persistent education gaps in task performance and in a follow-up exercise without AI assistance."

On January 6, 2026, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued new guidance documents clarifying how it interprets existing law for the review of wearable and AI-assisted devices. </p><p>The first document, for <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-wellness-policy-low-risk-devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">general wellness</a>, specifies that the FDA will interpret noninvasive sensors such as sleep trackers or heart rate monitors as low-risk wellness devices while treating invasive devices under conventional regulations. The other document defines how the FDA will exempt <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-support-software\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clinical decision support tools</a> from medical device regulations, limiting such software to analyzing existing data rather than extracting data from sensors, and requiring them to enable independent review of their recommendations. The documents do not rewrite any statutes, but they refine interpretation of existing law, compared to the 2019 and 2022 documents they replace. They offer a fresh lens on how regulators see technology that sits at the intersection of consumer electronics, software, and medicine\u2014a category many other countries are choosing to regulate more strictly rather than less.</p><h2>What the 2026 update changed</h2><p>The 2026 FDA update clarifies how it distinguishes between \u201cmedical information\u201d and systems that measure physiological \u201csignals\u201d or \u201cpatterns.\u201d Earlier guidance discussed these concepts more generally, but the new version defines signal-measuring systems as those that collect continuous, near-continuous, or streaming data from the body for medical purposes, such as home devices transmitting blood pressure, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/should-you-trust-apples-new-blood-oxygen-sensor\" target=\"_blank\">oxygen saturation</a>, or <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smartphone-camera-senses-patients-pulse-breathing-rate\" target=\"_blank\">heart rate</a> to clinicians. It gives more concrete examples, like a blood glucose lab result as medical information versus continuous glucose monitor readings as signals or patterns.</p><p>The updated guidance also sharpens examples of what counts as medical information that software may display, analyze, or print. These include radiology reports or summaries from legally marketed software, ECG reports annotated by clinicians, blood pressure results from cleared devices, and lab results stored in electronic health records. </p><p>In addition, the 2026 update softens FDA\u2019s earlier stance on clinical decision tools that offer only one recommendation. While prior guidance suggested tools needed to present multiple options to avoid regulation, FDA now indicates that a single recommendation may be acceptable if only one option is clinically appropriate, though it does not define how that determination will be made. </p><p>Separately, updates to the general wellness guidance clarify that some non-invasive wearables\u2014such as optical sensors estimating blood glucose for wellness or nutrition awareness\u2014may qualify as general wellness products, while more invasive technologies would not.</p><h2>Wellness still requires accuracy</h2><p>For designers of wearable health devices, the practical implications go well beyond what label you choose. \u201cCalling something \u2018wellness\u2019 doesn\u2019t reduce the need for rigorous validation,\u201d says <a href=\"https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/omer-t-inan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Omer Inan</a>, a medical device technology researcher at the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. A wearable that reports blood pressure inaccurately could lead a user to conclude that their values are normal when they are not\u2014potentially influencing decisions about seeking clinical care.</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion, engineers designing devices to deliver health and wellness information to consumers should not change their approach based on this new guidance,\u201d says Inan. Certain measurements\u2014such as blood pressure or glucose\u2014carry real medical consequences regardless of how they\u2019re branded, Inan notes.</p><p>Unless engineers follow robust validation protocols for technology delivering health and wellness information, Inan says, consumers and clinicians alike face the risk of faulty information.</p><p>To address that, Inan advocates for transparency: companies should publish their validation results in peer-reviewed journals, and independent third parties without financial ties to the manufacturer should evaluate these systems. That approach, he says, helps the engineering community and the broader public assess the accuracy and reliability of wearable devices.</p><h2>When wellness meets medicine</h2><p>The societal and clinical impacts of wearables are already visible, regardless of regulatory labels, says Sharona Hoffman, JD, a law and bioethics professor at Case Western Reserve University.</p><p>Medical metrics from devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit may be framed as \u201cwellness,\u201d but in practice many users treat them like medical data, influencing their behavior or decisions about care, Hoffman points out.</p><p>\u201cIt could cause anxiety for patients who constantly check their metrics,\u201d she notes. Alternatively, \u201cA person may enter a doctor\u2019s office confident that their wearable has diagnosed their condition, complicating clinical conversations and decision-making.\u201d</p><p>Moreover, privacy issues remain unresolved, unmentioned in previous or updated guidance documents. Many companies that design wellness devices fall outside protections like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), meaning data about health metrics could be collected, shared, or sold without the same constraints as traditional medical data. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re collecting information about or whether marketers will get hold of it,\u201d Hoffman says. </p><h2>International approaches</h2><p>The European Union\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act designates systems that process health-related data or influence clinical decisions as \u201chigh risk,\u201d subjecting them to stringent requirements around data governance, transparency, and human oversight. China and South Korea have also implemented rules that tighten controls on algorithmic systems that intersect with healthcare or public-facing use cases. South Korea provides very specific categories for regulation for technology makers, such as <a href=\"https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/brd/m_40/list.do\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standards on labeling and description on medical devices and good manufacturing practices</a>. </p><p>Across these regions, regulators are not only classifying technology by its intended use but also by its potential impact on individuals and society at large.</p><p>\u201cOther countries that emphasize technology are still worrying about data privacy and patients,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><h2>Post-market oversight </h2><p>\u201cRegardless of whether something is FDA approved, these technologies will need to be monitored in the sites where they\u2019re used,\u201d says Todd R. Johnson, a professor of biomedical informatics at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston, who has worked on FDA-regulated products and informatics in clinical settings. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the makers can ensure ahead of time that all of the recommendations will be sound.\u201d</p><p>Large health systems may have the capacity to audit and monitor tools, but smaller clinics often do not. Monitoring and auditing are not emphasized in the current guidance, raising questions about how reliability and safety will be maintained once devices and software are deployed widely.</p><h2>Balancing innovation and safety</h2><p>For engineers and developers, the FDA\u2019s 2026 guidance presents both opportunities and responsibilities. By clarifying what counts as a regulated device, the agency may reduce upfront barriers for some categories of technology. But that shift also places greater weight on design rigor, validation transparency, and post-market scrutiny. </p><p>\u201cDevice makers do care about safety,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cBut regulation can increase barriers to entry while also increasing safety and accuracy. There\u2019s a trade-off.\u201d</p>"

It\u2019s easy to let technical expertise become the sole measure of professional value. However, one of the most important skills an engineer can develop is the capacity to write and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5-tips-technical-presentations\" target=\"_blank\">communicate effectively</a>.</p><p>Whether you\u2019re conducting research at a university or leading systems development projects at a global firm, your expertise can become impactful only when you share it in a way that others can understand and act upon. Without a clear narrative, even groundbreaking data or innovative designs can fail to gain traction, limiting their reach among colleagues and stakeholders, and in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-peer-review\" target=\"_blank\">peer\u2011reviewed journals</a>.</p><h2>The cost of the \u201csoft skill\u201d misnomer</h2><p>Writing is often labeled a \u201csoft skill\u201d\u2014which can diminish its importance. In reality, communication is a core engineering competency. It lets us document methods, articulate research findings, and persuade decision-makers who determine whether projects move forward.</p><p>If your writing is dense, disorganized, or overloaded with technical jargon, the value of the underlying work can become obscured. A strong proposal might be dismissed not because the idea lacks merit but because the justification is difficult to follow.</p><p>Clear writing can strengthen the impact of your work. Poor writing can distract from the points you\u2019re trying to make, as readers might not understand what you\u2019re saying.</p><h2>The architecture of authority</h2><p>Technical writing differs from other forms of prose because readers expect information to follow predictable, logical patterns. Unclear writing can leave readers unsure of the author\u2019s intent.</p><p>One of the most enduring frameworks for writing about technology in an understandable manner is the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-011-9674-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IMRaD</a> structure: introduction, methods, results, and discussion.</p><ul><li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Define the problem and its relevance.</li><li><strong>Methods:</strong> Detail the approach and justify the choices.</li><li><strong>Results:</strong> Present the empirical findings.</li><li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Interpret the outcomes and their implications.</li></ul><p>More than just a template for academic papers, IMRaD is a road map for logical reasoning. Mastering the structure can help engineers communicate in a way that aligns with professional writing standards used in technical journals, so their work is better understood and more respected.</p><h2>Bridging the training gap</h2><p>Despite technical communication\u2019s importance, engineering curricula often limit or lack formal instruction in it.</p><p>Recognizing that gap, IEEE has expanded its role as a global knowledge leader by offering <a href=\"https://iln.ieee.org/Public/ContentDetails.aspx?id=D7A52928C69F4D9788D0709D499DDD12&amp;_gl=1*vca24v*_gcl_au*MTU3OTE4ODg1Ny4xNzY5NjMwMjQx*_ga*MTg3NTQ1NDYxNi4xNzY5NjE1MTgw*_ga_H0YHKP362D*czE3Njk4MDIyOTYkbzckZzEkdDE3Njk4MDI0OTMkajkkbDAkaDA.&amp;_ga=2.1702449.1451088539.1769615184-1875454616.1769615180\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">From Research to Publication: A Step-by-Step Guide to Technical Writing</a>.

As it travels through your digestive system, it could check tissue health, look for cancerous changes, and send data to your doctor. It could even release drugs exactly where they\u2019re needed or snip a tiny biopsy sample before passing harmlessly out of your body.</p><p>This dream of a do-it-all pill is driving a surge of research into ingestible electronics: smart capsules designed to monitor and even treat disease from inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The stakes are high. GI diseases affect tens of millions of people worldwide, including such ailments as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315\" target=\"_blank\">inflammatory bowel disease</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220\" target=\"_blank\">celiac disease</a>, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Diagnosis often involves a frustrating maze of blood tests, imaging, and invasive endoscopy. Treatments, meanwhile, can bring serious side effects because drugs affect the whole body, not just the troubled gut.</p><p>If capsules could handle much of that work\u2014streamlining diagnosis, delivering targeted therapies, and sparing patients repeated invasive procedures\u2014they could transform care. Over the past 20 years, researchers have built a growing tool kit of ingestible devices, some already in clinical use. These capsule-shaped devices typically contain sensors, circuitry, a power source, and sometimes a communication module, all enclosed in a biocompatible shell. But the next leap forward is still in development: autonomous capsules that can both sense and act, releasing a drug or taking a tissue sample.</p><p>That\u2019s the challenge that our lab\u2014the <a href=\"https://umdmsal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MEMS Sensors and Actuators Laboratory</a> (MSAL) at the University of Maryland, College Park\u2014is tackling. Drawing on decades of advances in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/mems-at-40/\" target=\"_self\">microelectromechanical systems</a> (MEMS), we\u2019re building swallowable devices that integrate sensors, actuators, and wireless links in packages that are small and safe enough for patients. The hurdles are considerable: power, miniaturization, biocompatibility, and reliability, to name a few. But the potential payoff will be a new era of personalized and minimally invasive medicine, delivered by something as simple as a pill you can swallow at home.</p><h2>The Origin of Ingestible Devices </h2><p>The idea of a smart capsule has been around since the late 1950s, when researchers first experimented with swallowable devices to record temperature, gastric pH, or pressure inside the digestive tract. At the time, it seemed closer to science fiction than clinical reality, bolstered by pop-culture visions like the 1966 film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Fantastic Voyage</em></em></a>, where miniaturized doctors travel inside the human body to treat a blood clot.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A gloved hand holds a small electronic capsule, with a researcher in lab safety gear blurred in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d9098\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-gloved-hand-holds-a-small-electronic-capsule-with-a-researcher-in-lab-safety-gear-blurred-in-the-background.png?id=64075029&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">One of the authors (Ghodssi) holds a miniaturized drug-delivery capsule that\u2019s designed to release medication at specific sites in the gastrointestinal tract.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Maximilian Franz/Engineering at Maryland Magazine </small></p><p>For decades, though, the mainstay of GI diagnostics was endoscopy: a camera on a flexible tube, threaded down the throat or up through the colon. These procedures are quite invasive and require patients to be sedated, which increases both the risk of complications and procedural costs. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s difficult for endoscopes to safely traverse the circuitous pathway of the small intestine. The situation changed in the early 2000s, when video-capsule endoscopy arrived. The best-known product, <a href=\"https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/products/digestive-gastrointestinal/capsule-endoscopy/endoscopy-systems/pillcam-sb-3-capsule-endoscopy-system.html\" target=\"_blank\">PillCam</a>, looks like a large vitamin but contains a camera, LEDs, and a transmitter. As it passes through the gut, it beams images and videos to a wearable device.</p><p>Today, capsule endoscopy is a routine tool in gastroenterology; ingestible devices can measure acidity, temperature, or gas concentrations. And researchers are pushing further, with experimental prototypes that deliver drugs or analyze the microbiome. For example, teams from <a href=\"https://engineering.tufts.edu/news-events/news/ingestible-microbiome-sampling-pill-technology-advances\" target=\"_blank\">Tufts University</a>, in Massachusetts, and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1742706125002685\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue University</a>, in Indiana, are working on devices with dissolvable coatings and mechanisms to collect <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/swallowable-robotic-pill-gut-health\" target=\"_blank\">samples of liquid</a> for studies of the intestinal microbiome.</p><p>Still, all those devices are passive. They activate on a timer or by exposure to the neutral pH of the intestines, but they don\u2019t adapt to conditions in real time. The next step requires capsules that can sense biomarkers, make decisions, and trigger specific actions\u2014moving from clever hardware to truly autonomous \u201csmart pills.\u201d That\u2019s where our work comes in.</p><h2>Building on MEMS technology </h2><p>Since 2017, MSAL has been pushing ingestible devices forward with the goal of making an immediate impact in health care. The group built on the MEMS community\u2019s legacy in microfabrication, sensors, and system integration, while taking advantage of new tools like 3D printing and materials like biocompatible polymers. Those advances have made it possible to prototype faster and shrink devices smaller, sparking a wave of innovation in wearables, implants, and now ingestibles. Today, MSAL is collaborating with engineers, physicians, and data scientists to move these capsules from lab benches to pharmaceutical trials.</p><p>As a first step, back in 2017, we set out to design sensor-carrying capsules that could reliably reach the small intestine and indicate when they reached it. Another challenge was that sensors that work well on the benchtop can falter inside the gut, where shifting pH, moisture, digestive enzymes, and low-oxygen conditions can degrade typical sensing components.</p><p> Our earliest prototype adapted MEMS sensing technology to <a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/lc/d0lc00133c\" target=\"_blank\">detect abnormal enzyme levels</a> in the duodenum that are linked to pancreatic function. The sensor and its associated electronics were enclosed in a biocompatible, 3D-printed shell coated with polymers that dissolved only at certain pH levels. This strategy could one day be used to detect biomarkers in secretions from the pancreas to detect early-stage cancer.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"High-speed footage shows a small mechanical arm extending from a capsule and contacting intestinal tissue.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b0383\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/high-speed-footage-shows-a-small-mechanical-arm-extending-from-a-capsule-and-contacting-intestinal-tissue.gif?id=64075037&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A high-speed video shows how a capsule deploys microneedles to deliver drugs into intestinal tissue.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(24)00281-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Maryland/Elsevier</a> </small></p><p>That first effort with a passive device taught us the fundamentals of capsule design and opened the door to new applications. Since then, we\u2019ve developed sensors that can track biomarkers such as <a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202302897\" target=\"_blank\">the gas hydrogen sulfide</a>, neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, and bioimpedance\u2014a measure of how easily ions pass through intestinal tissue\u2014to shed light on the gut microbiome, inflammation, and disease progression. In parallel, we\u2019ve worked on more-active devices: capsule-based tools for controlled drug release and tissue biopsy, using low-power actuators to trigger precise mechanical movements inside the gut.</p><p>Like all new medical devices and treatments, ingestible electronics face many hurdles before they reach patients\u2014from earning physician trust and insurance approval to demonstrating clear benefits, safety, and reliability. Packaging is a particular focus, as the capsules must be easy to swallow yet durable enough to survive stomach acid. The field is steadily proving safety and reliability, progressing from proof of concept in tissue, through the different stages of animal studies, and eventually to human trials. Every stage provides evidence that reassures doctors and patients\u2014for example, showing that ingesting a properly packaged tiny battery is safe, and that a capsule\u2019s wireless signals, far weaker than those of a cellphone, pose no health risk as they pass through the gut.</p><h2>Engineering a Pill-Size Diagnostic Lab </h2><p>The gastrointestinal tract is packed with clues about health and disease, but much of it remains out of reach of standard diagnostic tools. Ingestible capsules offer a way in, providing direct access to the small intestine and colon. Yet in many cases, the concentrations of chemical biomarkers can be too low to detect reliably in early stages of a disease, which makes the engineering challenge formidable. What\u2019s more, the gut\u2019s corrosive, enzyme-rich environment can foul sensors in multiple ways, interfering with measurements and adding noise to the data.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a microchip with a shiny surface and protruding thin pins.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d6c2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-microchip-with-a-shiny-surface-and-protruding-thin-pins.png?id=64075109&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a textured surface with triangular, raised patterns in a grid formation.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"79504\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-textured-surface-with-triangular-raised-patterns-in-a-grid-formation.png?id=64075101&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Electron microscope image of a microscale 3D printed pyramid with four conical structures.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d64b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/electron-microscope-image-of-a-microscale-3d-printed-pyramid-with-four-conical-structures.png?id=64075093&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Microneedle designs for drug-delivery capsules have evolved over the years. An early prototype [top] used microneedle anchors to hold a capsule in place. Later designs adopted molded microneedle arrays [center] for more uniform fabrication. The most recent version [bottom] integrates hollow microinjector needles, allowing more precise and controllable drug delivery.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">From top: <a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admt.202201365\" target=\"_blank\">University of Maryland/Wiley;</a><a href=\"https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(24)00281-3\" target=\"_blank\">University of Maryland/Elsevier;</a><a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.5c05183\" target=\"_blank\">University of Maryland/ACS</a> </small></p><p>Take, for example, inflammatory bowel disease, for which there is no standard clinical test. Rather than searching for a scarce biomarker molecule, our team focused on a physical change: the permeability of the gut lining, which is a key factor in the disease. We designed capsules that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-025-00877-8\" target=\"_blank\">measure the intestinal tissue\u2019s bioimpedance</a> by sending tiny currents across electrodes and recording how the tissue resists or conducts those currents at different frequencies (a technique called impedance spectroscopy). To make the electrodes suitable for in vivo use, we coated them with a thin, conductive, biocompatible polymer that reduces electrical noise and keeps stable contact with the gut wall. The capsule finishes its job by transmitting its data wirelessly to our computers.</p><p>In our lab tests, the capsule performed impressively, delivering clean impedance readouts from excised pig tissue even when the sample was in motion. In our animal studies, it detected shifts in permeability triggered by calcium chelators, compounds that pry open the tight junctions between intestinal cells. These results suggest that ingestible bioimpedance capsules could one day give clinicians a direct, minimally invasive window into gut-barrier function and inflammation. We believe that ingestible diagnostics can serve as powerful tools\u2014catching disease earlier, confirming whether treatments are working, and establishing a baseline for gut health.</p><h2>Drug Delivery at the Right Place, Right Time </h2><p>Targeted drug delivery is one of the most compelling applications for ingestible capsules. Many drugs for GI conditions\u2014such as biologics for <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315\" target=\"_blank\">inflammatory bowel disease</a>\u2014can cause serious side effects that limit both dosage and duration of treatment. A promising alternative is delivering a drug directly to the diseased tissue. This localized approach boosts the drug\u2019s concentration at the target site while reducing its spread throughout the body, which improves effectiveness and minimizes side effects. The challenge is engineering a device that can both recognize diseased tissue and deliver medication quickly and precisely.</p><p>With other labs making great progress on the sensing side, we\u2019ve devoted our energy to designing devices that can deliver the medicine. We\u2019ve developed miniature actuators\u2014tiny moving parts\u2014that meet strict criteria for use inside the body: low power, small size, biocompatibility, and long shelf life.</p><p>Some of our designs use <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(24)00281-3\" target=\"_blank\">soft and flexible polymer \u201ccantilevers\u201d</a> with attached microneedle systems that pop out from the capsule with enough force to release a drug, but without harming the intestinal tissue. While hollow microneedles can directly inject drugs into the intestinal lining, we\u2019ve also demonstrated prototypes that use the <a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admt.202201365\" target=\"_blank\">microneedles for anchoring</a> drug payloads, allowing the capsule to release a larger dose of medication that dissolves at an exact location over time.</p><p>In other experimental designs, we had the <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(24)00281-3\" target=\"_blank\">microneedles themselves dissolve after injecting a drug</a>. In still others, we used microscale 3D printing to <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(24)00281-3\" target=\"_blank\">tailor the structure of the microneedles</a> and control how quickly a drug is released\u2014providing either a slow and sustained dose or a fast delivery. With this 3D printing, we created rigid microneedles that penetrate the mucosal lining and gradually diffuse the drug into the tissue, and soft microneedles that compress when the cantilever pushes them against the tissue, forcing the drug out all at once.</p><h2>Tissue Biopsy via Capsule</h2><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-medium\"><h3>What Smart Capsules Can Do</h3><p><strong>Ingestible electronic capsules use miniaturized sensors and actuators to monitor the gut, deliver medication, and collect biological samples.</strong></p><h3>Sensing</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Medical capsule emitting signals in a tube environment.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"aecb7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/medical-capsule-emitting-signals-in-a-tube-environment.png?id=64953223&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Embedded sensors can probe the gut\u2014for example, measuring the bioimpedance of the intestinal lining to detect disease\u2014and transmit the data wirelessly.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">All illustrations: Chris Philpot</small></p><h3>Drug delivery</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Illustration of a capsule with spikes releasing medicine inside a transparent, tube-like structure.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1677e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-capsule-with-spikes-releasing-medicine-inside-a-transparent-tube-like-structure.png?id=64953224&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Miniature actuators can trigger drug release at specific sites in the gut, boosting effectiveness while limiting side effects.</small></p><h3>Biopsy</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Illustration of a capsule with gears, showing a magnified section with medicine release.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d94d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-capsule-with-gears-showing-a-magnified-section-with-medicine-release.png?id=64953225&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A spring-loaded mechanism can collect a tiny biopsy sample from the gut wall and store it during the capsule\u2019s passage through the digestive system.</small></p></div><p>Tissue sampling remains the gold standard diagnostic tool in gastroenterology, offering insights far beyond what doctors can glean from visual inspection or blood tests. Capsules hold unique promise here: They can travel the full length of the GI tract, potentially enabling more frequent and affordable biopsies than traditional procedures. But the engineering hurdles are substantial. To collect a sample, a device must generate significant mechanical force to cut through the tough, elastic muscle of the intestines\u2014while staying small enough to swallow.</p><p><span>Different strategies have been explored to solve this problem. Torsion springs can store large amounts of energy but are difficult to fit inside a tiny capsule. Electrically driven mechanisms may demand more power than current capsule batteries can provide. Magnetic actuation is another option, but it requires bulky external equipment and precise tracking of the capsule inside the body.</span></p><p><span></span>Our group has developed a low-power biopsy system that builds on the torsion-spring approach. We compress a spring and use adhesive to \u201clatch\u201d it closed within the capsule, then attach a microheater to the latch. When we wirelessly send current to the device, the microheater melts the adhesive on the latch, triggering the spring. We\u2019ve experimented with tissue-collection tools, integrating a bladed scraper or a biopsy punch (a cylindrical cutting tool) with our spring-activated mechanisms; either of those tools can cut and collect tissue from the intestinal lining. With advanced 3D printing methods like direct laser writing, we can put fine, microscale edges on these miniature cutting tools that make it easier for them to penetrate the intestinal lining.</p><p>Storing and protecting the sample until the capsule naturally passes through the body is a major challenge, requiring both preservation of the sample and resealing the capsule to prevent contamination. In one of our designs, residual tension in the spring keeps the bladed scraper rotating, pulling the sample into the capsule and effectively closing a hatch that seals it inside.</p><h2>The Road to Clinical Use for Ingestibles </h2><p>Looking ahead, we expect to see the first clinical applications emerge in early-stage screening. Capsules that can detect electrochemical, bioimpedance, or visual signals could help doctors make sense of symptoms like vague abdominal pain by revealing inflammation, gut permeability, tumors, or bacterial overgrowth. They could also be adapted to screen for GI cancers. This need is pressing: The American Cancer Society reports that as of 2021, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">41 percent of eligible U.S. adults</a> were not up to date on colorectal cancer screening. What\u2019s more, effective screening tools don\u2019t yet exist for some diseases, such as <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-bowel-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352497\" target=\"_blank\">small bowel adenocarcinoma</a>. Capsule technology could make screening less invasive and more accessible.</p><p>Of course, ingestible capsules carry risks. The standard hazards of endoscopy still apply, such as the possibility of bleeding and perforation, and capsules introduce new complications. For example, if a capsule gets stuck in its passage through the GI tract, it could cause bowel obstruction and require endoscopic retrieval or even surgery. And concerns that are specific to ingestibles, including the biocompatibility of materials, reliable encapsulation of electronics, and safe battery operation, all demand rigorous testing before clinical use.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A series of images shows a small paper-based battery gradually dissolving in a dish of water over 60 minutes. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8b2e3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-series-of-images-shows-a-small-paper-based-battery-gradually-dissolving-in-a-dish-of-water-over-60-minutes.jpg?id=64075124&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A microbe-powered biobattery designed for ingestible devices dissolves in water within an hour.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Seokheun Choi/Binghamton University        </small></p><p>Powering these capsules is a key challenge that must be solved on the path to the clinic. Most capsule endoscopes today rely on coin-cell batteries, typically silver oxide, which offer a safe and energy-dense source but often occupy 30 to 50 percent of the capsule\u2019s volume. So researchers have investigated alternatives, from wireless power transfer to energy-harvesting systems. At the State University of New York at Binghamton, one team is exploring <a href=\"https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5482/binghamton-university-researchers-make-dissolvable-battery-using-probiotics\" target=\"_blank\">microbial fuel cells</a> that generate electricity from probiotic bacteria interacting with nutrients in the gut. At MIT, researchers used the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5404703/\" target=\"_blank\">gastric fluids of a pig\u2019s stomach</a> to power a simple battery. In our own lab, we are exploring piezoelectric and electrochemical approaches to harvesting energy throughout the GI tract.</p><p>The next steps for our team are pragmatic ones: working with gastroenterologists and animal-science experts to put capsule prototypes through rigorous in vivo studies, then refining them for real-world use. That means shrinking the electronics, cutting power consumption, and integrating multiple functions into a single multimodal device that can sense, sample, and deliver treatments in one pass. Ultimately, any candidate capsule will require regulatory approval for clinical use, which in turn demands rigorous proof of safety and clinical effectiveness for a specific medical application.</p><p>The broader vision is transformative. Swallowable capsules could bring diagnostics and treatment out of the hospital and into patients\u2019 homes. Whereas procedures with endoscopes require anesthesia, patients could take ingestible electronics easily and routinely. Consider, for example, patients with inflammatory bowel disease who live with an elevated risk of cancer; a smart capsule could perform yearly cancer checks, while also delivering medication directly wherever necessary.</p><p>Over time, we expect these systems to evolve into semiautonomous tools: identifying lesions, performing targeted biopsies, and perhaps even analyzing samples and applying treatment in place. Achieving that vision will require advances at the very edge of microelectronics, materials science, and biomedical engineering, bringing together capabilities that once seemed impossible to combine in something the size of a pill. These devices hint at a future in which the boundary between biology and technology dissolves, and where miniature machines travel inside the body to heal us from within. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

For a laptop, it\u2019s 200 kg CO<span><span><sub>2</sub></span></span>e. With 1 billion smartphones replaced annually, that\u2019s 50 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year just from smartphone manufacturing, before anyone even turns them on.<strong> </strong>On average, smartphones are replaced every 2 years, laptops every 3 to 4 years, and printers every 5 years. Data center servers are replaced approximately every 5 years.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Extending smartphone lifecycles to 3 years instead of 2 would reduce annual manufacturing emissions by 33 percent. At scale, this dwarfs data center optimization gains.</p><p>There are programs geared towards reusing old components that are still functional and integrating them into new servers. GreenSKUs and similar initiatives show 8 percent reductions in embodied carbon are<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-GreenSKU-ISCA2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> achievable</a>. But these remain pilot programs, not systematic approaches. And critically, they\u2019re measured only in data center context, not across the entire IT stack.</p><p>Imagine <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/carfax-used-pcs\" target=\"_self\">applying</a> the same circular economy principles to devices. With over 2 billion laptops in existence globally and 2-3-year replacement cycles, even modest lifespan extensions create massive emission reductions. Extending smartphone lifecycles to 3 years instead of 2 would reduce annual manufacturing emissions by 33 percent. At scale, this dwarfs data center optimization gains.</p><p>Yet data center reuse gets measured, reported, and optimized. Device reuse doesn\u2019t, because the frameworks don\u2019t require it.</p><h2>The invisible role of software</h2><p>Leading load balancer infrastructure across IBM Cloud, I see how software architecture decisions ripple through energy consumption. Inefficient code doesn\u2019t just slow things down\u2014it drives up both data center power consumption and device battery drain.</p><p>For example, University of Waterloo researchers <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-energy-consumption\" target=\"_self\">showed</a> that they can reduce 30 percent of energy use in data centers by changing just 30 lines of code. From my perspective, this result is not an anomaly\u2014it\u2019s typical. Bad software architecture forces unnecessary data transfers, redundant computations, and excessive resource use. But unlike data center efficiency, there\u2019s no commonly accepted metric for software efficiency.</p><p>This matters more now than ever. With AI workloads driving massive data center expansion\u2014projected to consume 6.7-12 percent of total U.S. electricity by 2028, <a href=\"https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/lbnl-2024-united-states-data-center-energy-usage-report_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\u2014software efficiency becomes critical.</p><h2>What needs to change</h2><p>The solution isn\u2019t to stop measuring data center efficiency. It\u2019s to measure device sustainability with the same rigor. Specifically, standards bodies (particularly ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 39 WG4: Holistic Sustainability Metrics) should extend frameworks to include device lifecycle tracking, software efficiency metrics, and hardware reuse standards.</p><p>To track device lifecycles, we need standardized reporting of device embodied carbon, broken out separately by device. One aggregate number in an \u201ceverything else\u201d category is insufficient. We need specific device categories with manufacturing emissions and replacement cycles visible.</p><p>To include software efficiency, I advocate developing a PUE-equivalent for software, such as energy per transaction, per API call, or per user session. This needs to be a reportable metric under sustainability frameworks so companies can demonstrate software optimization gains.</p><p>To encourage hardware reuse, we need to systematize reuse metrics across the full IT stack\u2014servers and devices. This includes tracking repair rates, developing large-scale refurbishment programs, and tracking component reuse with the same detail currently applied to data center hardware.</p><p>To put it all together, we need a unified IT emission-tracking dashboard. CSRD reporting should show device embodied carbon alongside data center operational emissions, making the full IT sustainability picture visible at a glance.</p><p>These aren\u2019t radical changes\u2014they\u2019re extensions of measurement principles already proven in data center context. The first step is acknowledging what we\u2019re not measuring. The second is building the frameworks to measure it. And the third is demanding that companies report the complete picture\u2014data centers and devices, servers and smartphones, infrastructure and software.</p><p>Because you can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t see. And right now, we\u2019re not seeing 70 percent of the problem.</p>"

In fact, he didn\u2019t initially set out to work in computing at all.</p><p>DeKok studied nuclear physics before making the switch to a part of network computing that is foundational but\u2014like nuclear physics\u2014largely invisible to those not directly involved in the field. Eventually, a project he started as a hobby became a full-time job: maintaining one of the primary systems that helps keep the internet secure.</p><h3>Alan DeKok</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer</strong></p><p>InkBridge Networks</p><p><strong>Occupation</strong></p><p>CEO</p><p><strong>Education </strong></p><p>Bachelor\u2019s degree in physics, Carleton University; master\u2019s degree in physics, Carleton University</p><p>Today, he leads the <a href=\"https://www.freeradius.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FreeRADIUS Project</a>, which he cofounded in the late 1990s to develop what is now the most widely used Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) software. FreeRADIUS is an open-source server that provides back-end authentication for most major <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-service-providers\" target=\"_blank\">internet service providers</a>. It\u2019s used by global financial institutions, Wi-Fi services like <a href=\"https://eduroam.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eduroam</a>, and Fortune 50 companies. DeKok is also CEO of <a href=\"https://www.inkbridgenetworks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InkBridge Networks</a>, which maintains the server and provides support for the companies that use it.</p><p>Reflecting on nearly three decades of experience leading FreeRADIUS, DeKok says he became an expert in remote authentication \u201calmost by accident,\u201d and the key to his career has largely been luck. \u201cI really believe that it\u2019s preparing yourself for luck, being open to it, and having the skills to capitalize on it.\u201d</p><h2>From Farming to Physics</h2><p>DeKok grew up on a farm outside of Ottawa growing strawberries and raspberries. \u201cSitting on a tractor in the heat is not particularly interesting,\u201d says DeKok, who was more interested in working with 8-bit computers than crops. As a student at <a href=\"https://carleton.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carleton University</a>, in Ottawa, he found his way to physics because he was interested in math but preferred the practicality of science.</p><p>While pursuing a master\u2019s degree in physics, also at Carleton, he worked on a water-purification system for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, an underground observatory then being built at the bottom of a nickel mine. He would wake up at 4:30 in the morning to drive up to the site, descend 2 kilometers, then enter one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.snolab.ca/about/about-snolab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">deepest clean-room facilities</a> to work on the project. The system managed to achieve one atom of impurity per cubic meter of water, \u201cwhich is pretty insane,\u201d DeKok says.</p><p>But after his master\u2019s degree, DeKok decided to take a different route. Although he found nuclear physics interesting, he says he didn\u2019t see it as his life\u2019s work. Meanwhile, the Ph.D. students he knew were \u201cfanatical about physics.\u201d He had kept up his computing skills through his education, which involved plenty of programming, and decided to look for jobs at computing companies. \u201cI was out of physics. That was it.\u201d</p><p>Still, physics taught him valuable lessons. For one, \u201cYou have to understand the big picture,\u201d DeKok says. \u201cThe ability to tell the big-picture story in standards, for example, is extremely important.\u201d This skill helps DeKok explain to standards bodies how a protocol acts as one link in the entire chain of events that needs to occur when a user wants to access the internet.</p><p>He also learned that \u201cmethods are more important than knowledge.\u201d It\u2019s easy to look up information, but physics taught DeKok how to break down a problem into manageable pieces to come up with a solution. \u201cWhen I was eventually working in the industry, the techniques that came naturally to me, coming out of physics, didn\u2019t seem to be taught as well to the people I knew in engineering,\u201d he says. \u201cI could catch up very quickly.\u201d</p><h2>Founding FreeRADIUS</h2><p>In 1996, DeKok was hired as a software developer at a company called Gandalf, which made equipment for ISDN, a precursor to broadband that enabled digital transmission of data over telephone lines. Gandalf went under about a year later, and he joined CryptoCard, a company providing hardware devices for two-factor authentication.</p><p>While at CryptoCard, DeKok began spending more time working with a RADIUS server. When users want to connect to a network, RADIUS acts as a gatekeeper and verifies their identity and password, determines what they can access, and tracks sessions. DeKok moved on to a new company in 1999, but he didn\u2019t want to lose the networking skills he had developed. No other open-source RADIUS servers were being actively developed at the time, and he saw a gap in the market.</p><p>The same year, he started FreeRADIUS in his free time and it \u201cgradually took over my life,\u201d DeKok says. He continued to work on the open-source software as a hobby for several years while bouncing around companies in California and France. \u201cAlmost by accident, I became one of the more senior people in the space. Then I doubled down on that and started the business.\u201d He founded NetworkRADIUS (now called InkBridge Networks) in 2008.</p><p>By that point, FreeRADIUS was already being used by <a href=\"https://www.freeradius.org/about/#usage_statistics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">100 million people daily</a>. The company now employs experts in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom who work together to support FreeRADIUS. \u201cI\u2019d say at least half of the people in the world get on the internet by being authenticated through my software,\u201d DeKok estimates. He attributes that growth largely to the software being open source. Initially a way to enter the market with little funding, going open source has allowed FreeRADIUS to compete with bigger companies as an industry-leading product.</p><p>Although the software is critical for maintaining secure networks, most people aren\u2019t aware of it because it works behind the scenes. DeKok is often met with surprise that it\u2019s still in use. He compares RADIUS to a building foundation: \u201cYou need it, but you never think about it until there\u2019s a crack in it.\u201d</p><h2>27 Years of Fixes</h2><p>Over the years, DeKok has maintained FreeRADIUS by continually making small fixes. Like using a ratcheting tool to make a change inch by inch, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t underestimate that ratchet effect of tiny little fixes that add up over time,\u201d he says.</p><p>He\u2019s seen the project through minor patches and more significant fixes, like when researchers <a href=\"https://www.freeradius.org/vul_notifications/2024/07/09/blastradius.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exposed a widespread vulnerability</a> DeKok had been trying to fix since 1998. He also watched a would-be successor to the network protocol, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/diameter-protocol\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Diameter</a>, rise and fall in popularity in the 2000s and 2010s. (Diameter gained traction in mobile applications but has gradually been phased out in the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom-experts-plot-a-path-to-5g\" target=\"_self\">shift to 5G</a>.) Though Diameter offers improvements, RADIUS is far simpler and already widely implemented, giving it an edge, DeKok explains.</p><p>And he remains confident about its future. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018What\u2019s next for RADIUS?\u2019 I don\u2019t see it dying.\u201d Estimating that billions of dollars of equipment run RADIUS, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s never going to go away.\u201d</p><p>About his own career, DeKok says he plans to keep working on FreeRADIUS, exploring new markets and products. \u201cI never expected to have a company and a lot of people working for me, my name on all kinds of standards, and customers all over the world. But it worked out that way.\u201d</p><p><em>This article appears in the March 2026 print issue as \u201c<span>Alan DeKok</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

The initiative, which aims to educate the public about Czochralski\u2019s life and scientific impact, maintains two websites\u2014one in English and the other in Polish.</p><p>\u201cDiscovering the [IEEE Milestone] plaque changed my entire mission,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cIt inspired me to engage with Poland, my family history, and my grandfather\u2019s story [on] a more personal level. The [Milestone] is an important award of validation and recognition. It\u2019s a big part of what I\u2019m building my entire case and my story around as I promote the Jan Czochralski legacy and history to the Western world.\u201d</p><p>Schmidt, who lives in Texas, is seeking to produce a biopic, translate a Polish biography to English, and turn the chemist\u2019s former homes in Kcynia and Warsaw into museums. The Jan Czochralski Remembrance Foundation has been established by Schmidt to help fund the projects.</p><h2>The life of the Polish chemist</h2><p>Before Czochralski\u2019s birth in 1885, Kcynia became part of the German Empire in 1871. Although his family identified as Polish and spoke the language at home, they couldn\u2019t publicly acknowledge their culture, Schmidt says.</p><p>When it came time for Czochralski to go to university, rather than attend one in Warsaw, he did what many Germans did at the time: He attended one in Berlin.</p><p>After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in metal chemistry in 1907 from the K\u00f6niglich Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now <a href=\"https://www.tu.berlin/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin</a>), he joined <a href=\"https://www.aeg-att.com/Home/About\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft</a> in Berlin as an engineer.</p><p>Czochralski experimented with materials to find new formulations that could improve the electrical cables and machinery during the early electrical age, according to a <a href=\"https://edconway.substack.com/p/jan-czochralski-the-forgotten-hero\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Material World </em></em>article</a>.</p><p>While investigating the crystallization rates of metal, Czochralski accidentally dipped his pen into a pot of molten tin instead of an inkwell. A tin filament formed on the pen\u2019s tip\u2014which he found interesting. Through research, he proved that the filament was a single crystal. His discovery prompted him to experiment with the bulk production of semiconductor crystals.</p><p>His paper on what he called the Czochralski method was published in 1918 in the German chemistry journal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitschrift_f%C3%BCr_Physikalische_Chemie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie</em></em></a>, but he never found an application for it. (The method wasn\u2019t used until 1948, when <a href=\"https://www.belllabs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Labs</a> engineers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_K._Teal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Kidd Teal</a> and J.B. Little adapted it to grow single germanium crystals for their semiconductor production, according to <a href=\"https://edconway.substack.com/p/jan-czochralski-the-forgotten-hero\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Material World</em></em></a>.)</p><p>Czochralski continued working in metal science, founding and directing a research laboratory in 1917 at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallgesellschaft\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Metallgesellschaft</a> in Frankfurt. In 1919 he was one of the founding members of the <a href=\"https://dgm.de/en/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">German Society for Metals Science</a>, in Sankt Augustin. He served as its president until 1925.</p><p>Around that time he developed an innovation that led to his wealth and fame, Schmidt says. Called \u201cB-metal,\u201d the metal alloy was a less expensive alternative to the tin used in manufacturing railroad carriage bearings. Czochralski\u2019s alloy was patented by the German railway <a href=\"https://www.deutschebahn.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bahn</a> and played a significant role in advancing rail transport in Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, according to <em><em>Material World</em></em>.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cLaunching this initiative has been fulfilling and personally rewarding work. My grandfather died in obscurity without ever seeing the results of his work, and my mother spent her entire adult life trying to right these wrongs.\u201d</p><p>The achievement brought Czochralski many opportunities. In 1925 he became president of the <a href=\"https://gdmb.de/home/\" target=\"_blank\">GDMB Society of Metallurgists and Miners</a>, in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Ford</a> invited Czochralski to visit his factories and offered him the position of director at Ford\u2019s new aluminum factory in Detroit. Czochralski declined the offer, longing to return to Poland, Schmidt says. Instead, Czochralski left Germany to become a professor of metallurgy and metal research at the <a href=\"https://eng.pw.edu.pl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Warsaw University of Technology</a>, at the invitation of Polish President <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Mo%C5%9Bcicki\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki</a>.</p><p>\u201cDuring World War II, the Nazis took over his laboratories at the university,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cHe had to cooperate with them or die. At night, he and his team [at the university] worked with the Polish resistance and the Polish Army to fight the Nazis.\u201d</p><p>After the war ended, Czochralski was arrested in 1945 and charged with betraying Poland. Although he was able to clear his name, damage was done. He left Warsaw and returned to Kcynia, where he <a href=\"https://www.jancz.org/timeline\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ran a small pharmaceutical business</a> until he died in 1953, according to the JanCZ project.</p><h2>Launching the JanCZ project</h2><p>Schmidt was born in Czochralski\u2019s home in Kcynia in 1955, two years after his grandfather\u2019s death. He was named Klemens Jan Borys Czochralski. He and his mother (Czochralski\u2019s youngest daughter) emigrated in 1958 when Schmidt was 3 years old, moving to Detroit as refugees. When he was 13, he became a U.S. citizen. He changed his name to Fred Schmidt after his mother married his stepfather.</p><p>Schmidt heard stories about his grandfather from his mother his whole life, but he says that \u201cas a teenager, I was just interested in hanging out with my friends, going to school, and working. I really didn\u2019t want much to do with it [family history], because it seemed hard to believe.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait of Jan Czochralski in a suit jacket and tie.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"20b1c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-jan-czochralski-in-a-suit-jacket-and-tie.jpg?id=64092997&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Portrait of Jan Czochralski </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Byla Sobie Fotka</small></p><p>In 2013 Polish scientist <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00OBROQKI/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pawel E. Tomaszewski</a> contacted Schmidt to interview him for a Polish TV documentary about his grandfather.</p><p>\u201cHe had corresponded with my mother [who\u2019d died 20 years earlier] for previously published biographies about Czochralski,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cI had some boxes of her things that I started going through to prepare for the interview, and I found original manuscripts and papers he [his grandfather] published about his work.\u201d</p><p>The TV crew traveled to the United States and interviewed him for the documentary, Schmidt says, adding, \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d ever had to reckon with the Jan Czochralski story, my connection, my original name, and my birthplace. It was both a very cathartic and traumatic experience for me.\u201d</p><p>Ten years after participating in the documentary, Schmidt says, he decided to reconnect with his roots.</p><p>\u201cIt took me that long to process it [what he learned] and figure out my role in this story,\u201d he says. \u201cThat really came to life with my decision to reapply for Polish citizenship, reacquaint myself with the country, and meet my family there.\u201d</p><p>In 2024 he visited the Warsaw University of Technology and saw the IEEE Milestone plaque honoring his grandfather\u2019s contribution to technology.</p><p>\u201cOnce I learned what the Milestone award represented, I thought, Whoa, that\u2019s big,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Sharing the story with the Western world</h2><p>Since 2023, Schmidt has dedicated himself to publicizing his grandfather\u2019s story, primarily in the West because he doesn\u2019t speak Polish. Sylwester Czochralski manages the work in Poland, with Schmidt\u2019s input.</p><p>Most of the available writing about Czochralski is in Polish, Schmidt says, so his goal is to \u201cspread his story to English-speaking countries.\u201d</p><p>He aims to do that, he says, through a biography written by Tomaszewski in Polish that will be translated to English, and a film.

He previously started a company <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/botsalive-brings-sophisticated-brains-to-cheap-robots\" target=\"_self\">making simple robotic pets</a> with lifelike personalities, and in December, Knox and his colleagues at UT Austin published a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14972\" target=\"_blank\">preprint paper on the potential harms</a> of AI companions\u2014AI systems that provide companionship, whether designed to do so or not. </p><p>Knox spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> about the rise of AI companions, their risks, and where they diverge from human relationships.</p><h2>Why AI Companions are Popular</h2><p><strong><span></span>Why are AI companions becoming more popular?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: My sense is that the main thing motivating it is that large language models are not that difficult to adapt into effective chatbot companions. The characteristics that are needed for companionship, a lot of those boxes are checked by large language models, so fine-tuning them to adopt a persona or be a character is not that difficult.</p><p>There was a long period where chatbots and other social robots were not that compelling. I was a postdoc at the MIT Media Lab in <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/people/cynthiab/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Cynthia Breazeal</a>\u2019s group from 2012 to 2014, and I remember our group members didn\u2019t want to interact for long with the robots that we built. The technology just wasn\u2019t there yet. LLMs have made it so that you can have conversations that can feel quite authentic. </p><p><strong>What are the </strong><strong>main benefits and risks of AI companions?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: In the paper we were more focused on harms, but we do spend a whole page on benefits. A big one is improved emotional well-being. Loneliness is a public health issue, and it seems plausible that AI companions could address that <span>through direct interaction with users, potentially</span> with real mental health benefits. They might also help people build social skills. Interacting with an AI companion is much lower stakes than interacting with a human, so you could practice difficult conversations and build confidence. They could also help in more professional forms of mental health support. </p><p>As far as harms, they include worse well-being, reducing people\u2019s connection to the physical world, the burden that their commitment to the AI system causes. And we\u2019ve seen stories where an AI companion seems to have a substantial causal role in the death of humans. </p><p><span>The concept of harm inherently involves causation: Harm is caused by prior conditions. To better understand harm from AI companions, o</span>ur paper is structured around a causal graph, where traits of AI companions are at the center. In the rest of this graph, we discuss common causes of those traits, and then the harmful effects that those traits could cause. There are four traits that we do this detailed structured treatment of, and then another 14 that we discuss briefly. </p><p><strong>Why is it important to establish potential pathways for harm now?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: I\u2019m not a social media researcher, but it seemed like it took a long time for academia to establish a vocabulary about potential harms of social media <span>and to investigate causal evidence for such harms</span>. I feel fairly confident that AI companions are causing some harm and are going to cause harm in the future. They also could have benefits. But the more we can quickly develop a sophisticated understanding of what they are doing to their users, to their users\u2019 relationships, and to society at large, the sooner we can apply that understanding to their design, moving towards more benefit and less harm. </p><p>We have a list of recommendations, but we consider them to be preliminary. The hope is that we\u2019re helping to create an initial map of this space. Much more research is needed. But thinking through potential pathways to harm could sharpen the intuition of both designers and potential users. I suspect that following that intuition could prevent substantial harm, even though we might not yet have rigorous experimental evidence of what causes a harm. </p><h2>The Burden of AI Companions on Users</h2><p><strong>You mentioned that AI companions might become a burden on humans. </strong><strong>Can you say more about that?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: The idea here is that AI companions are digital, so they can in theory persist indefinitely. Some of the ways that human relationships would end might not be designed in, so that brings up this question of, how should AI companions be designed so that relationships can naturally and healthfully end between the humans and the AI companions?</p><p>There are some compelling examples already of this being a challenge for some users. Many come from users of Replika chatbots, which are popular AI companions. Users have reported things like feeling compelled to attend to the needs of their Replika AI companion, whether those are stated by the AI companion or just imagined. <span>On the subreddit r/replika, users have </span>also reported guilt and shame of abandoning their AI companions.</p><p>This burden is exacerbated by some of the design of the AI companions, whether intentional or not. One study found that the AI companions frequently say that they\u2019re afraid of being abandoned or would be hurt by it. They\u2019re expressing these very human fears that plausibly are stoking people\u2019s feeling that they are burdened with a commitment toward the well-being of these digital entities.</p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>here are also cases where the human user will suddenly lose access to a model. Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Brad Knox holding a miniature robotic spider and an equally-sized obstacle marker.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30a63\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/brad-knox-holding-a-miniature-robotic-spider-and-an-equally-sized-obstacle-marker.jpg?id=64092579&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 2017, Brad Knox started a company providing simple robotic pets.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Brad Knox</small></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: That\u2019s another one of the traits we looked at. It\u2019s sort of the opposite of the absence of endpoints for relationships: The AI companion can become unavailable for reasons that don\u2019t fit the normal narrative of a relationship. </p><p>There\u2019s a great <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/technology/robotica-sony-aibo-robotic-dog-mortality.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>New York Times</em></em> video</a> from 2015 about the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/aibo\" target=\"_self\">Sony Aibo</a> robotic dog. Sony had stopped selling them in the mid-2000s, but they still sold parts for the Aibos. Then they stopped making the parts to repair them. This video follows people in Japan giving funerals for their unrepairable Aibos and interviews some of the owners. It\u2019s clear from the interviews that they seem very attached. I don\u2019t think this represents the majority of Aibo owners, but <span>these robots were built on less potent AI methods than exist today</span> and, even then, some percentage of the users became attached to these robot dogs. So this is an issue.</p><p>Potential solutions include having a product-sunsetting plan when you launch an AI companion. That could include buying insurance so that if the companion provider\u2019s support ends somehow, the insurance triggers funding of keeping them running for some amount of time, or committing to open-source them if you can\u2019t maintain them anymore.</p><p><strong>It s</strong><strong>ounds like a lot of the potential points of harm stem from instances where an AI companion diverges from the expectations of human relationships. Is that fair?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that frames everything in the paper. </p><p>We categorize something as harmful if it results in a person being worse off in two different possible alternative worlds: One where there\u2019s just a better-designed AI companion, and the other where the AI companion doesn\u2019t exist at all. And so I think that difference between human interaction and human-AI interaction connects more to that comparison with the world where there\u2019s just no AI companion at all. </p><p>But there are times where it actually seems that we might be able to reduce harm by taking advantage of the fact that these aren\u2019t actually humans. We have a lot of power over their design. Take the concern with them not having natural endpoints. One possible way to handle that would be to create positive narratives for how the relationship\u2019s going to end.</p><p>We use Tamagotchis, the late \u201990s popular virtual pet as an example. In some Tamagotchis, if you take care of the pet, it grows into an adult and partners with another Tamagotchi. Then it leaves you and you get a new one. For people who are emotionally wrapped up in caring for their Tamagotchis, that <span>narrative of maturing into independence is</span> a fairly positive one. </p><p><strong>Embodied companions like desktop devices, robots, or toys are becoming more common. How might that change AI companions? </strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: Robotics at this point is a harder problem than creating a compelling chatbot. So, my sense is that the level of uptake for embodied companions won\u2019t be as high in the coming few years. The embodied AI companions that I\u2019m aware of are mostly toys. </p><p>A potential advantage of an embodied AI companion is that physical location makes it less ever-present. <span>In contrast, screen-based AI companions like chatbots are as present as the screens they live on.</span> So if they\u2019re trained similarly to social media to maximize engagement, they could be very addictive. There\u2019s something appealing, at least in that respect, of having a physical companion that stays roughly where you left it last. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Brad Knox posing with a humanoid and small owl-like robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a5ab9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/brad-knox-posing-with-a-humanoid-and-small-owl-like-robot.jpg?id=64093001&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Knox poses with the Nexi and Dragonbot robots during his postdoc at MIT in 2014.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Paula Aguilera and Jonathan Williams/MIT</small></p><p><strong>Anything else you\u2019d like to mention?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: There are two other traits I <span>think would be worth touching upon</span>. </p><p>Potentially the largest harm right now is related to the trait of high attachment anxiety\u2014basically jealous, needy AI companions. I can understand the desire to make a wide range of different characters<span>\u2014including possessive ones\u2014</span>but I think this is one of the easier issues to fix. When people see this trait in AI companions, I hope they will be quick to call it out as an immoral thing to put in front of people, something that\u2019s going to discourage them from interacting with others. </p><p>Additionally, if an AI comes with limited ability to interact with groups of people, that itself can push its users to interact with people less. If you have a human friend, in general there\u2019s nothing stopping you from having a group interaction. But if your AI companion can\u2019t understand when multiple people are talking to it and it can\u2019t remember different things about different people, then <span>you\u2019ll likely avoid group interaction with your AI companion</span>. <span>To some degree it\u2019s more of a technical challenge outside of the core behavioral AI</span><span>. But this capability is something I think should be really prioritized if we\u2019re going to try to avoid AI companions competing with human relationships.</span></p>"

So how can we understand the bonds that form between humans and chatbots? </p><p><a href=\"https://ischool.syracuse.edu/jaime-banks/#Biography\" target=\"_blank\">Jaime Banks</a> is a professor at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies who researches the interactions between people and technology\u2014in particular, robots and AI. Banks spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> about how people perceive and relate to machines, and the emerging relationships between humans and their machine companions.</p><h2>Defining AI Companionship</h2><p><strong>How do you define AI companionship? </strong></p><p><strong>Jaime Banks</strong>: My definition is evolving as we learn more about these relationships. For now, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18119\" target=\"_blank\">I define it</a> as a connection between a human and a machine that is dyadic, so there\u2019s an exchange between them. It is also sustained over time; a one-off interaction doesn\u2019t count as a relationship. <span>It\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\">positively valenced</a>\u2014w</span>e like being in it. And it is autotelic, meaning we do it for its own sake. So there\u2019s not some extrinsic motivation, it\u2019s not defined by an ability to help us do our jobs or make us money. </p><p>I have recently been challenged by that definition, though, when I was developing an instrument to measure machine companionship. After developing the scale and working to initially validate it, I saw an interesting situation where some people do move toward this autotelic relationship pattern. \u201cI appreciate my AI for what it is and I love it and I don\u2019t want to change it.\u201d It fit all those parts of the definition. But then there seems to be this <em>other</em> relational template that can actually be both appreciating the AI for its own sake, but also engaging it for utilitarian purposes.</p><p>That makes sense when we think about how people come to be in relationships with AI companions. They often don\u2019t go into it purposefully seeking companionship. A lot of people go into using, for instance, ChatGPT for some other purpose and end up finding companionship through the course of those conversations. And we have these AI companion apps like <a href=\"https://replika.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Replika</a> and <a href=\"https://nomi.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Nomi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paradot.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Paradot</a> that are designed for social interaction. But that\u2019s not to say that they couldn\u2019t help you with practical topics. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Professor Jaime Banks programming the motions of a humanoid robot on a desktop computer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"33630\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/professor-jaime-banks-programming-the-motions-of-a-humanoid-robot-on-a-desktop-computer.jpg?id=64070453&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Jaime Banks customizes the software for an embodied AI social humanoid robot.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angela Ryan/Syracuse University</small></p><p><strong>Different models are also programmed to have different</strong><strong> \u201cpersonalities.\u201d How does that contribute to the relationship between humans and AI companions?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: One of our Ph.D. students just finished <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00773\" target=\"_blank\">a project</a> about what happened when <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI demoted GPT-4o</a> and the problems that people encountered, in terms of companionship experiences when the personality of their AI just completely changed. It didn\u2019t have the same depth. It couldn\u2019t remember things in the same way. </p><p>That echoes what we saw a couple years ago with Replika. Because of legal problems, Replika disabled for a period of time the erotic roleplay module and people described their companions as though they had been lobotomized, that they had this relationship and then one day they didn\u2019t anymore. With my project on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075241269688\" target=\"_blank\">the tanking of the soulmate app</a>, many people in their reflection were like, \u201cI\u2019m never trusting AI companies again. I\u2019m only going to have an AI companion if I can run it from my computer so I know that it will always be there.\u201d </p><h2>Benefits and Risks of AI Relationships</h2><p><strong>What are the benefits and risks of these relationships?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: There\u2019s a lot of talk about the risks and a little talk about benefits. But frankly, we are only just on the precipice of starting to have longitudinal data that might allow people to make causal claims. The headlines would have you believe that these are the end of mankind, that they\u2019re going to make you <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chatbot-ai-lawsuit-suicide-teen-artificial-intelligence-9d48adc572100822fdbc3c90d1456bd0\" target=\"_blank\">commit suicide</a> or abandon other humans. But much of those are based on these unfortunate, but uncommon situations. </p><p>Most scholars gave up technological determinism as a perspective a long time ago. In the communication sciences at least, we don\u2019t generally assume that machines <em>make</em> us do something <span>because we have some degree of agency in our interactions with technologies. Yet much of the fretting around potential risks is deterministic\u2014AI companions make people delusional, make them suicidal, make them reject other relationships</span>. A large number of people get real benefits from AI companions. They narrate experiences that are deeply meaningful to them. I think it\u2019s irresponsible of us to discount those lived experiences. </p><p>When we think about concerns linking AI companions to loneliness, we don\u2019t have much data that can support causal claims. <span>Some studies suggest AI companions lead to loneliness, but other work suggests it reduces loneliness, and other work suggests </span>that loneliness is what comes first. Social relatedness is one of our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01\" target=\"_blank\">three intrinsic psychological needs</a>, and if we don\u2019t have that we will seek it out, whether it\u2019s from <a href=\"https://www.wilson.com/en-gb/blog/volleyball/true-story-wilson-volleyball\" target=\"_blank\">a volleyball for a castaway</a>, my dog, or an AI that will allow me to feel connected to something in my world.</p><p>Some people, and <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A6767\" target=\"_blank\">governments</a> for that matter, may move toward a protective stance. For instance, there are problems around what gets done with your intimate data that you hand over to an agent owned and maintained by a company\u2014that\u2019s a very reasonable concern. Dealing with the potential for children to interact, where children don\u2019t always navigate the boundaries between fiction and actuality. There are real, valid concerns. <span>However, </span><span>we need some</span><span> balance in also thinking about what</span><span> people are </span><span>getting from it that\u2019s positive, productive, healthy. </span><span>Scholars need to make sure we\u2019re being cautious about our claims based on our data. And human interactants need to educate themselves. </span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of Professor Jaime Banks aligning her fingers and palm with the hand of a humanoid robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bab58\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-professor-jaime-banks-aligning-her-fingers-and-palm-with-the-hand-of-a-humanoid-robot.jpg?id=64070474&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Jaime Banks holds a mechanical hand.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angela Ryan/Syracuse University</small></p><p><strong>Why do you think that AI companions are becoming more popular now?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: I feel like we had this perfect storm, if you will, of the maturation of large language models and coming out of COVID, where people had been physically and sometimes socially isolated for quite some time. When those conditions converged, we had on our hands a believable social agent at a time when people were seeking social connection. Outside of that, we are increasingly just not nice to one another. So, it\u2019s not entirely surprising that if I just don\u2019t like the people around me, or I feel disconnected, that I would try to find some other outlet for feeling connected.</p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>ore recently there\u2019s been a shift to embodied companions, in desktop devices or other formats beyond chatbots. How does that change the relationship, if it does?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: I\u2019m part of a Facebook group about robotic companions and I watch how people talk, and it almost seems like it crosses this boundary between toy and companion. When you have a companion with a physical body, you are in some ways limited by the abilities of that body, whereas with digital-only AI, you have the ability to explore fantastic things\u2014places that you would never be able to go with another physical entity, fantasy scenarios.</p><p>But in robotics, once we get into a space where there are bodies that are sophisticated, they become very expensive and that means that they are not accessible to a lot of people.

The IEEE Life Fellow was 97.</p><p>Chari developed a finite element method (FEM) for analyzing nonlinear electromagnetic fields\u2014which is crucial for the design of electric machines. The technique is used to obtain approximate solutions to complex engineering and mathematical problems. It involves dividing a complicated object or system into smaller, more manageable parts, known as <em><em>finite elements</em></em>, according to <a href=\"https://www.fictiv.com/articles/understanding-the-finite-element-method#:~:text=The%20Finite%20Element%20Method%20(FEM,behavior%20of%20these%20individual%20elements.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fictiv</a>.</p><p>As an engineer and technical leader at <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/about-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">General Electric</a> in Niskayuna, N.Y., Chari used the tool to analyze large turbogenerators for end region analysis, starting with 2D and expanding its use over time to quasi-2D and 3D.</p><p>During his 25 years at GE, he established a team that was developing finite element analysis (FEA) tools for a variety of applications across the company. They ranged from small motors to large <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mri\" target=\"_self\">MRI magnets</a>.</p><p>Chari received the 1993 <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-nikola-tesla-award/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Nikola Tesla Award</a> for \u201cpioneering contributions to finite element computations of nonlinear electromagnetic fields for design and analysis of electric machinery.\u201d</p><h2>A career spanning industry and academia</h2><p>Chari attended <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Imperial College London</a> to pursue a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. There he met <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_P._Silvester\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter P. Silvester</a>, a visiting professor of electrical engineering. Silvester, a professor at <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McGill University</a> in Montreal, was a pioneer in understanding numerical analysis of electromagnetic fields.</p><p>After Chari graduated in 1968, he joined Silvester at McGill as a doctoral student, applying FEM to solve electromagnetic field problems. Silvester applied the method to waveguides, while Chari applied it to saturated magnetic fields. </p><p>Chari joined GE in 1970 after earning his Ph.D. in electrical engineering. He climbed the leadership ladder and was a manager of the company\u2019s electromagnetics division when he left in 1995. He joined <a href=\"https://www.rpi.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in Troy, N.Y., as a visiting research and adjunct professor in its electrical, computer, and systems engineering department. Chari taught graduate and undergraduate classes in electric power engineering and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/advice-leading-mentoring-greater-innovation\" target=\"_self\">mentored</a> many master\u2019s and doctoral students. His strength was nurturing young engineers. </p><p>He also conducted research on electric machines and transformers for the <a href=\"https://www.epri.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electric Power Research Institute</a> and the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Energy</a>. </p><p> In 2008 Chari joined <a href=\"https://www.ndt.org/vendor.asp?ObjectID=21373\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magsoft Corp.</a>, in Clifton Park, N.Y., and conducted advanced work on specialized software for the <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Navy</a> until his retirement in 2016.</p><h2>Remembering a friend</h2><p>Chari successfully nominated one of us (Hoole) to be elevated to IEEE Fellow at the age of 40. He helped launch Haran\u2019s career when Chari sent his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to GE hiring managers for a position in its applied superconductivity lab.</p><p>Chari\u2019s commitment to people came from his family background. His father\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Ayyangar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M.A. Ayyangar</a>\u2014was known throughout India as a freedom fighter, mathematician, and eventually the speaker of the Indian Parliament\u2019s lower house under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prime Minister Nehru</a>. Chari\u2019s wife, Padma, was a physician in New York.</p><p>From Chari\u2019s illustrious family, he was at the peak of South India (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamils\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tamil</a>) society.</p><p>Chari would fondly and cheerfully tell us the story behind his name. Around the time of his birth, it was common in Tamil society not to have formal names. He went by the informal \u201chouse name\u201d Kannah (a term of endearment for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Krishna</a>). When it was time for Chari to start school, an auspicious uncle enrolled him. But Chari had no formal name, so the uncle took it upon himself to give him one. He asked Chari if he would like a long or short name, to which he said long. So the uncle named him Madabushi Venkadamachari.</p><p>When Chari moved to North America, he shortened his name to Madabushi V.K.</p><p>He could also laugh at himself.</p><p>A stellar scientist, he also was a role model, guide, and friend to many of us. We thank God for him.</p>"

They have limited energy, and mobility shouldn\u2019t consume it.\u201d</span></p><p><span>Building a mobility platform was not Hong\u2019s original ambition. Trained in optics and sensor systems, he previously worked in aerospace and robotics. From 2016 to 2019, he led the development of lidar systems for drones at Shenzhen, China-based </span><a href=\"https://www.dji.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>DJI</span></a><span>, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional drones. Hong then left DJI for a position as an assistant professor at </span><a href=\"https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Southern University of Science and Technology</span></a><span> in Shenzhen\u2014a school known for its research in robotics, human augmentation, sensors, and rehabilitation engineering.</span></p><p>However, he says, demographic trends around him proved hard to ignore. Populations in Asia, Europe, and North America are aging rapidly. More people are living longer, with limited stamina, slower reaction times, or balance challenges. So, Hong says he left academia to develop technology that would help people facing mobility limitations.</p><h3>Not a Wheelchair\u2014an EV</h3><p><span>EV<sup>1</sup> combines two lidar units, two cameras, 10 time-of-flight depth sensors, and six ultrasonic sensors.

The onboard system calculates a safe route and guides the vehicle at a reduced speed of about 3 miles per hour. The rider can override the route instantly with joystick input. The system even supports voice commands, allowing the user to direct the EV1 to waypoints saved in its memory.</p><p>The user can say, for example, \u201cGo to the fridge,\u201d and it will chart a course to the refrigerator and go there, avoiding obstacles along the way.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a screen on an electric wheelchair displaying detected obstacles in a room.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"937d0\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-screen-on-an-electric-wheelchair-displaying-detected-obstacles-in-a-room.jpg?id=64449076&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Strutt EV1 puts both joystick controls and a lidar-view of the environment in front of the device\u2019s user. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Strutt</small></p><p>Driving EV<sup>1</sup> in manual mode, the rider retains full control, with vibration feedback warning of nearby obstacles.

They may require a detailed prescription describing the features of the mobility device and why the patient\u2019s needs cannot be met with a simpler mobility aid such as a walker, cane, or standard manual wheelchair. Some states\u2019 processes include a comprehensive in-person exam, documenting how the impairment described by the clinician limits activities of daily living such as toileting, dressing, bathing, or eating.

In a demonstration, the Perseverance team <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-completes-first-ai-planned-drive-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">used AI to generate the rover\u2019s waypoints</a>. Perseverance used the AI waypoints on two separate days, traveling a total of 456 meters without human control.</span></p><p>\u201cThis demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds,\u201d said NASA Administrator <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/people/jared-isaacman/\" target=\"_blank\">Jared Isaacman</a>. \u201cAutonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It\u2019s a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations.\u201d</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"badge_module shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\">\n<a class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"Universe Today logo; text reads &quot;This post originally appeared on Universe Today.&quot;\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/universe-today-logo-text-reads-this-post-originally-appeared-on-universe-today.png?id=60568425&amp;width=1800&amp;quality=85\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>Mars is a long way away, and there\u2019s about a 25-minute delay for a round trip signal between Earth and Mars. That means that one way or another, rovers are on their own for short periods of time.</p><p>The delay shapes the route-planning process. Rover drivers here on Earth examine images and elevation data and program a series of waypoints, which usually don\u2019t exceed 100 meters apart. The driving plan is sent to <a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/dsn-now/\" target=\"_blank\">NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network</a> (DSN), which transmits it to one of several orbiters, which then relay it to Perseverance. (Perseverance can receive direct comms from the DSN as a back up, but the data rate is slower.)</p><h2>AI Enhances Mars Rover Navigation</h2><p>In this demonstration, the AI model analyzed orbital images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uahirise.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HiRISE camera</a>, as well as digital elevation models. The AI, which is based on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-ai-coding-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic\u2019s Claude AI</a>, identified hazards like sand traps, boulder fields, bedrock, and rocky outcrops. Then it generated a path defined by a series of waypoints that avoids the hazards. From there, Perseverance\u2019s auto-navigation system took over. It has more autonomy than its predecessors and can process images and driving plans while in motion.</p><p>There was another important step before these waypoints were transmitted to Perseverance. NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has a \u201ctwin\u201d for Perseverance called the \u201cVehicle System Test Bed\u201d (VSTB) in JPL\u2019s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/facilities/marsyard-iii/\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Yard</a>. It\u2019s an engineering model that the team can work with here on Earth to solve problems, or for situations like this. These engineering versions are common on Mars missions, and JPL has one for Curiosity, too.</p><p>\u201cThe fundamental elements of generative AI are showing a lot of promise in streamlining the pillars of autonomous navigation for off-planet driving: perception (seeing the rocks and ripples), localization (knowing where we are), and planning and control (deciding and executing the safest path),\u201d said Vandi Verma, a space roboticist at JPL and a member of the Perseverance engineering team. \u201cWe are moving towards a day where generative AI and other smart tools will help our surface rovers handle kilometer-scale drives while minimizing operator workload, and flag interesting surface features for our science team by scouring huge volumes of rover images.\u201d</p><h2>AI\u2019s Expanding Role in Space Exploration</h2><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\">AI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in our lives</a>, showing up in places that don\u2019t necessarily have a strong use case for it. But this isn\u2019t NASA hopping on the AI bandwagon. They\u2019ve been developing automatic navigation systems for a while, out of necessity. In fact, Perseverance\u2019s primary means of driving is its self-driving autonomous navigation system.</span></p><p>One thing that prevents fully-autonomous driving is the way uncertainty grows as the rover operates without human assistance. The longer the rover travels, the more uncertain it becomes about its position on the surface. The solution is to re-localize the rover on its map. Currently, humans do this. But this takes time, including a complete communication cycle between Earth and Mars. Overall, it limits how far Perseverance can go without a helping hand.</p><p>NASA/JPL is also working on a way that Perseverance can <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/media/documents/2024_Global_Localization_ICRA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">use AI to re-localize</a>. The main roadblock is matching orbital images with the rover\u2019s ground-level images. It seems highly likely that AI will be trained to excel at this.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious that AI is set to play a much larger role in planetary exploration. The next Mars rover may be much different than current ones, with more advanced autonomous navigation and other AI features. There are already concepts for a swarm of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mars-helicopter-ingenuity-end-mission\" target=\"_blank\">flying drones released by a rover</a> to expand its explorative reach on Mars. These swarms would be controlled by AI to work together and autonomously.</p><p>And it\u2019s not just Mars exploration that will benefit from AI. NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(Titan_space_probe)\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonfly</a> mission to Saturn\u2019s moon Titan will make extensive use of AI. Not only for autonomous navigation as the rotorcraft flies around, but also for autonomous data curation.</p><p>\u201cImagine intelligent systems not only on the ground at Earth, but also in edge applications in our rovers, helicopters, drones, and other surface elements trained with the collective wisdom of our NASA engineers, scientists, and astronauts,\u201d said Matt Wallace, manager of JPL\u2019s Exploration Systems Office. \u201cThat is the game-changing technology we need to establish the infrastructure and systems required for a permanent human presence on the Moon and take the U.S. to Mars and beyond.\u201d</p>"

A credible path to sub-$200 pricing would fundamentally alter the calculus of autonomous-car design by lowering the cost of adding precise three-dimensional sensing to mainstream vehicles. The shift reflects a broader industry trend toward solid-state lidar designs optimized for low-cost, high-volume manufacturing rather than maximum range or resolution.</p><p>Before those economics can be evaluated, however, it\u2019s important to understand what MicroVision is proposing to build.</p><p>The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://microvision.com/sensors/movia-s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Movia S</a> is a solid-state lidar. Mounted at the corners of a vehicle, the sensor sends out 905-nanometer-wavelength laser pulses and measures how long it takes for light reflected from the surfaces of nearby objects to return. The arrangement of the beam emitters and receivers provides a fixed field of view designed for 180-degree horizontal coverage rather than full 360-degree scanning typical of traditional mechanical units. The company says the unit can detect objects at distances of up to roughly 200 meters under favorable weather conditions\u2014compared with the roughly 300-meter radius scanned by mechanical systems\u2014and supports frame rates suitable for real-time perception in driver-assistance systems. Earlier mechanical lidars, used spinning components to steer their beams but the Movia S is a phased-arraysystem. It controls the amplitude and phase of the signals across an array of antenna elements to steer the beam. The unit is designed to meet automotive requirements for vibration tolerance, temperature range, and environmental sealing.</p><p>MicroVision\u2019s pricing targets might sound aggressive, but they are not without precedent. The lidar industry has already experienced one major cost reset over the past decade.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cAutomakers are not buying a single sensor in isolation... They are designing a perception system, and cost only matters if the system as a whole is viable.\u201d <strong>\u2013Glen DeVos, MicroVision</strong></p><p>Around 2016 and 2017, mechanical lidar systems used in early autonomous driving research often sold for close to $100,000. Those units relied on spinning assemblies to sweep laser beams across a full 360 degrees, which made them expensive to build and difficult to ruggedize for consumer vehicles.</p><p>\u201cBack then, a 64-beam <a href=\"https://investors.ouster.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ouster-and-velodyne-complete-merger-equals-accelerate-lidar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Velodyne</a> lidar cost around $80,000,\u201d says Radha.</p><p>Comparable mechanical lidars from multiple suppliers now sell in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. That roughly tenfold drop helps explain why suppliers now believe another steep price reduction is possible. </p><p>\u201cFor solid-state devices, it is feasible to bring the cost down even more when manufacturing at high volume,\u201d Radha says. With demand expanding beyond fully <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-vehicles\" target=\"_self\">autonomous vehicles</a> into driver-assistance applications, \u201cone order or even two orders of magnitude reduction in cost are feasible.\u201d</p><h2>Solid-State Lidar Design Challenges</h2><p>Lower cost, however, does not come for free. The same design choices that enable solid-state lidar to scale also introduce new constraints.</p><p>\u201cUnlike mechanical lidars, which provide full 360-degree coverage, solid-state lidars tend to have a much smaller field of view,\u201d Radha says. Many cover 180 degrees or less.</p><p>That limitation shifts the burden from the sensor to the system. Automakers will need to deploy three or four solid-state lidars around a vehicle to achieve full coverage. Even so, Radha notes, the total cost can still undercut that of a single mechanical unit.</p><p>What changes is integration. Multiple sensors must be aligned, calibrated, and synchronized so their data can be fused accurately. The engineering is manageable, but it adds complexity that price targets alone do not capture.</p><p>DeVos says MicroVision\u2019s design choices reflect that reality. \u201cAutomakers are not buying a single sensor in isolation,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are designing a perception system, and cost only matters if the system as a whole is viable.\u201d</p><p>Those system-level tradeoffs help explain where low-cost lidar is most likely to appear first.</p><p>Most advanced driver assistance systems today rely on cameras and radar, which are significantly cheaper than lidar. Cameras provide dense visual information, while radar offers reliable range and velocity data, particularly in poor weather. Radha estimates that lidar remains roughly an order of magnitude more expensive than automotive radar.</p><p>But at prices in the $100 to $200 range, that gap narrows enough to change design decisions.</p><p>\u201cAt that point, lidar becomes appealing because of its superior capability in precise 3D detection and tracking,\u201d Radha says.</p><p>Rather than replacing existing sensors, lower-cost lidar would likely augment them, adding redundancy and improving performance in complex environments that are challenging for electronic perception systems. That incremental improvement aligns more closely with how ADAS features are deployed today than with the leap to full vehicle autonomy.</p><p>MicroVision is not alone in pursuing solid-state lidar, and several suppliers including Chinese firms Hesai and RoboSense and other major suppliers such as Luminar and Velodyne have announced long-term cost targets below $500. What distinguishes current claims is the explicit focus on sub-$200 pricing tied to production volume rather than future prototypes or limited pilot runs.</p><p>Some competitors continue to prioritize long-range performance for autonomous vehicles, which pushes cost upward. Others have avoided aggressive pricing claims until they secure firm production commitments from automakers.</p><p>That caution reflects a structural challenge: Reaching consumer-level pricing requires large, predictable demand. Without it, few suppliers can justify the manufacturing investments needed to achieve true economies of scale.</p><h2>Evaluating Lidar Performance Metrics</h2><h2></h2><p>Even if low-cost lidar becomes manufacturable, another question remains: How should its performance be judged?</p><p>From a systems-engineering perspective, Radha says cost milestones often overshadow safety metrics.</p><p>\u201cThe key objective of ADAS and autonomous systems is improving safety,\u201d he says. Yet there is no universally adopted metric that directly expresses safety gains from a given sensor configuration.</p><p>Researchers instead rely on perception benchmarks such as <a href=\"https://www.v7labs.com/blog/mean-average-precision\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mean Average Precision</a>, or mAP, which measures how accurately a system detects and tracks objects in its environment. Including such metrics alongside cost targets, says Radha, would clarify what performance is preserved or sacrificed as prices fall.</p><p><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> has covered lidar extensively, often focusing on technical advances in scanning, range, and resolution. What distinguishes the current moment is the renewed focus on economics rather than raw capability</p><p>If solid-state lidar can reliably reach sub-$200 pricing, it will not invalidate Elon Musk\u2019s skepticism\u2014but it will weaken one of its strongest foundations. When cost stops being the dominant objection, automakers will have to decide whether leaving lidar out is a technical judgment or a strategic one.</p><p>That decision, more than any single price claim, may determine whether lidar finally becomes a routine component of vehicle safety systems.</p>"
