        "summary": "This paper explores the relationship between economic growth and the real exchange rate, specifically focusing on the convergence in price levels in Eastern European countries. While these countries have had significant convergence in GDP per capita (relative to the EU average) since the 1990s, convergence in real exchange rates for these countries stalled after the EU crisis. Using a standard theoretical framework, we estimate the main drivers of real exchange rates and show that a combination of productivity growth (Balassa-Samuelson effects) and labor market distortions help explain real exchange rate trends. We develop a structural two-country model that provides a rich decomposition of the long run determinants of the real exchange rate. Simulations based on observed sectoral productivities and labor market wedges show that the model can accurately account for the historical path of Eastern European real exchange rates, both before and after the EU crisis."

We write down an endogenous growth model with innovation step size and process efficiency as alternative sources of markup heterogeneity. Compared with the laissez-faire equilibrium, the social planner wants to reallocate research towards high step size firms but not high process efficiency firms. We then use price and productivity data across firms in French manufacturing to infer firm step sizes and process efficiency. We find that the planner could achieve faster growth by reallocating research toward high step size firms, and more so if high step size firms could freely license their innovations to high process efficiency firms."

        "summary": "Existing structural analyses of the harmful effects of market consolidation focus on either product or labor markets in isolation, ignoring that product market competitors often compete for workers as well. This paper develops a unified framework for merger evaluation, finding that firms' simultaneous exercise of oligopoly power in the product market and oligopsony power in the labor market amplifies the harm from mergers to both consumers and workers. The model also demonstrates how merger-induced gains in labor market power incentivize firms to reduce product quality, highlighting an additional channel for consumer harm. The model's predictions are tested and quantified in the context of the recent consolidation of the US hospital industry. Linking panel data from several sources on all US hospitals from 1996-2022, a difference-in-differences design is estimated for nearly 150 high-concentration within-market mergers. Hospital mergers significantly reduce patient volume, increase prices, reduce employment, lower wages, and deteriorate quality of care, resulting in higher patient mortality. After recovering the structural parameters, the estimated model replicates observed merger impacts. Counterfactual exercises reveal that ignoring increased labor (product) concentration would lead one to under-predict the harm of mergers to consumers (workers)."

This study is among the first to evaluate the program\u2019s impact on youth development outcomes in the United States. Using the Callaway and Sant\u2019Anna (2021) difference-in-differences (CSDID) estimator, we find that the DFC program significantly reduces drug-related juvenile crime and improves academic performance. The effects are particularly pronounced in communities where coalitions include government agencies, highlighting the critical role of institutional coordination in mobilizing local resources. We also explore behavioral mechanisms, documenting reductions in marijuana use and opioid-related inpatient hospitalizations. A cost-benefit analysis indicates substantial welfare gains, suggesting that early-life prevention represents a cost-effective investment in public health."

By merging collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) to linked employer-employee data in Brazil, I combine rich contracted amenities with wage information. I implement a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits a court ruling enforcing CBA continuation (i.e., ultractivity) to estimate the effects of union bargaining power. Strengthening unions raises wages and amenities without reducing employment\u2014increasing retention despite some labor-labor substitution. A revealed preference approach shows that amenities account for 45% of total compensation gains. These findings suggest that collective bargaining can offset monopsony power, but employers retain the right-to-manage workforce composition."

Even as this special generation persists, turnover among top firms has been substantial. In contrast, in retail and wholesale, we do not observe a special generation among top firms. We show in a model of firm dynamics that a special generation can arise from an industrial revolution, through the adoption of a scalable technology and learning-by-doing. Top firm turnover is matched by standard idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Time-varying market size growth rates or entry costs are not sufficient to explain the facts. Among retailers and wholesalers, learning appears absent, so a special generation would be harder to sustain. Our results highlight the potential for lasting nonstationarity among the dynamics of top firms, which can result from the long echoes of technological change."

Expecting a longer conflict leads European households to anticipate a worsening of the aggregate economy, with higher inflation, lower economic growth, and lower stock prices. They also perceive negative fiscal implications, anticipating higher government debt and higher taxes. Ultimately, households view the geopolitical conflict as making them worse off financially and it leads them to reduce their consumption."

His earliest memories are of welding with his grandfather and knitting with his grandmother\u2014unusual hobbies for a typical 4-year-old, though not in Mann\u2019s family. His father, who worked for a men\u2019s clothing company, supplemented his income by buying and renovating houses, long before the concept of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/house-flip.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flipping houses</a> became widespread.</p><p>\u201cWe were always living in a house under construction,\u201d Mann recalls. \u201cI used to help my dad fix things when I was 4 or 5\u2014hammer in my hand\u2014normal stuff.\u201d His grandfather, a refrigeration engineer, taught him how to weld. By age 6, he was wiring and building homemade radios. By the time he was 8, he had started a neighborhood repair business, fixing televisions and radios.</p><p>\u201cIn a sense, preschool for me was learning engineering and science,\u201d Mann says with a laugh. \u201cI grew up putting together wood, metal, or fabric. I knew how to make things at a very young age.\u201d</p><h2>Learning to see what others miss</h2><p>When Mann was 12 years old, his father brought home a broken oscillograph (an early version of the oscilloscope, used to display variations in voltage or current as visual waveforms). It turned out to be a defining moment in his life. Too impatient to accept that the waveform dot on the machine\u2019s display moved only up and down instead of both vertically and horizontally, Mann invented a way to push its image through physical space.</p><p>He placed the oscillograph\u2014which he now keeps on a shelf in his laboratory\u2014on a board mounted on roller skate wheels. He connected the device to a police radar and rolled it back and forth. When he realized the machine\u2019s motion, combined with the dot\u2019s vertical movement, created visible waveforms of the radar\u2019s signals, as a function of space rather than time, he unknowingly made a revolutionary discovery.</p><p>Later he would describe that merging of physical and virtual worlds as \u201cextended reality\u201d\u2014a concept that underlies today\u2019s<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-alliance-advancing-augmented-reality\" target=\"_self\"> AR</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/extended-reality\" target=\"_self\">XR</a> technologies. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time Mann\u2019s curiosity turned a problem into an opportunity.</p><p>Decades later, on the main floor of his Toronto home, he co-founded <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/pages/team\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InteraXon</a>, the Toronto-based company behind the <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqc3ta8hB6lNjQIi_jbX_Go5LphTzvrPTwE1tsykr5bg8XsWn-I\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muse brain-sensing headband</a>, used to help people manage sleep, stress, and mental health.</p><p>Mann shares legendary 1970s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/26/business/silicon-valley-tech-xerox-parc-sri.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xerox PARC</a> researcher <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kay_3972189.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kay</a>\u2019s belief that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2017/04/04/7-steps-for-inventing-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The best way to predict the future is to invent it</a>.\u201d Mann, however, adds: \u201cSometimes you invent it by simply refusing to accept the limitations of the present.\u201d</p><h2>A member of MIT\u2019s Media Lab</h2><p> In high school, Mann won several math competitions designed to challenge students at university level. In 1982 he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.mcmaster.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McMaster University</a>, in Hamilton, Ontario, to pursue a degree in engineering physics (an interdisciplinary program that combines physics, mathematics, and engineering principles). As an undergraduate, Mann was already experimenting with early prototypes of wearable computers\u2014head-mounted displays, body-worn cameras, and portable computing systems that predated mainstream mobile tech by decades.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rehmi Post, Thad Starner, Steve Mann and Professor Alex Pentland donning wearable computers that resemble electronic eyeglasses in the 1990s.

He continued his studies at McMaster to earn a second bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1989, then a master\u2019s degree in engineering in 1991.</p><p>He then enrolled in a doctoral program at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>, where he joined its renowned <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Media Lab</a>, a hotbed for unconventional research blending technology, design, and the human experience. He formalized and expanded his ideas around wearable computing, wearable computer vision systems, and wearable AI. He also published some of the earliest academic papers that described the concept of sousveillance.</p><p>He completed his Ph.D. in media arts and sciences in 1997.</p><p>Mann\u2019s doctoral research contributed foundational concepts and hardware that influenced future smart glasses and devices for life logging, the practice of creating a digital record of one\u2019s daily life. He also helped blaze a trail for the fields of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/augmented-reality-glasses-metasurface\" target=\"_self\">augmented reality</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-inescapability-of-ambient-computing\" target=\"_self\">ubiquitous computing</a>.</p><h2>Knitting passions into a unique academic career</h2><p>After completing his Ph.D., Mann returned to Canada and took a position at the University of Toronto as a professor of electrical and computer engineering in 1998. He says he is equally as fascinated by how technology interacts with the natural world as he is by how to remove barriers between the physical world and virtual world.</p><p><span>His interests connect to what he calls \u201cvironmentalism,\u201d which regards technology as a boundary between our environment and our \u201cvironment\u201d (ourselves). This gives rise to his vision of \u201cmersive\u201d technologies that link humans not just to each other but also to the environment around them.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span></span>\u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school.

He credits the organization with connecting him to pioneers like <a href=\"https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/news/simon-haykin-receives-ieee-medal-for-advancing-radar-technologies/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Haykin</a>, the radar visionary he met at McMaster while he was in high school.

He has served as an organizer, session chair, and program committee member for IEEE conferences related to wearable computing and pervasive sensing.</p><p>In 1997 he helped found the<a href=\"https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2024/iswc-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Symposium on Wearable Computers</a>, and numerous other wearable computing symposia, conferences, and events.</p><p>He has given keynote talks and presented papers on topics including sousveillance, ubiquitous computing, and other humanistic aspects of technology at the <a href=\"https://attend.ieee.org/istas-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://percom.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications</a>.</p><p>His contributions include influential papers in IEEE journals, especially various IEEE Transactions and Computer Society magazines.</p><p>Probably his most well-known paper is \u201c<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/566147\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wearable Computing</a>.\u201d Published in <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=PER300-PRT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Computer</em></em></a> magazine in October 1997, the seminal work outlined the structure and vision for wearable computing as a formal research field. He also contributed articles on sousveillance\u2014exploring the intersection of technology, ethics, and human rights\u2014in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=44\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>IEEE Technology and Society Magazine</em></em></a>.</p><p>He has collaborated with other IEEE members to develop frameworks for <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wearable computing standards</a>, particularly around human-computer interfaces and privacy considerations.</p><h2>Forever the inventor</h2><p>Mann continues to teach, run his lab, and test new frontiers of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wearables\" target=\"_self\">wearable devices</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-clothing-cornell\" target=\"_self\"> smart clothing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.xrtoday.com/mixed-reality/the-hottest-trends-in-immersive-environments-for-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">immersive environments</a>. He\u2019s still driven, he says, by the same forces that powered his backyard experiments as a child: curiosity and passion.</p><p>For students who hope to follow in his footsteps, Mann\u2019s advice is simple: \u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school. Don\u2019t define yourself by the classes you took or the jobs you had. Define yourself by what you love so much you\u2019d do it \u201ceven if no teachers or managers were demanding it\u201d. He adds that, \u201cAI can replace a walking encyclopedia. It can\u2019t replace passion.\u201d</p><p>Mann says he has no plans to retire. If anything, he says, his most productive years are yet to come.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m a late bloomer,\u201d he says, chuckling at the irony. \u201cI was fixing radios when I was 8, but my best work? That\u2019s going to happen between 65 and 85.\u201d</p>"

This was the \u201coveremployed\u201d craze, and the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/\" target=\"_blank\">/r/overemployed</a> subreddit ballooned to nearly half a million members. The dream was to earn double the income, accelerate the path to financial freedom, and subtly defy corporate America.</span></p><p>As we\u2019ve come back to physical offices, overemployment has become less common, but I was shocked when an engineer recently told me he was working two full-time jobs. He was enjoying the extra pay, but he was also stressed out about keeping secrets from both his managers. Beyond the anxiety of juggling two jobs, overemployment is clearly a career-limiting move for engineers.</p><p>Beyond the obvious contractual breaches\u2014most full-time employment agreements explicitly forbid this kind of moonlighting without consent\u2014overemployment is simply a bad idea.</p><p>With overemployment, you\u2019re essentially trying to \u201cget by\u201d in two roles. Instead of building strong relationships and genuinely contributing, you must perform a delicate balancing act, hoping neither employer catches on. This is incredibly short-sighted. Your career growth isn\u2019t about accumulating company logos; it\u2019s about the skills you acquire, the impact you make, and the people who can advocate for you. You\u2019ll grow exponentially faster\u2014and frankly, have a lot more fun\u2014 if you commit fully to one role.</p><p>The temporary financial bump of overemployment comes at a steep price; your coworkers will likely stop trusting you. This concern increases as you become more senior. At the Staff or Principal Engineer level, your <span>job</span> will depend on the relationships you\u2019ve built and your ability to work with (and through) other people. Overemployment, especially when it\u2019s a covert operation, is a fundamental violation of trust. How can you provide meaningful mentorship or truly collaborate when you\u2019re hiding a massive part of your professional life? I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible.</p><p>The ultimate career hack is quite simple: commit fully to a <span>job</span> where you\u2019re surrounded by smart coworkers in a company that\u2019s growing rapidly. This is far less complicated (and more ethical) than overemployment. This advice applies equally to engineers who believe they can do multiple personal projects alongside their full-time <span>job</span>.</p><p>The compounding effect of real skill development, strong professional relationships, and single-threaded focus will provide significantly better returns than any short-term double-dipping scheme. And it\u2019ll be more fun!</p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-map\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"What the Chips Act Looks Like Now\">What the Chips Act Looks Like Now</a></h3><p>The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 aimed to reestablish advanced manufacturing for logic and memory in the United States.

This will change many things about what\u2019s often described as the \u201cCIA triad\u201d of digital security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Of those three features, data integrity will become of paramount importance.</p><h3>Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Blue rocket launching near a tower with an explosive burst overhead.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8b9a4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blue-rocket-launching-near-a-tower-with-an-explosive-burst-overhead.png?id=61453398&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A 64-bit velocity calculation was converted to</span> a 16-bit output, causing an error called overflow. The corrupted data triggered catastrophic course corrections that forced the US $370 million rocket to self-destruct.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>When we have agency in digital spaces, we naturally maintain their integrity\u2014protecting them from deterioration and shaping them with intention. But in territories controlled by distant platforms, where we\u2019re merely temporary visitors, that connection frays. A disconnect emerges between those who benefit from data and those who bear the consequences of compromised integrity. Like homeowners who care deeply about maintaining the property they own, users in the Web 3.0 paradigm will become stewards of their personal digital spaces.</p><p>This will be critical in a world where <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-agents\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> don\u2019t just answer our questions but act on our behalf. These agents may execute financial transactions, coordinate complex workflows, and autonomously operate critical infrastructure, making decisions that ripple through entire industries. As digital agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the question is no longer whether we will trust AI but what that trust is built upon. In the new age we\u2019re entering, the foundation isn\u2019t intelligence or efficiency\u2014it\u2019s integrity.</p><h2>What Is Data Integrity?</h2><p>In information systems, integrity is the guarantee that data will not be modified without authorization, and that all transformations are verifiable throughout the data\u2019s life cycle. While availability ensures that systems are running and confidentiality prevents unauthorized access, integrity focuses on whether information is accurate, unaltered, and consistent across systems and over time.</p><h3>NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract satellite orbiting orange planet on a dark blue background with scattered dots.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"016f0\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-satellite-orbiting-orange-planet-on-a-dark-blue-background-with-scattered-dots.png?id=61453435&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br />Lockheed Martin\u2019s software calculated thrust in pound-seconds, while NASA\u2019s navigation software expected newton-seconds. The failure caused the $328 million spacecraft to burn up in the Mars atmosphere.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It\u2019s a new idea. The undo button, which prevents accidental data loss, is an integrity feature. So is the reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state. Checksums are an integrity feature; so are verifications of network transmission.</p><p>Without integrity, security measures can backfire. Encrypting corrupted data just locks in errors. Systems that score high marks for availability but spread misinformation just become amplifiers of risk.</p><p>All IT systems require some form of data integrity, but the need for it is especially pronounced in two areas today. First: Internet of Things devices interact directly with the physical world, so corrupted input or output can result in real-world harm. Second: AI systems are only as good as the integrity of the data they\u2019re trained on, and the integrity of their decision-making processes. If that foundation is shaky, the results will be too.</p><p>Integrity manifests in four key areas. The first, <em>input integrity,</em> concerns the quality and authenticity of data entering a system. When this fails, consequences can be severe. In 2021, <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook\u2019s global outage</a> was triggered by a single mistaken command\u2014an input error missed by automated systems. Protecting input integrity requires robust authentication of data sources, cryptographic signing of sensor data, and diversity in input channels for cross-validation.</p><p>The second issue is <em>processing integrity,</em> which ensures that systems transform inputs into outputs correctly. In 2003, the <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Documents/August_2003_Blackout_Final_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.\u2013Canada blackout</a> affected 55 million people when a control-room process failed to refresh properly, resulting in damages exceeding US $6 billion. Safeguarding processing integrity means formally verifying algorithms, cryptographically protecting models, and monitoring systems for anomalous behavior.</p><h3>Microsoft\u2019s Tay Chatbot (2016)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract robot illustration with orange eyes, yellow face, blue-black mouth and beige background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fca2a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-robot-illustration-with-orange-eyes-yellow-face-blue-black-mouth-and-beige-background.png?id=61454030&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Released on Twitter, Microsoft</span>\u2019s AI chatbot was vulnerable to a \u201crepeat after me\u201d command, which meant it would echo any offensive content fed to it.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><em>Storage integrity</em> covers the correctness of information as it\u2019s stored and communicated. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration was <a href=\"https://www.thestack.technology/faa-outage-cause-notam-database-file-not-cyber/\" target=\"_blank\">forced to halt</a> all U.S. departing flights because of a corrupted database file. Addressing this risk requires cryptographic approaches that make any modification computationally infeasible without detection, distributed storage systems to prevent single points of failure, and rigorous backup procedures.</p><p>Finally, <em>contextual integrity</em> addresses the appropriate flow of information according to the norms of its larger context. It\u2019s not enough for data to be accurate; it must also be used in ways that respect expectations and boundaries. For example, if a smart speaker listens in on casual family conversations and uses the data to build advertising profiles, that action would violate the expected boundaries of data collection. Preserving contextual integrity requires clear data-governance policies, principles that limit the use of data to its intended purposes, and mechanisms for enforcing information-flow constraints.</p><p>As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions with reduced human oversight, all these dimensions of integrity become critical.</p><h2>The Need for Integrity in Web 3.0</h2><p>As the digital landscape has shifted from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and now evolves toward Web 3.0, we\u2019ve seen each era bring a different emphasis in the <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad\" target=\"_blank\">CIA triad</a> of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><h3>Boeing 737 MAX (2018)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Cartoon airplane crashes into water; orange 'X' symbol above indicates failure.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8f82b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/cartoon-airplane-crashes-into-water-orange-x-symbol-above-indicates-failure.png?id=61454071&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Input integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Faulty sensor data caused a</span>n automated flight-control system to repeatedly push the airplane\u2019s nose down, leading to a fatal crash.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Returning to our home metaphor: When simply having shelter is what matters most, availability takes priority\u2014the house must exist and be functional. Once that foundation is secure, confidentiality becomes important\u2014you need locks on your doors to keep others out. Only after these basics are established do you begin to consider integrity, to ensure that what\u2019s inside the house remains trustworthy, unaltered, and consistent over time.</p><p>Web 1.0 of the 1990s prioritized making information available. Organizations digitized their content, putting it out there for anyone to access. In Web 2.0, the Web of today, platforms for e-commerce, social media, and cloud computing prioritize confidentiality, as personal data has become the Internet\u2019s currency.</p><p>Somehow, integrity was largely lost along the way. In our current Web architecture, where control is centralized and removed from individual users, the concern for integrity has diminished. The massive social media platforms have created environments where no one feels responsible for the truthfulness or quality of what circulates.</p><h3>SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack (2020)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Capitol building with skull emblem and coding patterns, symbolizing cybersecurity threats.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e236\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/capitol-building-with-skull-emblem-and-coding-patterns-symbolizing-cybersecurity-threats.png?id=61454168&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Russian hackers compromised </span>the process that SolarWinds used to package its software, injecting malicious code that was distributed to 18,000 customers, including nine federal agencies. The hack remained undetected for 14 months.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Web 3.0 is poised to change this dynamic by returning ownership to the data owners. This is not speculative; it\u2019s already emerging. For example, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol behind decentralized social networks like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, combines content sharing with built-in attribution. Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solid protocol</a> restructures the Web around personal data pods with granular access controls.</p><p>These technologies prioritize integrity through cryptographic verification that proves authorship, decentralized architectures that eliminate vulnerable central authorities, machine-readable semantics that make meaning explicit\u2014structured data formats that allow computers to understand participants and actions, such as \u201cAlice performed surgery on Bob\u201d\u2014and transparent governance where rules are visible to all. As AI systems become more autonomous, communicating directly with one another via standardized protocols, these integrity controls will be essential for maintaining trust.</p><h2>Why Data Integrity Matters in AI</h2><p>For AI systems, integrity is crucial in four domains. The first is decision quality. With AI increasingly contributing to decision-making in health care, justice, and finance, the integrity of both data and models\u2019 actions directly impact human welfare. Accountability is the second domain. Understanding the causes of failures requires reliable logging, audit trails, and system records.</p><h3>ChatGPT Data Leak (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Unlocked orange padlock with phone displaying keyhole; purple background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b856\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/unlocked-orange-padlock-with-phone-displaying-keyhole-purple-background.png?id=61454212&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A bug in </span>OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT mixed different users\u2019 conversation histories. Users suddenly had other people\u2019s chats appear in their interfaces with no way to prove the conversations weren\u2019t theirs.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The third domain is the security relationships between components. Many authentication systems rely on the integrity of identity information and cryptographic keys. If these elements are compromised, malicious agents could impersonate trusted systems, potentially creating cascading failures as AI agents interact and make decisions based on corrupted credentials.</p><p>Finally, integrity matters in our public definitions of safety. Governments worldwide are introducing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\" target=\"_self\">rules for AI</a> that focus on data accuracy, transparent algorithms, and verifiable claims about system behavior. Integrity provides the basis for meeting these legal obligations.</p><p>The importance of integrity only grows as AI systems are entrusted with more critical applications and operate with less human oversight. While people can sometimes detect integrity lapses, autonomous systems may not only miss warning signs\u2014they may exponentially increase the severity of breaches. Without assurances of integrity, organizations will not trust AI systems for important tasks, and we won\u2019t realize the full potential of AI.</p><h2>How to Build AI Systems With Integrity</h2><p>Imagine an AI system as a home we\u2019re building together. The integrity of this home doesn\u2019t rest on a single security feature but on the thoughtful integration of many elements: solid foundations, well-constructed walls, clear pathways between rooms, and shared agreements about how spaces will be used.</p><h3>Midjourney Bias (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract digital screen with colorful user icons and communication symbols.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"59897\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-digital-screen-with-colorful-user-icons-and-communication-symbols.png?id=61454522&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Contextual integrity failure</strong> <br />Users discovered that the AI image generator often produced biased images of people, such as showing white men as CEOs regardless of the prompt. The AI tool didn\u2019t accurately reflect the context requested by the users.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We begin by laying the cornerstone: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\" target=\"_self\">cryptographic verification</a>. Digital signatures ensure that data lineage is traceable, much like a title deed proves ownership. Decentralized identifiers act as digital passports, allowing components to prove identity independently. When the front door of our AI home recognizes visitors through their own keys rather than through a vulnerable central doorman, we create resilience in the architecture of trust.</p><p>Formal verification methods enable us to mathematically prove the structural integrity of critical components, ensuring that systems can withstand pressures placed upon them\u2014especially in high-stakes domains where lives may depend on an AI\u2019s decision.</p><p>Just as a well-designed home creates separate spaces, trustworthy AI systems are built with thoughtful compartmentalization. We don\u2019t rely on a single barrier but rather layer them to limit how problems in one area might affect others. Just as a kitchen fire is contained by fire doors and independent smoke alarms, training data is separated from the AI\u2019s inferences and output to limit the impact of any single failure or breach.</p><p>Throughout this AI home, we build transparency into the design: The equivalent of large windows that allow light into every corner is clear pathways from input to output. We install monitoring systems that continuously check for weaknesses, alerting us before small issues become catastrophic failures.</p><h3>Prompt Injection Attacks (2023\u20132024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Stylized blue bug on screen with keyboard; sad face in orange circle connected by line.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c6e75\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/stylized-blue-bug-on-screen-with-keyboard-sad-face-in-orange-circle-connected-by-line.png?id=61454587&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input integrity failure</strong> <br />Attackers embedded hidden prompts in emails, documents, and websites that hijacked AI assistants, causing them to treat malicious instructions as legitimate commands.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>But a home isn\u2019t just a physical structure, it\u2019s also the agreements we make about how to live within it. Our governance frameworks act as these shared understandings. Before welcoming new residents, we provide them with certification standards. Just as landlords conduct credit checks, we conduct integrity assessments to evaluate newcomers. And we strive to be good neighbors, aligning our community agreements with broader societal expectations.</p><p>Perhaps most important, we recognize that our AI home will shelter diverse individuals with varying needs. Our governance structures must reflect this diversity, bringing many stakeholders to the table. A truly trustworthy system cannot be designed only for its builders but must serve anyone authorized to eventually call it home.</p><p>That\u2019s how we\u2019ll create AI systems worthy of trust: not by blindly believing in their perfection but because we\u2019ve intentionally designed them with integrity controls at every level.</p><h2>A Challenge of Language</h2><p>Unlike other properties of security, like \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cprivate,\u201d we don\u2019t have a common adjective form for \u201cintegrity.\u201d This makes it hard to talk about it. It turns out that there is a word in English: \u201cintegrous.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recorded the word used in the mid-1600s but now <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/integrous_adj?tab=factsheet&amp;tl=true#210671\" target=\"_blank\">declares it obsolete</a>.</p><h3>CrowdStrike\u00a0Outage (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Three panels: people on escalator, government building, hospital with red cross flag.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"031f4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-panels-people-on-escalator-government-building-hospital-with-red-cross-flag.png?id=61454608&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Processing integrity failure</strong><br />A faulty software update from CrowdStrike caused 8.5 million Windows computers worldwide to crash\u2014grounding flights, shutting down hospitals, and disrupting banks.

We need the ability to describe a system with integrity. We must be able to talk about integrous systems design.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><p>Ensuring integrity in AI presents formidable challenges. As models grow larger and more complex, maintaining integrity without sacrificing performance becomes difficult. Integrity controls often require computational resources that can slow systems down\u2014particularly challenging for real-time applications. Another concern is that emerging technologies like quantum computing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2668949802\" target=\"_self\">threaten current cryptographic protections</a>. Additionally, the distributed nature of modern AI\u2014which relies on vast ecosystems of libraries, frameworks, and services\u2014presents a large attack surface.</p><p>Beyond technology, integrity depends heavily on social factors. Companies often prioritize speed to market over robust integrity controls. Development teams may lack specialized knowledge for implementing these controls, and may find it particularly difficult to integrate them into legacy systems. And while some governments have begun establishing regulations for aspects of AI, we need worldwide alignment on governance for AI integrity.</p><h3>Voice-Clone Scams (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"People holding phones, speech bubble showing happiness, money, and skull emoji.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"26ea5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/people-holding-phones-speech-bubble-showing-happiness-money-and-skull-emoji.png?id=61454716&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input and processing integrity failure</strong><br />Scammers used AI-powered voice-cloning tools to mimic the voices of victims\u2019 family members, tricking people into sending money. These scams succeeded because neither phone systems nor victims identified the AI-generated voice as fake.<br /></p><p><span>Addressing these challenges requires sustained research into verifying and enforcing integrity, as well as recovering from breaches. Priority areas include fault-tolerant algorithms for distributed learning, verifiable computation on encrypted data, techniques that maintain integrity despite adversarial attacks, and standardized metrics for certification. We also need interfaces that clearly communicate integrity status to human overseers.</span></p><p>As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the stakes for integrity have never been higher. We are entering an era where machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous agents will operate with reduced human oversight and make decisions with profound impacts.</p><p>The good news is that the tools for building systems with integrity already exist. What\u2019s needed is a shift in mind-set: from treating integrity as an afterthought to accepting that it\u2019s the core organizing principle of AI security.</p><p>The next era of technology will be defined not by what AI can do, but by whether we can trust it to know or especially to do what\u2019s right. Integrity\u2014in all its dimensions\u2014will determine the answer. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Usually, they want to write an article for us. But one bold query I received in January 2024 went much further: An undergraduate engineering student named <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatosin-kolade/?originalSubdomain=ng\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oluwatosin Kolade</a>, from Obafemi Awolowo University, in Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300, Nigeria, volunteered to be our robotics editor. </p><p>Kolade\u2014Tosin to his friends\u2014had been the newsletter editor for his IEEE student branch, but he\u2019d never published an article professionally. His earnestness and enthusiasm were endearing. I explained that we already have a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/evan-ackerman\" target=\"_self\">robotics editor</a>, but I\u2019d be glad to work with him on writing, editing, and ultimately publishing an article. </p><p> Back in 2003, I had met plenty of engineering students when I traveled to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\">Nigeria to report </a>on the SAT-3/WASC cable, the first undersea fiber-optic cable to land in West Africa. I remember seeing students gathering around obsolete PCs at Internet caf\u00e9s connected to the world via a satellite dish powered by a generator. I challenged Tosin to tell <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> readers what it\u2019s like for engineering students today. The result is \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Lessons from a Janky Drone</a>.\u201d</p><p>I decided to complement Tosin\u2019s piece with the perspective of a more established engineer in sub-Saharan Africa. I reached out to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/g-pascal-zachary\" target=\"_self\">G. Pascal Zachary</a>, who has covered engineering education in Africa for us, and Zachary introduced me to <a href=\"https://ibaino.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Engineer Bainomugisha</a>, a computer science professor at Makerere University, in Kampala, Uganda. In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/africa-engineering-hardware\" target=\"_blank\">Learning More With Less</a>,\u201d Bainomugisha draws out the things that were common to his and Tosin\u2019s experience and suggests ways to make the hardware necessary for engineering education more accessible.</p><p>In fact, the region\u2019s decades-long struggle to develop its engineering talent hinges on access to the three things we focus on in this issue: reliable electricity, ubiquitous broadband, and educational resources for young engineers.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cDuring my weekly video calls with Tosin...the connection was pretty good\u2014 except when it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p><span>Zachary\u2019s article in this issue, \u201c</span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electricity-access-sub-saharan-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What It Will Really Take to Electrify All of Africa</a><span>\u201d</span><span> tackles the first topic, with a focus on an ambitious initiative to bring electricity to an additional 300 million people by 2030.</span></p><p> Contributing editor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/lucas-laursen\" target=\"_self\">Lucas Laursen</a>\u2019s article, \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/broadband-internet-in-nigeria\" target=\"_blank\">In Nigeria, Why Isn\u2019t Broadband Everywhere?</a>\u201d investigates the slow rollout of fiber-optic connectivity in the two decades since my first visit. As he learned when he traveled to Nigeria earlier this year, the country now has eight undersea cables delivering 380 terabits of capacity, yet less than half of the population has broadband access. </p><p>I got a sense of Nigeria\u2019s bandwidth issues during my weekly video calls with Tosin to discuss his article. The connection was pretty good, except when it wasn\u2019t. Still, I reminded myself, two decades ago such calls would have been nearly impossible. </p><p>Through those weekly chats, we established a professional connection, which made it that much more meaningful when I got to meet Tosin in person this past May at the <a href=\"https://2025.ieee-icra.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE ICRA robotics conference</a>, in Atlanta. Tosin was attending thanks to a scholarship from the <a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</a>. Like a kid in a candy shop, he kibbutzed with fellow scholarship winners, attended talks, checked out robots, and met the engineers who built them. </p><p>As Tosin embarks on the next leg in his career journey, he is supported by the IEEE community, which not only recognizes his promise but gives him access to a network of professionals who can help him and his cohort realize their potential.</p>"

Instead, it handed operational control to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p><p><a href=\"https://natcast.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Natcast</a> was created in 2023 to oversee the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), which the law established to conduct \u201cresearch and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology and grow the domestic semiconductor workforce to strengthen the economic competitiveness and security of the domestic supply chain.\u201d </p><p>The nonprofit was contracted to receive a total of US $7.4 billion, in annual payments and when the organization reaches milestones. But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lutnick\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> claimed that Natcast doesn\u2019t meet certain legal requirements, and therefore the contract, inked less than a week before Donald J. Trump took office for the second time, is illegal. </p><p>Several NSTC proponents whom <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> spoke to are concerned that the move could squander U.S. semiconductor leadership in the long term. The goal of the NSTC, those involved say, is to make gains in semiconductors from the CHIPS Act durable through continued advances. </p><h2>Semiconductor Workforce Development</h2><p>Since its establishment, Natcast has been working to bring up three <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nstc\" target=\"_self\">key centers to execute those functions</a>. In Silicon Valley, it\u2019s established a workforce development and design enablement center. In New York, it opened a center for<a href=\"https://natcast.org/grand-opening-nstc-euv-accelerator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> extreme-ultraviolet lithography for cutting edge chipmaking</a>. And in Arizona, it plans to build a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/third-chips-for-america-rd-flagship-facility-announced\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">prototyping and packaging facility</a>. The centers are intended to help startups and other companies more easily bridge the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">lab-to-fab gap</a> that currently prevents new technologies from making it into commercial products.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThere were people from day one\u2026who viewed [Natcast] as very much a political entity and wanted to undo it.\u201d </p><p>The CHIPS Act requires that the NSTC be operated as a \u201cpublic private-sector consortium with participation from the private sector\u201d instead of by a government agency. During the Biden administration, the Commerce Department created Natcast to fill that role, deliberately setting it up in a way to help maintain its independence from political interference. </p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Natcast-CEO-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public letter</a> to Natcast CEO <a href=\"https://natcast.org/deirdre-hanford-ceo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deirdre Hanford</a>, Lutnick cast the actions of Hanford, her staff, and the volunteer advisors involved in the organization\u2019s creation as giving \u201cthe appearance of impropriety\u201d and flouting \u201cfederal law.\u201d \u201cFrom the very beginning Natcast served as a semiconductor slush fund that did nothing but line the pockets of Biden loyalists with American tax dollars,\u201d he said in a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/department-commerce-takes-action-against-biden-administrations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>.</p><p>(<em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> sought additional comment from the Commerce Department and from Natcast but did not receive a reply by press time.)</p><p>Very little funding has actually been delivered, sources say, in part because Commerce has held up its dispersal. (Despite this, NSTC does have a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jay-lewis-1108361_natcast-nist-natcast-activity-7362847657897205761-tEE3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAolpgBG1d7OiKsbIW43dxd6SSv0dyPEgA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of accomplishments</a>.) Lutnick\u2019s legal argument for refusing payment now is that Natcast wasn\u2019t established in accordance with the Government Corporation Control Act, which lays out how government agencies establish or purchase corporations. </p><p>One person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named says that the structure of Natcast is typical of public-private partnerships and that its underpinnings were thoroughly reviewed by the Commerce Department before its establishment. What\u2019s really at issue, this person says, is Natcast\u2019s independence.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhat was set up\u2026 was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026. I think all of that has gone away with this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were people from day one\u2026who viewed [Natcast] as very much a political entity and wanted to undo it,\u201d says this person.</p><p>In the letter, Lutnick takes aim at <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipient/deirdre-hanford/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hanford</a>, formerly a top executive at electronic design automation giant <a href=\"https://www.synopsys.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Synopsys</a>, as well as at Natcast staffers who came over from government during the Biden administration or from a volunteer <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/09/us-department-commerce-appoints-first-members-industrial-advisory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industrial advisory committee</a> that included IEEE Fellows and other chip industry leaders. Targeting such people is concerning, says one expert who preferred not to be named, because chip experts who choose to work in government or at Natcast are usually giving up more lucrative work to serve their country. It has the effect of \u201cpunishing patriotic behavior,\u201d the expert said.</p><p>Delaying the work of the NSTC by attacking Natcast is counterproductive for the U.S. chip industry, the expert added. \u201cWe are in a race, and these delays make it all the more urgent.\u201d</p><p>Commerce will likely find some way to spend the money on semiconductor R&amp;D eventually, sources agreed. One expert told <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> they have faith in NIST\u2019s ability to administer the research funding. Mark Granahan, an early proponent of the CHIPS Act and CEO of<a href=\"https://idealsemi.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Ideal Semiconductor</a>, in Bethlehem, Penn., went further. \u201cIf the administration has a different tactic but the same goal\u2026 not just independence in semiconductors but leadership\u2026 then NIST and other existing infrastructure is capable of handling things,\u201d he said.</p><p>But other sources were skeptical it would have the same impact as Natcast. \u201cWhat was set up\u2026 was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind,\u201d said one person. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026. I think all of that has gone away with this decision.\u201d</p><p><em>This post was updated on 26 August 2025 to remove mention of NSTC\u2019s September Symposium, which is now cancelled.</em></p>"

Within just a few years, dial-up had exited my life, never to return.

At the end of September, it\u2019s gone. The timeline is almost <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2020/10/13/eternal-september-modern-impact/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on-the-nose fitting</a>: The widespread access to the Internet AOL\u2019s service brought in the 1990s is associated with a digital phenomenon called the Eternal September. Before AOL allowed broad access to Usenet\u2014a precursor to today\u2019s online discussion forums\u2014most new users appeared each September, when new college students frequently joined the platform. Thanks to AOL, they began showing up daily starting around September 1993.</p><p>The fact that AOL\u2019s dial-up is still active in the first place highlights a truism of technology: Sometimes, the important stuff sticks around well after it\u2019s obsolete.</p><h3>Why AOL is ditching dial-up now</h3><p>It\u2019s no surprise that dial-up has lingered for close to a quarter-century. Despite not having needed a dial-up modem myself since the summer of 2001, I was once so passionate about dial-up that I begged to get a modem for my 13th birthday. Modems are hard to shake, and not just because we fondly remember waiting so long for them to do their thing.</p><p>Originally, the telephone modem was a hack. It was pushed into public consciousness <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Phone_of_Our_Own/4bgvh1lTQwcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA30&amp;printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partly by Deaf users</a> who worked around the phone industry\u2019s monopolistic regulations to develop <a href=\"https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/telephone-and-relay-services/tty-and-tty-relay-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the teletypewriter</a>, a system to communicate over phone lines via text. Along the way, the community invented technologies like the acoustic coupler.</p><p>To make that hack function, modems had to do multiple conversions in real time\u2014from data to audio and back again, in two directions. As I put it in a piece that <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/06/28/teletype-computer-evolution-history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">compared the modem to the telegraph</a>:</p><blockquote>The modem, at least in its telephone-based forms, represents a dance between sound and data. By translating information into an aural signal, then into current, then back into an aural signal, then back into data once again, the modulation and demodulation going on is very similar to the process used with the original telegraph, albeit done manually.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A retro rectangular modem that says U.S. Robotics Sportster 33.6 Faxmoden\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e814a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-retro-rectangular-modem-that-says-u-s-robotics-sportster-33-6-faxmoden.jpg?id=61508670&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Modems like this one from U.S. Robotics work by converting data to audio and back again. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Robotics_33.6K_Modem.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Jphill19/Wikimedia Commons</a></small></p>With telegraphs, the information was input by a person, translated into electric pulses, and received by another person. Modems work the same way, just without human translators. <p>The result of all this back and forth was that modems had to give up a hell of a lot of speed to make this all work. The need to connect over a medium built for audio meant that data was at risk of getting lost over the line. (This is why <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2021/01/06/error-correcting-code-memory-history/\" target=\"_blank\">error correction</a> was an essential part of the modem\u2019s evolution; often data needed to be shared more than once to ensure it got through. Without error correction, dial-up modems would be even slower.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Remember that sound? It marked many users\u2019 first experience getting online.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dudJjUU9Nhs&amp;t=2s\" target=\"_blank\">AdventuresinHD/YouTube</a></small></p><p>Telephone lines were a hugely inefficient system for data because they were built for voice and heavily compressed audio. Voices are still clear and recognizable after being compressed, but audio compression can wreak havoc on data connections. </p><p>Plus, there was the problem of line access. With a call, you could not easily share a connection. That meant you couldn\u2019t make phone calls while using dial-up, leading to some homes getting a second line. And at the Internet Service Provider level, having multiple lines got very complex, very fast.</p><p>The phone industry knew this, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/01/12/isdn-history-retrospective/\" target=\"_blank\">but its initial solution, ISDN</a>, did not take off among mainstream consumers. (A later one, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/inventor-of-dsl-altered-connectivity\" target=\"_blank\">DSL</a>, had better uptake, and is likely one of the few Internet options rural users currently have.)</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">In some areas of the United States, dial-up remains the best option\u2014the result of decades of poor investment in Internet infrastructure.</p><p>So the industry moved to other solutions to get consumers Internet\u2014<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ethernet-ieee-milestone\" target=\"_blank\">coaxial cable</a>, which was already widespread because of cable TV, and fiber, which wasn\u2019t. The problem is, coax never reached quite as far as telephone wires did, in part because cable television wasn\u2019t technically a utility in the way electricity or water were. </p><p><span>In recent years, many attempts have been made to classify </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/covid19-makes-clear-broadband-access-is-human-right\" target=\"_blank\">Internet access as a public utility</a><span>, though the most recent one was </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5247840/net-neutrality-fcc-struck\" target=\"_blank\">struck down by an appeals court</a><span> earlier this year. </span><span>The public utility regulation is important. The telephone had struggled to reach rural communities in the 1930s, and only did so after a series of regulations, including </span><a href=\"https://www.frs.org/history-rural-telecommunications\" target=\"_blank\">one that led to the creation</a><span> of the Federal Communications Commission, were put into effect. So too did electricity, which </span><a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2020/q1/economic_history\" target=\"_blank\">needed a dedicated law</a><span> to expand its reach.</span></p><p>But the reach of broadband is frustratingly incomplete, as highlighted by the fact that many areas of the country are not properly covered by cellular signals. And getting new wires hung can be an immensely difficult task, in part because companies that sell fiber, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/verizon-nears-the-end-of-fios-builds/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon</a> and Google, often stop investing due to the high costs. (Though, to Google\u2019s credit, <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/blog/2022/08/whats-next-for-google-fiber.html\" target=\"_blank\">it started expanding again in 2022</a> after a six-year rollback.)</p><p>So, in some areas of the United States, dial-up remains the best option\u2014the result of decades of poor investment in Internet infrastructure. This, for years, has propped up companies like AOL, which has evolved numerous times since it foolishly merged with Time Warner a quarter-century ago.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A screenshot showing a 1994 DOS AOL client\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4112a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-showing-a-1994-dos-aol-client.jpg?id=61508672&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The first PC-based client called America Online appeared on the graphical operating system GeoWorks. This screenshot shows the DOS AOL client that was distributed with GeoWorks 2.01.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ernie Smith</small></p><p>But AOL is not the company it was. After multiple acquisitions and spin-outs, it is now a mere subsidiary of Yahoo, and it long ago transitioned into a Web-first property. Oh, it still has <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/products\" target=\"_blank\">subscriptions</a>, but they\u2019re effectively fancy analogues for unnecessary security software. And their email client, while having been defeated by the likes of Gmail years ago, still has its fans. </p><p>When I posted the AOL news on social media, about 90 percent of the responses were jokes or genuine notes of respect. But there was a small contingent, maybe 5 percent, that talked about how much this was going to screw over far-flung communities. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s AOL\u2019s responsibility to keep this model going forever.</p><p>Instead, it looks like the job is going to fall to two companies: Microsoft, whose <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/msn-dial-up-internet-access/CFQ7TTC0KGVG/\" target=\"_blank\">MSN Dial-Up Internet Access</a> costs US $179.95 per year, and the company <a href=\"https://www.unitedonline.net/company/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">United Online</a>, which still operates the longtime dial-up players Juno and NetZero. Satellite Internet is also an option, with older services like HughesNet and newer ones like Starlink picking up the slack.</p><p>It\u2019s not AOL\u2019s fault. But AOL is the face of this failing.</p><h3>AOL dropping dial-up is part of a long fade-out</h3><p>As technologies go, the dial-up modem has not lasted quite as long as the telegram, which has been active in one form or another for 181 years. But the modem, which was first used in 1958 as <a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/about/history/sage-semi-automatic-ground-environment-air-defense-system\" target=\"_blank\">part of an air-defense system</a>, has stuck around for a good 67 years. That makes it one of the oldest pieces of computer-related technology still in modern use.</p><p>To give you an idea of how old that is: 1958 is also the year that the <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2018/01/25/soldering-technology-history/\" target=\"_blank\">integrated circuit</a>, an essential building block of any modern computer, was invented. The disk platter, which became the modern <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2022/02/18/early-hard-drive-history/\" target=\"_blank\">hard drive</a>, was invented a year earlier. The <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/11/17/3m-floppy-disks-history/\" target=\"_blank\">floppy disk</a> came a decade later.</p><p>(It should be noted that the modem itself is not dying\u2014your smartphone has one\u2014but the connection your landline has to your modem, the really loud one, has seen better days.)</p><p>The news that AOL is dropping its service might be seen as the end of the line for dial-up, but the story of the telegram hints that this may not be the case. In 2006, much hay was made about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2006/02/02/5186113/western-union-sends-its-last-telegram\" target=\"_blank\">Western Union sending its final telegram</a>. But Western Union was never the only company sending telegrams, and another company picked up the business. You can still send a telegram via <a href=\"https://itelegram.com\" target=\"_blank\">International Telegram</a> in 2025. (It\u2019s not cheap: A single message, sent the same day, is $34, plus 75 cents per word.)</p><p>In many ways, AOL dropping the service is a sign that this already niche use case is going to get more niche. <span>But niche use cases have a way of staying relevant, given the right audience. It\u2019s sort of like why doctors continue to use pagers. As </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1197955913/doctors-pagers-beepers\" target=\"_blank\">a Planet Money episode</a><span> from two years ago </span>noted<span>, the additional friction of using pagers worked well with the way doctors functioned, because it ensured that they knew the messages they were getting didn\u2019t compete with anything else.</span></p><p>Dial-up is likely never going to totally die, unless the landline phone system itself gets knocked offline, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/12/04/att-eliminate-traditional-landline-copper-phone-service-2029/76765766007/\" target=\"_blank\">which AT&amp;T has admittedly been itching to do</a>. It remains one of the cheapest options to get online, outside of drinking a single coffee at a Panera and logging onto the wifi.</p><p>But AOL? While dial-up may have been the company\u2019s primary business earlier in its life, it hasn\u2019t really been its focus in quite a long time. AOL is now a highly diversified company, whose primary focus over the past 15 years has been advertising. It still sells subscriptions, but those subscriptions are about to lose their most important legacy feature.</p><p>AOL is simply too weak to support the next generation of Internet service themselves. Their inroad to broadband was supposed to be Time Warner Cable; that didn\u2019t work out, so they pivoted to something else, but kept around the legacy business while it was still profitable. It\u2019s likely that emerging technologies, like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/airband-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft\u2019s Airband Initiative</a>, which relies on distributing broadband over unused \u201cwhite spaces\u201d on the television dial, stand a better shot. 5G connectivity will also likely improve over time (T-Mobile <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-brings-5g-home-internet-to-nearly-five-million-more-homes\" target=\"_blank\">already promotes its 5G home Internet</a> as a rural option), and perhaps more satellite-based options will emerge.</p><p>Technologies don\u2019t die. They just slowly become so irrelevant that they might as well be dead.</p><h3>The monoculture of the AOL login experience</h3><p>When I posted the announcement, hidden in an obscure link on the AOL website sent to me by a colleague, it immediately went viral on Bluesky and Mastodon.</p><p>That meant I got to see a lot of people react to this news in real time. Most had the same comment: I didn\u2019t even know it was still around. Others made modem jokes, or talked about AOL\u2019s famously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vO8OpbCvs\" target=\"_blank\">terrible customer service</a>. What was interesting was that most people said roughly the same thing about the service.</p><p>That is not the case with most online experiences, which usually reflect myriad points of views. I think it speaks to the fact that while the Internet was the ultimate monoculture killer, the experience of getting online for the first time was largely monocultural. Usually, it started with a modem connecting to a phone number and dropping us into a single familiar place. <span></span></p><p>We have lost a lot of Internet Service Providers over the years. Few spark the passion and memories of America Online, a network that somehow beat out more innovative and more established players to become the onramp to the Information Superhighway, for all the good and bad that represents.</p><p>AOL must be embarrassed of that history. It barely even announced its closure.</p>"

IPF is a chronic disease that develops when lung tissue becomes too thick, causing permanent scarring in the lungs, according to the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>. The condition makes it hard to breathe. Despite numerous hospital visits and CT scans, her grandfather was diagnosed with the condition too late, leading al-Mahrouqi to want to improve IPF diagnosis methods.</p><p>\u201cRadiologists look for things like tiny, honey-shaped complex sites or faint, hazy areas called ground-glass opacities in the lungs,\u201d al-Mahrouqi says. \u201cThese same patterns also show up in other diseases, like nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and early-stage lung cancer. This often leads to a misdiagnosis.\u201d</p><p>She developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system that uses a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization process, enhancing CT images by amplifying contrast and limiting image grain. Her prototype also uses six different pretrained convolutional neural networks that classify fibrosis patterns and nodule types\u2014malignant, benign, or normal\u2014to provide an earlier diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cThis prototype is unique because it converts classification and enhancement into a single diagnostic tool,\u201d al-Mahrouqi says.

Encased in titanium, the batteries for these devices contained a radioactive isotope\u2014typically about a tenth of a gram of plutonium-238\u2014and could operate for decades without maintenance. The invention provided relief to a population of people who previously needed surgery every few years to change out their pacemaker\u2019s chemical battery.</p><p>As time went on, though, the whereabouts of these radioactive tickers became increasingly difficult to track. In the United States, the devices were supposed to be returned to the U.S. Department of Energy for plutonium recovery. But often, that didn\u2019t happen. Doctors changed jobs, manufacturers went out of business, patients died, and families forgot about their loved one\u2019s pacemaker. Too often, the radioactive material landed in crematoriums and coffins.</p><p>Uncomfortable with the situation, regulators worldwide nixed the devices. The last known nuclear-powered pacemaker was implanted in 1988. After that, aside from a few specialty uses, such as deep-space probes and Siberian lighthouses, development and deployment of nuclear batteries effectively came to a halt.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Two human hands using instruments to manipulate the pieces of a small metal object labeled as radioactive\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cea8b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Medtronic\u2019s 1970 Laurens-Alcatel pulse generator powered pacemakers with plutonium-238. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Smith Collection/Getty Images </small></p><p>Technology never truly dies, and nuclear batteries are no exception. Research <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-daintiest-dynamos\" target=\"_self\">grew active again after 2000</a>, although it lacked commercial translation. But over the last year, a host of companies and research groups around the world have announced advances that they say will invigorate the technology and extend its use to robots, drones, sensors, and solar farms, as well as spacecraft and biomedical implants.</p><p>The new groups are employing modern, more-exotic technology that goes beyond the designs of the past, allowing them to pursue the finest nuclear batteries ever made. As with the first generation, the allure of nuclear batteries is still their extraordinarily long life-spans: several decades and, with proper fuel choice, possibly centuries. They could also deliver more energy in packages that weigh less than those of chemical batteries.</p><p>The question is, who\u2019s going to buy them? I\u2019ve been involved in this sector for nearly 40 years as a nuclear engineer, professor, and consultant. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed: The technology works, it has many advantages over chemical batteries, and it can be utilized safely. But what very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. Part of the problem is that there is no good solution to the need to track these sources and make sure they are disposed of properly at the end of the battery\u2019s life.</p><p>There are more companies working out the challenges now than I\u2019ve ever seen in my career, and that\u2019s good for the field\u2014it helps ground the academic research. And it gives me hope that this could be the moment when nuclear batteries finally flourish.</p><h2>How Do Nuclear Batteries Work?  </h2><p>The term \u201cnuclear batteries\u201d may evoke images of tiny nuclear reactors, but that\u2019s not how they work. Nuclear batteries don\u2019t split atoms with neutron bombardment. Instead, they capture energy in the form of radiation that\u2019s spontaneously released when atomic nuclei decay.</p><p>Most research groups developing nuclear batteries are focused on harnessing energy from radioactive isotopes of nickel and hydrogen. In many nuclear battery designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation released by the radioisotopes\u2019 nuclei and convert it to an electric current, much like a solar cell does. In other designs, thermoelectric devices convert the heat produced by the emitted radiation to electricity. So \u201cradioisotope power source\u201d is a better descriptor than \u201cnuclear battery,\u201d but for ease of language, I\u2019ll use these terms interchangeably.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A coin-shaped metal object displaying a radioactive symbol and other details about its contents \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7d529\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Infinity Power uses a novel electrochemical process to convert the radioactive decay of nickel-63 into electricity. The company says it can scale the technology from microwatts to megawatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Infinity Power </small></p><p>On the heels of some laboratory successes, researchers are racing to commercialize these devices. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority\" target=\"_blank\">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> (UKAEA), Miami-based <a href=\"https://citylabs.net/\" target=\"_blank\">City Labs</a>, Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co., and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nwnu.edu.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">Northwest Normal University</a> have all announced advances and funding in semiconductor-based nuclear batteries over the last two years, some with plans to commercialize. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.infinitypower.energy/\" target=\"_blank\">Infinity Power</a>, in San Diego, announced a novel electrochemical approach to converting radioisotope energy.</p><p>What markets these batteries will find\u2014if they can be commercialized\u2014will depend largely on cost, safety, and licensing issues. One of the most compelling applications is in uncrewed spacecraft for long-distance missions, which require decades of reliable power. Solar power works for missions close to the sun, but by the time a spacecraft gets to Jupiter, the available solar irradiance drops below 4 percent of that on Earth.</p><p>That leaves nuclear fission and radioisotope power as the only viable options for deep-space missions. Fission is ideal for larger power needs in space, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-nuclear-reactor-nasa-moon?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=hero&amp;utm_campaign=2025-08-22&amp;utm_content=hero1\" target=\"_blank\">like NASA\u2019s proposed 100-kilowatt lunar nuclear reactor</a>. But for lower, onboard power needs, nuclear batteries offer simpler designs and lower mass. The current radioisotope workhorse in space is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, which produces a few hundred watts.</p><h2>Radioisotopes: Not Just for Nuclear-Powered Pacemakers </h2><p>NASA\u2019s two Voyager missions, launched in 1977, each carry three RTGs that weigh about 38 kilograms, including 4.5 kg of plutonium-238. They\u2019re cylindrical and about the size of an office wastebasket. They initially produced 157 watts of electric power, but that drops over time as the plutonium-238 decays. A 157-W Voyager-based RTG that launched in 1977 will produce about 88 W today.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Two cylindrical metal machines stacked on top of each other in a cinder block room\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"607f2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p>Another good use for nuclear batteries is to supply power in remote locations on Earth. Beginning in the 1970s, for example, the Soviet Union deployed over 1,000 RTGs in northwestern Russia to power its uncrewed lighthouses, radio beacons, and weather stations. Most of these batteries ran on strontium-90, and each weighed about 2,000 kg. The United States has deployed hundreds of similar systems for remote power both on land and on the ocean floor, particularly for <a href=\"http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/ota-bp-eti-129.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remote monitoring sites in the Arctic</a>.</p><p>While nuclear batteries have proved successful for space exploration, remote power, and pacemakers, no new uses for these long-lived batteries have emerged. Many devices would benefit from long-lived batteries\u2014imagine a wireless tire pressure sensor that lasts the life of a car, for example. But the risks and costs of opting for a radioactive battery would have to be balanced against the benefits.</p><p>Another factor working against the widespread use of nuclear batteries is the need to track the fuel. In just about any country, the sellers and buyers of any such batteries intended for the general public would need to be licensed (see box, \u201cBoy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale\u201d). The buyer also typically takes on the burden of tracking and disposing of the material. Keeping tabs on radioactive material is a necessity, but this adds complexity to applications involving the general public.</p><h3>Boy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale</h3><br /><p>In just about any country, buyers of radioisotope fuel sources must be licensed\u2014with some exceptions. In the United States, for example, you don\u2019t need a license for some radioisotopes if the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part030/part030-0071.html\" target=\"_blank\">quantity is below a certain level</a> set by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Many smoke detectors contain about 1 microcurie, or 37,000 becquerels, of americium-241, which is below the exception limit of 5 \u00b5Ci (185,000 Bq). (The radioisotope ionizes the air within the detector, and the alarm is triggered when the presence of smoke alters the ionization rate.)</p><p>The exemption quantities are too small for even the smallest nuclear battery\u2014unless someone starts up a collection. That\u2019s just what <a href=\"https://inis.iaea.org/records/vpjmt-6nz83\" target=\"_blank\">a young man in Michigan</a> in the 1990s did. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he attempted to build a neutron generator by collecting americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping-lantern mantles, radium from old clocks, and tritium from gunsights. He amassed so much radioactive material that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared his home a Superfund hazardous waste clean-up site.</p><p>But the benefits of radioisotopes are profound, and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to use them with proper care. They\u2019re used worldwide on a daily basis primarily for medical imaging and cancer therapy. They\u2019re also used as tracers to monitor fluid flow and detect leaks, for nondestructive inspection of welds, and for explosive detection.\u2014J.B.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>One new use where the benefits may outweigh the risks and costs is providing longer-lived power to soldiers\u2014something the U.S. military has explored. Soldiers\u2019 missions often take them to remote or unstable locations where electricity may be unavailable, preventing them from charging their equipment. This forces soldiers to carry batteries, the weight and life of which limit their missions. Small nuclear batteries would provide a lightweight alternative\u2014potentially 1/100 the weight\u2014due to their higher energy density relative to that of chemical batteries. But they would need to be encased to shield soldiers from the radiation, and designed to withstand harsh conditions, which would add weight.</p><p>Another potential new use for nuclear batteries is to power autonomous sensors or robots that communicate, move, or fly. One compelling use would be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-robot-2671447539\" target=\"_self\">insect-size flying microdrones</a> for civilian and military purposes. But collecting them at the end of their flights might be difficult and would also leave tiny bits of radioactive material littering the landscape.</p><h2>Engineering Challenges: Betavoltaics Versus Alphavoltaics</h2><p>Let\u2019s turn to the engineering challenges of commercializing a miniature nuclear battery. In general, taking a promising battery technology from the lab to mass production is a complex process that\u2019s more likely to end in failure than success. With nuclear batteries, it involves negotiating a lot of trade-offs between cost, power, safety, and life-span.</p><p>First, you have to pick the fuel\u2014that is, an isotope of an element that will release radiation as it decays. Such isotopes emit three types of radiation: gamma rays, beta particles, and alpha particles. Gamma rays are short-wavelength electromagnetic waves that can travel deep into most solids, including living tissue. They\u2019re difficult to contain and capture, so gamma-emitting isotopes are typically avoided.</p><h3>Table 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u00a0</h3><br /><table border=\"0\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Isotope</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Type</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Maximum decay energy<br />(kiloelectron volt)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\"> Half-life (year)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Specific power (watts per gram)</th></tr><tr><td> Tritium</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">19</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">12.3</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.33</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Carbon-14</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">156</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,730</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.0013</td></tr><tr><td>Nickel-63</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">67</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">100</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.0058</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Promethium-147</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">225</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">2.6</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.41</td></tr><tr><td>Polonium-210</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">5,305</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.38</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">141</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Plutonium-238</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,593</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">87.7</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.56</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"photo-credit\">Credit/source: Jake Blanchard</p><p class=\"caption\">Radioisotopes emit particles with a spectrum of energies. The decay energy is a measure of the kinetic energy of emitted particles as the radioisotope decays. The specific power provided here is a measure of how much power an ideal, pure radioisotope source can generate per unit of mass at the beginning of its life.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Pure beta or alpha emitters are a better choice for nuclear batteries. Beta particles are electrons that have an intermediate penetration range in solids. Their decay energies go from a few kiloelectron volts (for tritium, or hydrogen-3) to a few megaelectron volts (for yttrium-90). Alpha particles, by contrast, are emitted at a higher energy than beta particles\u2014typically around 5 MeV\u2014and can\u2019t penetrate a piece of paper. But they can damage semiconductors by creating defects as they collide with the nuclei in the device. This makes alpha emitters best suited for non-semiconductor battery technologies that convert the heat generated by the source fuel into electricity.</p><p>Radioisotopes of nickel, carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, promethium, polonium, and plutonium all emit beta or alpha particles and are good options for nuclear batteries (see \u201cTable 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u201d). Which one to choose depends on several factors, including the isotope\u2019s half-life and its decay energy.</p><p>For the longest battery life, you\u2019ll want a radioisotope with a long half-life, because the battery\u2019s output power will drop by a factor of two over each half-life. That means a tritium-fueled device will lose half its power every 12 years, while a plutonium-238 battery will lose half its power every 88 years.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>What very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If your goal is instead to maximize the battery\u2019s power density\u2014such as for an insect-size microdrone\u2014then you\u2019ll need one with a short half-life<strong>.</strong> For example, polonium-210 has a half-life of a few months, but a power density of 141 watts per gram, which could give it enough power to carry its payload. The short half-life would mean it would work only for a few months and would completely decay within a couple of years. But for a microdrone that will probably be abandoned somewhere, perhaps that\u2019s a good thing. (Note that these power densities account for thermal power, but there are losses in converting to electricity, so the output power density of any devices created using this fuel will be lower.)</p><p>The safest nuclear battery fuels are tritium and nickel-63, because they produce low-energy beta particles that are easier to shield and less damaging to semiconductors than alpha particles. Pure tritium can be challenging to work with because it\u2019s a gas at room temperature. It can be converted into a metal hydride, but this process, which involves mixing it with stable isotopes, decreases its energy density. Another design consideration is that the lower penetration depth of these safer, low-energy <a href=\"https://blanchard.engr.wisc.edu/purebeta.htm\" target=\"_blank\">beta emitters</a> requires that the sources be made very thin, or else the particles will never reach the battery\u2019s semiconductor.</p><p>What about supply and cost? All radioisotopes are expensive to procure and are typically only available in small quantities. Just about any of them can be made during nuclear fission by placing a dedicated target material in the reactor core. They can also be made using particle accelerators. Some types of radioisotopes can be obtained from spent nuclear fuel. But none of these options is simple or inexpensive, because every step requires the handling of radioactive materials.</p><p>One gram of tritium costs about US $30,000 and will produce a thermal power of about 0.3 W, which would in turn typically produce an electric power of only a few milliwatts. The supply of plutonium-238 is so limited that NASA must set its launch schedule according to the availability of the fuel. As a result, NASA is pursuing americium-241 as an alternative. It\u2019s unclear how these costs would change if the market for these materials grows substantially.</p><h2>How to Convert Radioisotope Power Sources</h2><p>After choosing a fuel, you have to select a conversion technology. Early radioisotope power sources developed in the 1950s simply collected the charged decay particles, producing an electric potential difference between the collector and the source\u2014that is, a voltage\u2014that could then be tapped to produce electricity. The current in these designs was inherently low, and so the battery had to be run at a high voltage (in the kilovolts) to achieve a reasonable conversion efficiency, which proved too challenging.</p><p>To get around this problem, you can use a semiconductor to turn each charged particle emitted by the source into thousands of charge carriers, allowing the device to run at a few volts instead of a few kilovolts. The physics of such a device is essentially that of a solar cell, except that the source of the radiation is from a radioisotope instead of the sun. When the radioisotope is a beta-particle emitter, we call the device \u201cbetavoltaic.\u201d</p><h3>Three Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u00a0</h3><br /><p><span>As radioactive isotopes decay, their nuclei spontaneously release energy in the form of radiation</span>. The energy can be captured, converted into electricity, and stored, creating a nuclear battery. In common designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation and convert it to an electric current, or thermoelectric devices convert the heat that radioisotopes produce to electricity. But more-exotic techniques such as radioluminescent, thermionic, and thermophotovoltaic conversion are also being explored.  </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of light and energy transfer from radioactive to photovoltaic systems.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09f7f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-light-and-energy-transfer-from-radioactive-to-photovoltaic-systems.png?id=61488113&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Radioluminescent conversion</strong></p><p>In this approach, a scintillator, such as a cerium-doped lutetium aluminum crystal, is exposed to ionizing radiation from the isotope, causing it to emit light. The light is captured and converted to electricity with a photovoltaic cell, which can be tuned to the frequency of the emitted light to improve conversion efficiency. But the light production itself is inefficient.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of a heat engine showing heat flow and electron movement in a plasma-filled gap.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7136b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-a-heat-engine-showing-heat-flow-and-electron-movement-in-a-plasma-filled-gap.png?id=61488106&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermionic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This concept uses the radioisotope to produce a hot surface (typically above 1,500</span> \u00b0C), which then releases electrons via thermionic emission. The source is heated as the emitted particles deposit their kinetic energy in the solid through interactions with the source atoms. The electrons emitted by the surface can be collected to produce a potential and a current source. Conversion efficiency can reach 20 percent, but achieving the necessary temperatures requires large sources, so this technology is only appropriate for high-power applications. </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Heat-to-electricity conversion diagram using thermophotovoltaic (TPV) technology.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"49131\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/heat-to-electricity-conversion-diagram-using-thermophotovoltaic-tpv-technology.png?id=61488098&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermophotovoltaic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This strategy uses </span>a radioisotope to produce a hot surface, and electromagnetic radiation from the hot surface produces electricity within a photovoltaic cell. To obtain good efficiencies, these devices must run very hot\u2014around 2,000\u00b0C for a conversion efficiency of 29 percent.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Under development since the 1950s, betavoltaic batteries feature a radioactive emitter and a silicon-diode absorber. As the emitter naturally decays, electrons (in the form of beta particles) strike the absorber. This creates a cascade of electron-hole pairs, which occur when electrons are removed from their original position, leaving a \u201chole\u201d that generates a small but stable supply of electric current. This process is similar to that of a solar cell, where light produces the electron-hole pairs.</p><p>Betavoltaic batteries with silicon diodes have conversion efficiencies of a few percent, and up to 10 percent with silicon carbide, and can typically operate at around 1 volt. Some models indicate that this <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9936597\" target=\"_blank\">efficiency can be as high as 23.5 percent</a>. Recent research on betavoltaics uses diamond semiconductors, which offer even higher conversion efficiencies due to their higher bandgap.</p><p>Betavoltaics are solid-state, simple, and relatively inexpensive, so they offer an ideal way to produce a low-power option (less than about a milliwatt) for nuclear batteries. They can be used to create higher-power devices, but in those cases it\u2019s often better to switch to an alpha emitter to achieve a higher power density. However, because the alpha particles will damage a semiconductor, their use generally requires a conversion option that relies on heat converted to electricity.</p><p>For example, NASA uses thermoelectric conversion in its RTGs, which have been used to power not only <em>Voyager 1</em> and <em>2</em>, but also two Mars rovers and over <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rps-fleet.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">40 other NASA missions</a>. If you\u2019ve seen the movie <em>The Martian</em>, you may recall how Matt Damon\u2019s character, trapped alone on Mars, used an RTG: He needed a heat source to stay warm while traveling in a rover, so he dug up an old RTG from a previous mission and placed it inside his vehicle.</p><p>To convert the heat to electricity, the RTGs employ a series of thermocouples, which consist of a junction of two dissimilar conductors. These components produce a potential in the presence of a temperature gradient (via what\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/how-does-a-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-rtg-work-the-seebeck-effect/#:~:text=The%20scientist%2C%20Thomas%20Seebeck%2C%20found,of%20compounds%20known%20as%20semiconductors.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seebeck</a> effect). The pacemakers of the 1970s also relied on thermoelectric conversion, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p>Other, more-exotic conversion techniques include radioluminescent conversion, thermionic conversion, and thermophotovoltaic conversion (see sidebar, \u201cThree Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u201d), all of which work well in the lab but require higher operating temperatures or have degradation issues. Most companies are focused on developing betavoltaic technology because it permits the use of the safer beta emitters.</p><h2>Who Is Developing Nuclear Batteries?</h2><p>Since the invention of small betavoltaic power sources in the 1970s, the vast majority of research on nuclear batteries has focused on power levels of less than 1 microwatt (see \u201cTable 2: Who\u2019s Developing Nuclear Batteries\u201d). To date, many of these efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.betavolt.tech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</a> says it has a 100-\u00b5W battery that\u2019s about the size of a cereal square (15 by 15 by 5 millimeters) and can last 50 years. The company is working with betavoltaics using nickel-63, tritium, promethium-147, and strontium-90, and a diamond semiconductor to convert the energy to electricity.</p><h3>Table 2: Who\u2019s Developing Nuclear Batteries\u00a0\u00a0</h3><br /><table border=\"1\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">        Company/research group (location)</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Radioisotope</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">        Conversion technology</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Goals and accomplishments</th></tr><tr><td>Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</td><td>Nickel-63</td><td>Betavoltaic with diamond diode semiconductor</td><td>100-microwatt battery; planning a 1-watt version for commercial launch</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\"><a href=\"https://www.arkenlight.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> Arkenlight</a> (Bristol, England)</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Carbon-14 and tritium</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Betavoltaic with diamond diode semiconductor</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Exploring use in satellites, medical implants, industrial sensors, and luxury watches</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.dgist.ac.kr/eng/index.do\" target=\"_blank\"> Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology</a> (Daegu, South Korea)</td><td>Carbon-14</td><td>Betavoltaic with titanium dioxide semiconductor sensitized with ruthenium dye</td><td>Presented results at American Chemical Society spring meeting, March 2025</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\"><a href=\"https://citylabs.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> City Labs</a> (Miami)</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Tritium</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Betavoltaic</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Focused on space, deep ocean, and medical applications; 20-year battery life</td></tr><tr><td>Northwest Normal University (Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China) and <a href=\"http://www.beitalab.com/company.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wuxi Beita Pharmatech</a> Co.

Potential applications include aerospace, medical implants, wearable devices, MEMS systems, advanced sensors, small drones, miniature robots, law-enforcement equipment, and fire-safety remote communication.</p><p>Assuming Beijing Betavolt\u2019s device has a conversion efficiency of about 5 percent, the battery would have to hold about 20 curies, or 740 billion becquerels (0.4 grams), of nickel-63. This is well above the typical amount of nickel-63 available on the market, which is normally in the millicurie range.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">To date, many efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p>Infinity Power also uses nickel-63 in its coin-size battery, but may need less of it because of the novel electrochemical conversion process it has developed. The company says its conversion efficiency exceeds 60 percent\u2014about six times as efficient as the best radioisotope power generators.</p><p>In Infinity\u2019s design, the isotope is dissolved or suspended in a proprietary liquid electrolyte. The decay of the radioisotope produces high-energy beta particles that ionize the electrolyte, creating a potential difference between the anode and cathode immersed in the solution and driving electron flow through an external circuit to produce electricity.</p><p>Academic and government researchers are also pursuing nuclear batteries. The University of Bristol, in England, and the UKAEA last year announced they had developed a battery fueled by carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. With carbon-14\u2019s half-life of 5,700 years, the battery could theoretically last for millennia. The U.K. has an ample supply of the fuel because it can be scavenged from the country\u2019s graphite-moderated, gas-cooled fission reactors. Carbon-14 produces beta particles with a maximum energy of 156 kiloelectron volt, which should be low enough to prevent damage to the battery\u2019s diamond semiconductor.</p><p>Meanwhile, a collaboration of researchers in China published a report in the December 2024 <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science</em></em> on a <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709846/authors#authors\" target=\"_blank\">radioluminescent nuclear battery</a>. The team used an X-ray source, which emits electromagnetic radiation, to mimic a beta source, which emits electrons, to help them understand how the device might perform. The X-ray photons excited two inorganic scintillators, causing them to emit light, and a commercial silicon photodiode converted the light to electricity.</p><p>The products envisioned by these startups offer great promise. The key to their lasting success will be identifying markets in which the benefits of nuclear batteries outweigh the challenges. The market for these devices in space applications is strong, but whether new markets will arise remains to be seen. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Yu-Tzu Chiu, who contributed reporting for this article.</em></p>"

We had developed a new class of quantum dots\u2014nanoscale particles of light-emitting semiconductor material that can be used in displays, solar cells, and more. Our technology was safer, more stable, and less expensive than <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-dots-nobel-prize\" target=\"_self\">existing quantum-dot materials</a>. The technical advantages were real, but I quickly learned that no amount of scientific merit guarantees market success.</p><p>For many tech-startup founders, this is an uncomfortable but necessary realization. You can build an elegant solution, but if it doesn\u2019t solve a meaningful problem in the market, it won\u2019t go anywhere commercially. The earlier you embrace that lesson, the better your odds of success.</p><h2>Your Invention Isn\u2019t the Business</h2><p>My background is in research. I have a Ph.D. in materials science from the <a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois\u2013Urbana-Champaign</a>, and I did a postdoc at <a href=\"https://www.lanl.gov/engage/organizations/cels/chemistry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Los Alamos</a>, in New Mexico, working on nanomaterials in the chemistry division. My focus was always on advancing scientific knowledge, publishing papers, and in some cases filing patents. Like many researchers, I eventually grew tired of chasing citations and wanted to apply that work to the real world.</p><p>That\u2019s why I started <a href=\"https://www.ubiqd.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UbiQD</a>. We had a material that solved the technical shortcomings of conventional quantum dots, which require toxic heavy metals like cadmium or lead and involve expensive manufacturing processes. However, when we first introduced it to the market, the conversations we had were eye-opening. People didn\u2019t care about the material for its own sake. They cared about whether it solved their problem, and the severity of the problem defined their urgency.</p><p>My advice: If you can\u2019t clearly explain how your technology makes someone\u2019s life easier, safer, more sustainable, or more profitable, you\u2019re not ready to sell it. </p><h2>\u201cThrowing It Over the Fence\u201d Doesn\u2019t Work</h2><p>Our early thinking was overly simplistic: Create better quantum dots, scale production, and let customers apply the technology to the industries that benefit from quantum dots\u2019 ability to manipulate light. We figured, if we make it, the customers will come. </p><p>To speed things up, we offered research-grade samples for testing. A number of early adopters asked for samples, but that \u201cthrow it over the fence\u201d approach <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/when-innovation-moves-too-fast\" target=\"_self\">typically doesn\u2019t work</a> with a novel enabling technology. Whether it\u2019s advanced materials, hardware, or software, you can\u2019t expect customers to figure out what solution works best; that\u2019s your job. </p><p>So before scaling your tech, spend time with potential customers. Listen more than you talk and identify their true pain points. Ask them what keeps them up at night. That\u2019s where the real opportunities lie: in the chances to provide a must-have painkiller, rather than a nice-to-have daily vitamin.</p><h2>Shelve the Ideas That Don\u2019t Fit</h2><p>One of the hardest lessons tech founders must learn is how to recognize when a beloved idea doesn\u2019t align with market needs. </p><p>Take <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-dawn-of-solar-windows\" target=\"_self\">solar windows</a> for greenhouses, one of the ideas we thought would be a hit but then had to shelve. Greenhouses spend a lot on electricity, so it seemed logical that they\u2019d want to generate electricity directly in the facade of the greenhouse. However, growers told us their biggest concern was crop yield, not operational costs. Light-absorbing windows could potentially cause a slight reduction in yield, and any such reduction\u2014even with energy savings\u2014would likely hurt their bottom line.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>That\u2019s where the real opportunities lie: in the chances to provide a must-have painkiller, rather than a nice-to-have daily vitamin.</span></p><p>So we paused the solar-window idea in 2018 and focused instead on a simpler, higher-impact product: greenhouse <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-dots-shift-sunlights-spectrum-to-speed-plant-growth\" target=\"_self\">films that shift the color of light</a> to help plants grow faster. The growers cared about yield, and that\u2019s what we addressed using our technology. This agricultural application is now one of UbiQD\u2019s main focus areas. </p><p>Don\u2019t get emotionally attached to one application or use case. If your company is built on a platform technology, stay flexible. The market will tell you where your technology fits\u2014and where it doesn\u2019t. </p><h2>Competition Means You\u2019re on the Right Track</h2><p>Many founders dread competition. I see it differently. When we entered the agriculture space, we saw other startups and a few large companies exploring similar ideas. That wasn\u2019t discouraging. It was validating. If no one else is working on the problem, it might not be a worthwhile opportunity. </p><p>Some startups also try to stay under the radar to gain an edge. But if potential partners or early customers don\u2019t know you\u2019re working on a problem, they can\u2019t contribute to, challenge, or help accelerate your solution. That said, differentiation matters. Our edge comes from robust intellectual property, technical depth, and years of hard-earned data. We\u2019ve had lots of help and input from outside the company, and some of our best customers found us first.</p><p>Expect and embrace competition, and don\u2019t be shy about it. Just make sure you have a defendable advantage\u2014whether through technology, partnerships, data, or expertise.</p><h2>Earn the Right to Expand</h2><p>As you begin to succeed in one market, you\u2019ll be tempted to expand quickly to others. But be cautious about moving too quickly. We\u2019ve turned down plenty of tempting market opportunities over the years because we hadn\u2019t earned the right to go after them yet.</p><p>For example, applying our materials to cosmetics or paints is exciting, but until we achieved sufficient production scale and cost reduction, it didn\u2019t make sense economically. Now that we\u2019ve lowered costs and built better infrastructure, those markets are back on the table, but we understood this only <em><em>after</em></em> studying potential customers and their needs.</p><p>Build scale and generate revenue in your first market, and only then explore adjacent opportunities. </p><h2>Advice I Wish I Had Heard Earlier</h2><p>If I could give my younger self just one piece of advice, it would be this: Fall in love with the problem first, then the solution.</p><p>As a tech-company founder, I spent years perfecting our technology and publishing papers about how great the science of the solutions is. Building a company, though, also means understanding your customers and the economics of solving their problems.</p><p>Science and engineering are critical, but so are customer discovery, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/product-management-career\" target=\"_self\">product management</a>, and market research. Those skills are essential, and you\u2019ll probably need them sooner than you think.</p><p>So get out of the lab. Talk to potential customers as early as possible. Be ready to adapt as you listen. And remember, the value of your technology comes from the problem it solves.</p>"

This model dates from the 1930s, when such radios came in gorgeous wooden cabinets. The specimen I stumbled on was still in the possession of the original owner, who used to listen to it with her family when she was a little girl. The wood and speaker fabric were nicely preserved, probably looking much as they when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. I snatched it up.</p><p>I knew at the very least I\u2019d need to <a href=\"https://antiqueradio.org/recap.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">replace a bunch of capacitors</a>. But after scrutinizing the underside of the chassis, I realized I\u2019d be doing a lot more, as much of the original wire insulation had disintegrated.

The chief piece of wisdom was \u201cBe careful.\u201d Even when new, electronics of the vacuum-tube era could be dangerous. Being the cautious type, I wanted to take all appropriate safety measures.</p><p>In particular, when working with tube-era electronics, you should resist the urge to just plug it in to see if it works. Decades-old paper and electrolytic capacitors are almost <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vintage-audio-repair\" target=\"_self\">guaranteed to be bad</a>. And much else could be amiss as well. Instead, make the repairs and upgrades you determine are needed first. Even then, don\u2019t just plug in your relic and flip the power switch. Better to start it up gently to look for signs of trouble.</p><h2>How Does a Dim-Bulb Tester Work?</h2><p>But how do you turn on old equipment gently? That concept was foreign to me, having grown up in the transistor era. And this is when I learned about dim-bulb testers. They take advantage of the fact that the resistance of an ordinary incandescent light bulb increases markedly as the filament heats up. The tester sits between your device and the wall plug. The bulb is wired in series to the power line and acts as a current limiter: Even if a component or wire in your device fails and causes a short, the current flowing into the device won\u2019t exceed the current that would normally flow through the bulb. You can control the maximum current by using bulbs of different wattages.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Key components for the dim bulb tester\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b839d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/key-components-for-the-dim-bulb-tester.png?id=61517921&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Caption: Because the dim-bulb tester relies on an incandescent bulb [top middle], a certain retro look is guaranteed. I leaned into this aesthetic by using vintage analog meters [top left and right], and having a metal front panel custom-made by a sign maker [bottom].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Sure, you can cobble together such a tester using just an outlet box, a lamp base, and a switch. But I decided to go all out on the safety front and build a more fully featured dim-bulb tester, something akin to <a href=\"https://www.stagecue.com/variac.html\" target=\"_blank\">a design that I saw online</a> that includes a variable transformer along with panel meters to monitor voltage and current. And for fun, I decided to give my tester a vintage look.</p><p>I hunted on eBay for vintage bits and pieces (or ones that could pass as vintage). While the effort to make my tester look old increased the cost and slowed construction, I was beginning to like the idea of restoring old electronics as a new hobby, so I figured: Why not?</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vintage-audio-repair\" target=\"_self\">Turn a Vintage Hi-Fi Into a Modern Entertainment Center</a></p><p>The end result was a unit that included two<a href=\"https://www.triplett.com/pages/overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Triplett</a> analog panel meters that, best I can figure out, date from shortly after the Second World War. It also includes three indicator lights that must be from the 1950s. They adorn a front panel that I fabricated by ordering<a href=\"https://www.signs.com/aluminum/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> a custom aluminum sign</a> and cutting the openings using hole saws.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An electronic schematic.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fc4bb\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-electronic-schematic.png?id=61517931&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The dim-bulb tester allows me to ramp up the voltage applied to old equipment. The resistance of the bulb prevents damaging current flows to the equipment while looking for any signs of troublet.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Choosing the proper enclosure for my ersatz test instrument was one of the bigger challenges. Large enclosures tend to be expensive, and I also struggled to find something that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place in the TV repair shops of my youth. The solution was to purchase a damaged vintage test instrument (a<a href=\"https://www.crowave.com/blog/2019/07/23/signal-generator-eico-model-315/\" target=\"_blank\"> tube-equipped signal generator</a>), pull the chassis out, and use its painted steel enclosure. I bought it for less than I would\u2019ve paid for a new enclosure. I also bought a small collection of incandescent light bulbs of different wattages. Assembling my tester was straightforward.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t quite done, though. In my investigations into how repair vintage electronics safely, I learned about using an isolation transformer to help protect against shocks. I toyed with the idea of building one into my dim-bulb tester\u2019s enclosure, but I decided it was more practical to purchase a stand-alone unit. I got a used one for a good price, but it took some work to fix and modify it so that it truly isolated the input from the output. (Oddly enough, commercial units don\u2019t typically offer full isolation\u2014you have to<a href=\"https://www.radioradar.net/en/measurements_technics/vintage_tube_radio_restoration.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> mod them for this</a>.) I figure that I can just plug my device into my dim-bulb tester, plug the tester into the isolation transformer, then plug the transformer into the wall.</p>With my completed tester ready to go, I carefully examined the wiring and components of my Majestic radio and ordered what I think I\u2019ll need to fix it. I\u2019ve just received the box of components from <a href=\"https://www.mouser.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mouser</a>, so repair and live testing will begin shortly. I should add that while working on my dim-bulb tester, I couldn\u2019t resist making another $50 antique-radio purchase: a Zenith AM/FM tabletop radio from the late 1950s. The person I bought it from said that it works, but I now know there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to verify that assertion. So I\u2019ve got plenty to keep me busy in my newfound hobby\u2014along with the gear I need to pursue it safely."

The idea for the karaoke machine didn\u2019t come from a singer or a large entertainment company but from <a href=\"https://nichiden-kogyo.co.jp/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nichiden Kogyo</a>, a small electronics assembly company in Tokyo.</p><p>The company\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeichi_Negishi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shigeichi Negishi</a>, was singing to himself at work one day in 1967 when an employee jokingly told him he was out of tune. Figuring that singing along to music would help him stay on pitch, Negishi began thinking about how to make that possible. He had the idea to turn one of the 8-track tape decks his company manufactured into what is now known as the karaoke machine.</p><p>Later that year, he built what would become the first such machine, which he called the Music Box. The 30-centimeter cube housed an 8-track player for four tapes of instrumental recordings and included a microphone to sing into.</p><p>He sold his machine in 1967 to a Japanese trading company, which then sold it to restaurants, bars, and hotel banquet halls, where they used it as entertainment.</p><p>The machine was coined <em><em>karaoke</em></em> in the 1970s to describe the act of singing along to prerecorded music. The term is a combination of two Japanese words: <em><em>kara</em></em>, meaning <em><em>empty</em></em>, and <em><em>okesutora</em></em>, meaning <em><em>orchestra</em></em>.</p><p>In a few years, dedicated establishments known as karaoke bars began to open across Japan. Today the country has more than 8,000, according to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/10306/karaoke-industry-in-japan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a>.</p><p>The karaoke machine has been commemorated as an <a href=\"https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Main_Page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Milestone</a>. The dedication ceremony was held in June in the area that houses karaoke booths connected to the <a href=\"https://www.princehotels.com/shinagawa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shinagawa Prince Hotel</a> in Tokyo. Negishi\u2019s family attended the event along with IEEE leaders. Negishi died last year at the age of 100.</p><p>He was grateful that people enjoy karaoke around the world, his son, Akihiro Negishia, said at the ceremony, \u201cthough he didn\u2019t imagine it to spread globally when he created it.\u201d</p><h2>Accidentally inventing one of the world\u2019s favorite pastimes</h2><p>Shigeichi Negishi grew up in Tokyo, where his mother ran a tobacco store and his father oversaw regional elections as a government official. After earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from <a href=\"https://www.global.hosei.ac.jp/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hosei University</a> in Tokyo, he was drafted into the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Imperial Japanese Army</a> during World War II. He became a prisoner of war and spent two years in Singapore before being released in 1947.</p><p>He returned to Tokyo and sold cameras for electrical parts manufacturer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Corporation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Olympus Corp</a>. In 1956 he started Nichiden Kogyo, which manufactured and assembled portable radios for the home and car, according to the <a href=\"https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:First_Karaoke_Machine,_1967\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Engineering and Technology History Wiki entry</a> about the karaoke machine.</p><p>Negishi would start each morning singing along to the \u201cPop Songs Without Lyrics\u201d radio show, according to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2025/06/23/advancing-technology-for-the-pursuit-of-happiness/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Forbes</em></em></a> article. He typically didn\u2019t sing in the office, but one fateful day he did. Negishi was inspired to engineer one of the 8-track tape decks his company manufactured into what is now known as the karaoke machine</p><p>An 8-track tape deck can play and record audio using magnetic tape cartridges. Nichiden Kogyo\u2019s Music Box was a 30-centimeter cube with slots to insert four 8-track tapes on the top panel, with control buttons to play, stop, or skip to the next song.</p><p>Inside each 13-centimeter-long rectangular 8-track cartridge is a loop of almost 1 cm-wide magnetic tape that is coiled around a circular reel, as explained in an <a href=\"https://everpresent.com/when-did-the-8-track-come-out/#:~:text=Inside%20each%208%20track%20tape,tracks%20for%20sale%20on%20Google\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EverPresent blog post on the technology</a>. A small motor inside each cartridge pulls the tape across an audio head inside the player, which reads the magnetic patterns and translates them into sound. Each tape had a metal sensing strip that notified a solenoid coil located in the player when a song had ended or if a person pressed the button to switch to the next song, according to an <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/8-Track-Walkman-Pod-thing-Retro-tech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Autodesk Instribules blog post</a>. The coil created a magnetic field when electricity passed through it\u2014which rotated the spindle on which the audio head was mounted to move to the next track on the tape. Each tape could hold about eight songs.</p><p>Negishi added a microphone amplifier to the player\u2019s top panel, as well as a mixing circuit. The user could adjust the volume of the music and the microphone.</p><p>He also recorded 20 of his favorite songs onto the tapes and printed out the lyrics on cardstock. He tested the machine by singing a popular ballad, \u201cMujo no Yume\u201d (\u201cThe Heartless Dream\u201d).</p><p>\u201cIt works! That\u2019s all I was thinking,\u201d Negishi told reporter <a href=\"https://www.mattalt.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Alt</a> years later, when asked what his thoughts were the first time he tested the Music Box.
