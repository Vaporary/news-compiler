Using new micro-data on the U.S. economy in 1860, we document that where free and enslaved workers live and how much they earn correlates strongly\u2014but differently\u2014with geographic proxies for agricultural productivity, disease, and ease of slave escape. To explain these patterns, we build a quantitative spatial model of slavery, where slaveholders coerce enslaved workers into supplying more labor, capture the proceeds of their labor, and assign them to sectors and occupations that maximize owner profits rather than worker welfare. Combining theory and data, we then quantify how dismantling the institution of slavery affected the spatial economy. We find that the economic impacts of emancipation are substantial, generating welfare gains for the enslaved of roughly 1,200%, while reducing welfare of free workers by 0.7% and eliminating slaveholder profit. Aggregate GDP rises by 9.1%, with a contraction in agricultural productivity counteracted by an expansion in manufacturing and services driven by an exodus of formerly enslaved workers out of agriculture and into the U.S. North."

        "summary": "This study uses fiscal gap accounting (FGA) and generational accounting (GA) to compare US and Italian fiscal solvency. FGA and GA incorporate all government outlays and receipts, whether put on or kept off the books. FGA measures, in the form of reduced net outlays, the constant share of each future year\u2019s GDP needed to balance the government\u2019s intertemporal budget. GA calculates the lifetime net tax rate \u2013 lifetime taxes divided by lifetime labor earnings -- facing future generations if current generations pay nothing more, on net, than current policy mandates. Deficit accounting suggests that Italy\u2019s 135 percent debt-to-GDP ratio places it in worse fiscal shape than the US with its 123 percent ratio. But on a fiscal-gap basis, Italy appears in far better shape regardless of the discount rate used. Based on the theoretically appropriate rate \u2013 the average real return to national wealth, the U.S. fiscal gap is 7.4%. Italy\u2019s is 4.0%. These requisite solvency adjustments are far larger if delayed or if the UN\u2019s more pessimistic demographic projections prevail. Neither country can expect future generations, on their own, to cover their government\u2019s red ink. Doing so requires levying lifetime net tax rates, in each country, that exceed 100%."

However, firms may not fully internalize the financial benefits from investing in employee skill-building, which can disincentivize worker training and suggest roles for government support. We examine such tradeoffs in the context of physician training (i.e., \u201cresidency\u201d programs). Using the universe of Medicare inpatient and outpatient records from 2014-2019 and differences-in-differences analyses, we show that hospitals\u2019 productivity and revenues grow by 10-20% after underwriting a procedure-oriented residency\u2013\u2013though heterogeneity exists. The hospitals benefiting from trainee labor conservatively net over $2 million in steady-state, revealing substantive private incentives to finance physician training."

        "summary": "Research shows responsive caregiving enhances children's brain development, with parental knowledge predicting positive behaviors and outcomes. However, knowledge varies widely across educational levels, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. Despite evidence that this knowledge can be improved, no comprehensive metric exists for efficient assessment. We introduce SPEAK (Survey of Parent/Provider Expectations and Knowledge), a computer-adaptive tool grounded in item-response theory that we created, to address this gap by measuring parental and educator knowledge across development domains with precision and speed. This paper details SPEAK's development, including domain construction, cognitive interviewing, expert review, psychometric calibration, and validity evidence. SPEAK offers a flexible, scalable solution for clinical, educational, research, and policy settings. By identifying knowledge gaps, it enables tailored interventions, supports professional development, and informs policy, ultimately improving parent-child interactions and child outcomes. Our tool bridges critical gaps in assessing child development knowledge, advancing research and cross-sector collaboration to promote early childhood development worldwide."

Female physicians reduce their office visits by 85% in the quarter after giving birth, but return nearly to pre-birth levels within two years. These supply disruptions generate persistent effects on child patients: those whose primary care physician gives birth are less likely to see their usual physician for up to two years and receive less preventative care, including a 50% reduction in vaccination claims and a 42% reduction in lead testing. In contrast, we find little impact on adult patients. The lasting effects on children coincide with fewer pediatrician encounters overall, consistent with limited availability of substitute providers and the central role of pediatricians in monitoring children\u2019s preventative care. Our findings demonstrate how shocks to women\u2019s labor supply can generate persistent consumer welfare losses."

We discuss the background fundamentals in place at the outset of the Great Inflation and document the distinct phases of inflation, the unique features of the UK\u2019s experience relative to other advanced economies, and the interplay between fiscal, monetary, and incomes policies. By placing the UK\u2019s inflationary episodes within their institutional and historical context, this paper offers a qualitative perspective that complements the quantitative analysis of the main paper and informs ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of persistent inflation."

        "summary": "Despite a large earnings premium for bachelor\u2019s degree completion in general, graduates from low-income families earn substantially less than graduates from high-income families. While prior research has documented the role of college quality and major choice in explaining these gaps, we examine undermatching on a different margin: the first (post-college) job transition. The transition from college to the labor market can be challenging to navigate, and students with financial, informational, or other disadvantages during the job search may be more likely to \u201cundermatch\u201d to their first job. Using administrative data from a large, urban, public college system, we document large gaps in earnings five years after graduation by SES (proxied by financial aid receipt) that remain unexplained even after controlling for GPA, college, field of study, and other pre-graduation characteristics. We then examine how features of the initial job transition relate to longer-term earnings, and to what extent differences in the first job transition can explain later SES earnings gaps. Our results show that first job transitions are rocky for many graduates, strongly predict earnings at Year 5, and are a substantial mediator of socioeconomic gaps in earnings five years after college graduation\u2014reducing the unexplained gap by almost two-thirds."

This implies that export elasticities with respect to the exchange rate are small, rendering even large depreciations ineffectual in the short term. We incorporate two innovations versus existing work. First, we allow for nonlinearities, permitting large depreciations to disproportionately lift exports. Second, we control for banking crises, which accompany many depreciations. Our baseline export elasticity\u2014without nonlinearities or banking crisis controls\u2014is -0.3, consistent with prevailing \u201celasticity pessimism.\u201d This elasticity rises to between -0.5 and -0.8 within two years for depreciations above 20 percent without banking crises."

The problem is, you can\u2019t use them all at once. If you did, you would create hot spots\u2014high temperatures concentrated in tiny areas\u2014with power densities nearing those found at the surface of the sun. This has led to a frustrating paradox known as dark silicon, a term coined by computer architects to describe the growing portion of a chip that must be kept powered down. Up to 80 percent of the transistors on a modern chip must remain \u201cdark\u201d at any given moment to keep the chip from sizzling. We are building supercomputers on a sliver of silicon but only using a fraction of their potential. It\u2019s like building a skyscraper and being able to use only the first 10 floors.</p><p>For years, the industry has battled this thermal limit with bigger fans and more complex liquid cooling systems. But these are fundamentally Band-Aid solutions. Whether using air or liquid, they rely on pulling heat away from the chip\u2019s surface. The heat must first conduct through the silicon to the cooling plate, creating a thermal bottleneck that simply cannot be overcome at the power densities of future chips. Hot spots on today\u2019s chips produce tens of watts per square millimeter, and they pop up in various places on the chip at different times during computations. Air and liquid cooling struggle to focus their efforts at just the hot spots, when and where they appear\u2014they can only try to cool the whole thing en masse.</p><p>We at St. Paul, Minn.\u2013based startup Maxwell Labs are proposing a radical new approach: What if, instead of just moving heat, you could make it disappear? The technology, which we call photonic cooling, is capable of converting heat directly into light\u2014cooling the chip from the inside out. The energy can then be recovered and recycled back into useful electric power. With this approach, instead of cooling the whole chip uniformly, we can target hot spots as they form, with laser precision. Fundamentally, this technique could cool hot spots of thousands of watts per square millimeter, orders of magnitude better than today\u2019s chips are cooled.</p><h2>The Physics of Cooling With Light</h2><p>Lasers are usually thought of as sources of heat, and for good reason\u2014they are most commonly used for cutting materials or transferring data. But under the right circumstances, laser light can induce cooling. The secret lies in a luminescent process known as fluorescence.</p><p>Fluorescence is the phenomenon behind the familiar glow of highlighter markers, coral reefs, and white clothes under black-light illumination. These materials absorb high-energy light\u2014usually in the ultraviolet\u2014and reemit lower energy light, often in the visible spectrum. Because they absorb higher energy than they emit, the difference often results in heating up the material. However, under certain, very niche conditions, the opposite can happen: A material can absorb low-energy photons and emit higher-energy light, cooling down in the process.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A stack of squares on top of a layered cube with arrows pointing at the squares from the top. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0e294\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-stack-of-squares-on-top-of-a-layered-cube-with-arrows-pointing-at-the-squares-from-the-top.png?id=61755825&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">To cool computer chips with lasers, the team at Maxwell Labs plans to place a grid of photonic cold plates on top of the chip substrate. In their demo setup, a thermal camera detects hot spots coming from the chip. A laser then shines onto the photonic cold plate next to the hot spot, stimulating the photonic process that results in cooling. The photonic cold plate [inset] consists of a coupler that guides light in and out of the plate, the extractor where anti-Stokes fluorescence occurs, the back reflector that prevents light from entering the computer chip, and a sensor that is designed to detect hot spots.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">GygInfographics.com</small></p><p>The reemission is higher energy because it combines the energy from the incoming photons with phonons, vibrations in the crystal lattice of a material. This phenomenon is called anti-Stokes cooling, and it was first <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/377500a0\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated</a> in a solid back in 1995 when a team of scientists cooled an ytterbium-doped fluoride glass sample with laser light.</p><p>The choice of ytterbium as a dopant was not random: Anti-Stokes cooling works only under carefully engineered conditions. The absorbing material must be structured so that for nearly every absorbed photon a higher-energy photon will be emitted. Otherwise, other mechanisms will kick in, heating rather than cooling the sample. Ions of ytterbium and other such lanthanides have the right structure of electron orbitals to facilitate this process. For a narrow range of laser wavelengths shining on the material, the ions can effectively absorb the incident light and use phonons to trigger emission of higher-energy light. This reemitted, extracted thermal light needs to escape the material quickly enough to not be absorbed again, which would otherwise cause heating.</p><p>To date, lab-based approaches have <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c00116\" target=\"_blank\">achieved</a> up to 90 watts of cooling power in ytterbium-doped silica glass. As impressive as that is, to achieve the transformative effects on high-performance chips that we anticipate, we need to boost the cooling capacity by many orders of magnitude. Achieving this requires integration of the photonic cooling mechanism onto a thin-film, chip-scale photonic cold plate. Miniaturization not only enables more precise spatial targeting of hot spots due to the tightly focused beam, but is a crucial element for pushing the physics of laser cooling toward high-power and high-efficiency regimes. The thinner layer also makes it less likely that the light will get reabsorbed before escaping the film, avoiding heating. And, by engineering the materials at the scale of the wavelength of light, it allows for increased absorption of the incoming laser beam.</p><h2>Photonic Cold-Plate Technology</h2><p>In our lab, we are developing a way to harness photonic cooling to tackle the heat from today\u2019s and future CPUs and GPUs. Our photonic cold plate is designed to sense areas of increasing power density (emerging hot spots) and then couple light efficiently into a nearby region that cools the hot spots down to a target temperature.</p><p>The photonic cold plate has several components: first the coupler, which couples the incoming laser light into the other components; then, the microrefrigeration region, where the cooling actually happens; next, the back reflector, which prevents light from hitting the CPU or GPU directly; and last a sensor, which detects the hot spots as they form.</p><p>The laser shines onto the targeted area from above through the coupler: a kind of lens that focuses the incoming laser light onto a microrefrigeration region. The coupler simultaneously channels the inbound heat-carrying fluorescent light out of the chip. The microrefrigeration region, which we call the extractor, is where the real magic happens: The specially doped thin film undergoes anti-Stokes fluorescence.</p><p>To prevent the incoming laser light and fluorescent light from entering the actual chip and heating the electronics, the photonic cold plate incorporates a back reflector.</p><p>Crucially, cooling occurs only when, and where, the laser is shining onto the cold plate. By choosing where to shine the laser, we can target hot spots as they appear on the chip. The cold plate includes a thermal sensor that detects hot spots, allowing us to steer the laser toward them.</p><p>Designing this whole stack is a complex, interconnected problem with many adjustable parameters, including the exact shape of the coupler, the material and doping level of the extraction region, and the thickness and number of layers in the back reflector. To optimize the cold plate, we are deploying a multiphysics simulation model combined with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-018-0246-9\" target=\"_blank\">inverse design tools</a> that let us search the vast set of possible parameters. We are leveraging these tools in the hope of improving cooling power densities by two orders of magnitude, and we are planning larger simulations to achieve bigger improvements still.</p><p>Collaborating with our partners at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, we are building a demonstration version of photonic cooling at our lab in St. Paul. We are assembling an array of small photonic cold plates, each a square millimeter in size, tiled atop various CPUs. For demonstration purposes, we use an external thermal camera to sense the hot spots coming from the chips. When a hot spot begins to appear, a laser is directed onto the photonic cold plate tile directly atop it, extracting its heat. Our first iteration of the cold plate used ytterbium ion doping, but we are now experimenting with a variety of other dopants that we believe will achieve much higher performance.</p><p>In an upcoming integrated implementation of this demo, the photonic cold plates will consist of finer tiles\u2014about 100 by 100 micrometers. Instead of a free-space laser, light from a fiber will be routed to these tiles by an on-chip photonic network. Which tiles are activated by the laser light will depend on where and when hot spots form, as measured by the sensor.</p><p>Eventually, we hope to collaborate with CPU and GPU manufacturers to integrate the photonic cold plates within the same package as the chip itself, allowing us to get the crucial extractor layer closer to the hot spots and increase the cooling capacity of the device.</p><h2>The Laser-Cooled Chip and the Data Center </h2><p><span>To understand the impact of our photonic cooling technology on current and future data centers, we have performed an analysis of the thermodynamics of laser cooling combined with and compared to air and liquid cooling approaches. Preliminary results show that even a first-generation laser-cooling setup can dissipate twice the power of purely air and liquid cooling systems. This drastic improvement in cooling capability would allow for several key changes to chip and data-center architectures of the future.</span></p><p>First, laser cooling could eliminate the dark-silicon problem. By sufficiently removing heat from hot spots as they are forming, photonic cooling would permit simultaneous operation of more of the transistors on a chip. That would mean all the functional units on a chip could function in parallel, bringing the full force of modern transistor densities to bear.</p><p>Second, laser cooling can allow for much higher clocking frequencies than is currently possible. This cooling technique can maintain the chip\u2019s temperature below 50 \u00b0C <em><em>everywhere, </em></em>because it targets hot spots. Current-generation chips typically experience hot spots in the 90-to-120 \u00b0C range, and this is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_self\">expected only to get worse</a>. The ability to overcome this bottleneck would allow for higher clocking frequencies on the same chips. This opens up the possibility of improving chip performance without directly increasing transistor densities, giving much needed headroom for Moore\u2019s Law to continue to progress.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A black box with optics and a chip on top, and a camera showing a colorful blob above it. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"82d47\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-box-with-optics-and-a-chip-on-top-and-a-camera-showing-a-colorful-blob-above-it.png?id=61756057&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The demo setup at Maxwell Labs demonstrates how current computer chips can be cooled with lasers. A photonic cold plate is placed on top of the chip. A thermal camera images the hot spots coming from the chip, and a laser is directed at the photonic cold plate directly above the hot spot.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Maxwell Labs</small></p><p>Third, this technology makes 3D integration thermally manageable. Because laser-assisted cooling pinpoints the hot spots, it can more readily remove heat from a 3D stack in a way that today\u2019s cooling tech can\u2019t. Adding a photonic cold plate to each layer in a 3D integrated stack would take care of cooling the whole stack, making 3D chip design much more straightforward.</p><p> Fourth, laser cooling is more efficient than air cooling systems. An even more tantalizing result of the removal of heat from hot spots is the ability to keep the chip at a uniform temperature and greatly reduce the overall power consumption of convective cooling systems. Our calculations show that, when combined with air cooling, reductions in overall energy consumption of more than 50 percent for current generation chips are possible, and significantly larger savings would be achieved for future chips.</p><p>What\u2019s more, laser cooling allows for recovering a much higher fraction of waste energy than is possible with air or liquid cooling. Recirculating hot liquid or air to heat nearby houses or other facilities is possible in certain locations and climates, but the recycling efficiency of these approaches is limited. With photonic cooling, the light emitted via anti-Stokes fluorescence can be recovered by re-collecting the light into fiber-optic cables and then converting it to electricity through thermophotovoltaics, leading to upwards of 60 percent energy recovery.</p><p>With this fundamentally new approach to cooling, we can rewrite the rules by which chips and data centers are designed. We believe this could be what enables the continuation of Moore\u2019s Law, as well as the power savings at the data-center level that could greenlight the intelligence explosion we\u2019re starting to see today.</p><h2>The Path to Photonic Cooling</h2><p>While our results are highly promising, several challenges remain before this technology can become a commercial reality. The materials we are currently using for our photonic cold plates meet basic requirements, but continued development of higher efficiency laser-cooling materials will improve system performance and make this an increasingly economically attractive proposition. To date, only a handful of materials have been studied and made pure enough to allow laser cooling. We believe that miniaturization of the photonic cold plate, aided by progress in optical engineering and thin-film materials processing, will have similarly transformative effects on this technology as it has for the transistor, solar cells, and lasers.</p><p> We\u2019re going to need to codesign the processors, packages, and cooling systems to maximize benefits. This will require close collaboration across the traditionally siloed semiconductor ecosystem. We are working with industry partners to try to facilitate this codesign process.</p><p>Transitioning from a lab-based setup to high-volume commercial manufacturing will require us to develop efficient processes and specialized equipment. Industry-wide adoption necessitates new standards for optical interfaces, safety protocols, and performance metrics.</p><p>Although there is much to be done, we do not see any fundamental obstacles now to the large-scale adoption of photonic cooling technology. In our current vision, we anticipate the early adoption of the technology in high-performance computing and AI training clusters before 2027, showing an order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt of cooling. Then, between 2028 and 2030, we hope to see mainstream data-center deployment, with an accompanied reduction in IT energy consumption of 40 percent while doubling compute capacity. Finally, after 2030 we foresee that ubiquitous deployment, from hyperscale to edge, will enable new computing paradigms limited only by algorithmic efficiency rather than thermal constraints.</p><p>For over two decades, the semiconductor industry has grappled with the looming threat of dark silicon. Photonic cooling offers not merely a solution to that challenge but a fundamental reimagining of the relationship between performance, computation, and energy. By converting waste heat directly into useful photons and ultimately back into electricity, this technology transforms thermal management from a necessary evil into a valuable resource.</p><p>The future of computing is photonic, efficient, and brilliantly cool. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Today she is a professor of electrical engineering at <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamia Millia Islamia University</a> in New Delhi, where she formerly was a dean.</p><h3>Mini Thomas</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Jamia Millia Islamia, in New Delhi</p><p><strong>Title: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Professor of electrical engineering</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong></p><p>Senior member</p><p><strong>Alma maters: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>University of Kerala; the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras; the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.</p><p>Thomas, an expert in power systems and smart grids, is working to get more women into the power and energy industry.</p><p>She is an active IEEE volunteer, having worked with student branches and membership recruitment. As a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/technology-sustainable-climate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization</a>, she shares her knowledge about energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and ozone-layer recovery.</p><p>\u201cFor a woman to succeed, she needs a lot of family support,\u201d Thomas says, because many women\u2019s careers are interrupted by caretaking and child-rearing responsibilities. She acknowledges that not all women have the same support system she has\u2014which is part of the reason why she is dedicated to helping others succeed.</p><h2>A passion for teaching</h2><p>Thomas was born and raised in Kerala, India. Kerala students who excelled at school were expected to choose a career in either medicine or engineering, she says. Medicine wasn\u2019t an option for her, she says, because she faints at the sight of blood. She was good at mathematics, though, so she chose to pursue engineering.</p><p>Although both her parents were teachers (her father taught chemistry; her mother was a language instructor), she wasn\u2019t inspired to pursue a similar path until she was an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://keralauniversity.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Kerala</a>. Her extensive note-taking during class made her popular among her classmates, she says, and some would ask her to tutor them during exam season.</p><p>\u201cMy friends would come over to my home so I could explain the material to them using my notes,\u201d she says. \u201cAfterward, they would tell me that they were able to understand the subject much better than how the professor had explained it. That\u2019s what inspired me to become a teacher.\u201d</p><p>After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1984, Thomas continued her education at the <a href=\"https://www.iitm.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>. Shortly after earning her master\u2019s of technology in electrical engineering in 1986, she began her first teaching job at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, also in Kerala.</p><p>The year was a whirlwind for Thomas, who got married, left her job, and moved to New Delhi, where her husband lived. Instead of searching for another teaching job, she decided to pursue a doctoral degree in the electrical engineering program at the <a href=\"https://www.iitd.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi</a>.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I was 28, I had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which I earned in 1990,\u201d she says. \u201cI soon got a job at Delhi Technological University, the only other college in New Delhi that had an engineering school at that time, other than IIT. From there, I never looked back.\u201d</p><p>She taught at the university for five years, then left in 1995 to join Jamia Millia Islamia. She eventually was promoted to lead the electrical engineering department.</p><p>During her 11 years there, she established labs to conduct research in supervisory control and data acquisition (<a href=\"https://inductiveautomation.com/resources/article/what-is-scada\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SCADA</a>) and substation automation, collaborating with industry on projects. In 2003 she created a curriculum for\u2014and led the launch of\u2014a master\u2019s of technology program in electrical power system management as well as a training program for industry professionals. For her work, she received a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/awards/meritorious-award\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities Board Meritorious Achievement Award</a>.</p><p>In 2014 she founded the school\u2019s <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/cie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a> to help startups turn their ideas into prototypes and launch businesses.</p><p>She received an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse in 2016: become president of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli.</p><p>\u201cThis was a great honor to become the first woman president of that institute,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the only woman among 90 presidents of all the institutions of national importance at that time.\u201d</p><p>But, she says, as president, she didn\u2019t have much time to teach, and after five years, she began to miss her time in the classroom. After her five-year term was completed, she returned to Jamia Millia Islamia in 2021 as engineering dean. Since then, she has led the launch of five programs: three undergraduate programs (in data science, electrical and computer engineering, and VLSI) and graduate programs in data science and environmental sciences.</p><p>This year she stepped down after completing her three-year term as dean and is focusing more on teaching.</p><p>She teaches at least one class each semester because, she says, she finds joy in \u201cimparting and giving knowledge to young minds.\u201d</p><h2>Mentoring women in the power industry</h2><p>Thomas mentors doctoral students as well as professors who aspire to serve as deans or other high-level positions.</p><p>In addition, she trains mid-career women in the power industry on the skills they need to get promoted\u2014to technical and senior management roles\u2014through the <a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/the-wepowernetwork.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">South Asia WePOWER network</a>\u2019s South Asia Region (SAR) 100 professional development program. WePOWER is a coalition of nonprofit and government organizations that aim to increase the number of women working in the power and energy sectors through education. A<a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/weesa-innovate-to-empower/documents.entry.html/2024/05/31/pathways_to_powersouthasiabaselineassessment-ILv3.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 2020 World Bank study</a> found that the percentage of women in technical roles in the industry in South Asia ranges from 0.1 to 21.</p><p>The six-month-long program provides technical training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to 100 women from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Thomas is one of 40 experts who remotely teach topics such as transmission details, distribution, renewable energy, and the importance of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-updates-2025\" target=\"_self\">women in leadership</a>.</p><p>She also mentors women to give them confidence and tools to reach leadership positions because \u201cmentorship is what changed my career trajectory,\u201d she says. When she first began teaching, she says she was reluctant to take high-level positions. But after participating in a six-day leadership training at the <a href=\"https://www.jnu.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a>, which was hosted by the Government of India\u2019s <a href=\"https://ugc.gov.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University Grants Commission</a>, she felt confident in her ability to move up the career ladder.</p><p>\u201cMany women take a break from their careers to raise their children, struggle to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/work-life-balance\" target=\"_self\">balance their personal and professional lives</a>, or don\u2019t have a support system,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to impart the lessons I learned from my experiences and the training I received. Whenever I get a chance, I get involved.\u201d</p><h2>Creating lifelong friendships and mentoring students</h2><p>Thomas joined IEEE in 1990 as a graduate student member and says she continues renewing her membership to stay up to date on emerging technologies, specifically SCADA systems.</p><p>\u201cI learned everything about SCADA from a tutorial developed by the <a href=\"https://ieee-pes.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Power & Energy Society</a>. There was no such material available at that time,\u201d she says.</p><p>Years later, in 2015, Thomas cowrote <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/power-system-scada-and-smart-grids-mini-s-thomas/1133718207\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Power System SCADA and Smart Grids</em></em></a> with her friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndougmcdonald\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John McDonald</a>, whom she met through the organization. McDonald is an IEEE Life Fellow and the founder and CEO of JDM Associates in Duluth, Ga.</p><p>Thomas became an active volunteer for the <a href=\"https://www.ieeedtu.in/IEEEDTU/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delhi Technological University\u2019s student branch</a>, where she helped organize technical talks and other events. When Thomas joined Jamia Millia Islamia, she revived the inactive <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/company/ieeejmi-sb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">student branch</a> there and served as its counselor for 14 years.</p><p>During her 35 years with IEEE, she has served as chair of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities/regional-list-region-10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Region 10</a> student activities committee and vice chair of membership development for <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities</a>. She was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/eab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities</a> and the <a href=\"https://pspb.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Publication Services and Products</a> boards.</p><p>\u201cCreating programs that benefit members makes me feel satisfied,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cVolunteering has also boosted my confidence.\u201d</p><p>She is also a member of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a>\u2019s editorial advisory board.</p><p>Not only does she attribute much of her professional growth to the organization, she also has created lifelong friendships through IEEE, she says. One friend is 2023 IEEE President <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/saifur-rahman-a\" target=\"_self\">Saifur Rahman</a>, whom she met in 2000 when he spoke to the Jamia Millia Islamia student branch.</p><p>\u201cOur friendship has grown so much that Saifur is like family,\u201d she says.</p><p>When Rahman launched the IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization in 2022, he asked Thomas to become a member. She helped create the <a href=\"https://innovate.ieee.org/the-ieee-climate-change-collection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Climate Change Collection</a> on the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Xplore</a> Digital Library. The following year, she led the development of a climate change taxonomy. The 620 words are included in the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Thesaurus</a>, which defines almost 12,500 engineering, technical, and scientific terms. Now she is working with a team to expand the taxonomy by defining hundreds more climate-change terms.</p><p>\u201cYou should always do what you enjoy. For me, that\u2019s teaching and volunteering with IEEE,\u201d she says. \u201cI could just be a member, access the technical content, and be happy with just that, but I volunteer because I can do things that help others.\u201d</p>"

This compact, open-source model can handle massive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-context-window\" target=\"_blank\">context windows</a> of 250,000 tokens (meaning that it can \u201cremember\u201d and reason over much more text than typical language models) and can run at high speed, even on consumer devices. The launch highlights a growing shift: smaller, more efficient models could shape the future of AI just as much as raw scale. </p><p>\u201cWe believe in a more decentralized future for AI\u2014one where not everything runs in massive data centers,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ori-goshen/\" target=\"_blank\">Ori Goshen</a>, Co-CEO of AI21, in an interview with <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>. \u201cLarge models will still play a role, but small, powerful models running on devices will have a significant impact\u201d on both the future and the economics of AI, he says. Jamba is built for developers who want to create edge-AI applications and specialized systems that run efficiently on-device.</p><p>AI21\u2019s Jamba Reasoning 3B is designed to handle long sequences of text and challenging tasks like math, coding, and logical reasoning\u2014all while running with impressive speed on everyday devices like laptops and mobile phones. Jamba Reasoning 3B can also work in a hybrid setup: Simple jobs are handled locally by the device, while heavier problems get sent to powerful cloud servers. According to AI21, this smarter routing could dramatically cut AI infrastructure costs for certain workloads\u2014potentially by an order of magnitude.</p><h2>A Small but Mighty LLM</h2><p>With 3 billion parameters, Jamba Reasoning 3B is tiny by today\u2019s AI standards. Models like GPT-5 or Claude run well past 100 billion parameters, and even smaller models, such as Llama 3 (8B) or Mistral (7B), are more than twice the size of AI21\u2019s model, Goshen notes.</p><p>That compact size makes it more remarkable that AI21\u2019s model can handle a context window of 250,000 tokens on consumer devices. <span>Some proprietary models, like GPT-5, offer even longer context windows, but Jamba sets a new high-water mark among open-source models. The previous open-model</span><span> record of 128,000 tokens </span><span>was held by </span><span>Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2 (3B), Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 Mini, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepseek\" target=\"_blank\">DeepSeek R1</a>, which are all much larger models. </span><span>Jamba Reasoning 3B can process more than 17 tokens per second even when working at full capacity</span><span>\u2014that is, with</span><span> extremely long inputs that use its full 250,000-token context window. Many other models slow down or struggle once their input length exceeds 100,000 tokens.</span></p><p>Goshen explains that the model is built on an architecture called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19887\" target=\"_blank\">Jamba</a>, which combines two types of neural network designs: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model\" target=\"_blank\">transformer</a> layers, familiar from other large language models, and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mamba-model\" target=\"_blank\">Mamba</a> layers, which are designed to be more memory-efficient. This hybrid design enables the model to handle long documents, large codebases, and other extensive inputs directly on a laptop or phone\u2014using about one-tenth the memory of traditional transformers. Goshen says the model runs much faster than traditional transformers because it relies less on a memory component called the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joaolages/kv-caching-explained-276520203249\" target=\"_blank\">KV cache</a>, which can slow down processing as inputs get longer. </p><h2>Why Small LLMs Are Needed</h2><p>The model\u2019s hybrid architecture gives it an advantage in both speed and memory efficiency, even with very long inputs, confirms a software engineer who works in the LLM industry. The engineer requested anonymity because they\u2019re not authorized to comment on other companies\u2019 models. <span>As more users run generative AI locally on laptops, models need to handle long context lengths quickly without consuming too much memory. At 3 billion parameters, Jamba meets these requirements, says the engineer, making it a model that\u2019s optimized for on-device use.</span></p><p>Jamba Reasoning 3B is open source under the permissive <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 license</a> and available on popular platforms such as <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugging Face</a> and <a href=\"https://lmstudio.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">LM Studio</a>. The release also comes with instructions for fine-tuning the model through an open-source reinforcement-learning platform (called <a href=\"https://github.com/volcengine/verl\" target=\"_blank\">VERL</a>), making it easier and more affordable for developers to adapt the model for their own tasks.</p><p>\u201cJamba Reasoning 3B marks the beginning of a family of small, efficient reasoning models,\u201d Goshen said. \u201cScaling down enables decentralization, personalization, and cost efficiency. Instead of relying on expensive GPUs in data centers, individuals and enterprises can run their own models on devices. That unlocks new economics and broader accessibility.\u201d</p>"

Then a pattern is made, the fabric is chosen and cut, and the garment is sewed. Finally the clothing is packaged and shipped.</p><p>To expedite the process, some apparel companies now use 3D technologies including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/augmented-reality-consumers-customize-products\" target=\"_self\">design software</a>, <a href=\"https://sagroups.ieee.org/ic15-004/home/ic-groups/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">body scans</a>, visualization, and 3D <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printing-smart-objects\" target=\"_self\">printers</a>. The tools allow designers to envision their creations in a variety of colors, fabrics, and motifs.

Based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, the consultancy assists fashion and consumer goods companies with automating content, managing 3D digital assets, and improving workflows.</p><h2>Custom-made clothing by 3D and AI</h2><p>Ill-fitting garments, shoes, and accessories are problems for clothing companies. The average <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/media/clothing-return-rates-by-category-and-country-csf-a/#:~:text=Global%20Overview,in%20the%20region%20at%2022%2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">return rate worldwide for clothing ordered online is more than 25 percent</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.prime-ai.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PrimeAI</a>.</p><p>To make ready-to-wear clothing, designers use grading, a process that takes an initial sample pattern of a base size using established standards and 3D body scans, then makes smaller and larger versions to be mass-produced. But the resulting clothes do not fit everyone.</p><p>Returns, which can be frustrating for shoppers, are costly for clothing companies due to reshipping and restocking expenses.</p><p>Some customers can\u2019t be bothered to send back unwanted items, and they throw them in the garbage, where they end up in landfills.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we could go back to the days when you would go to a shop, get measured, and someone would custom-make your garment?\u201d posits <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-lavange-b0358a15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh LaVange</a>, an assistant professor of technical design and patternmaking at FIT.</p><p>That was the idea behind LaVange\u2019s winning project, Automated Custom Sizing. Her proposal uses 3D technology and AI to produce custom-tailored clothing on demand for all body types. She outlined short- and long-term scalable solutions in her submission.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to fix our fit problem, but I also realize we can\u2019t do that as an industry without changing the manufacturing process.\u201d <strong>\u2014Leigh LaVange</strong></p><p>\u201cI see it [custom sizing] as a solution that can be automated and eventually rolled out across all different types of brands,\u201d she says.</p><p>The short-term proposal involves measuring a person\u2019s base body specifications, such as bust, waist, thighs, biceps, and hips\u2014either manually or from a 3D body scan. An avatar of the customer is then created and entered into a database preloaded with 3D representations of various sizes of the sample garment. The AI program notes the customer\u2019s specs and the existing sizes to determine the best fit. If, for example, the person\u2019s chest matches the medium-size dimensions but the hips are a few millimeters larger, the program still might recommend medium because it determined the material around the hips had enough excess fabric. A rendering of an avatar wearing an item is shown to customers to help them decide whether to make the purchase.</p><p>LaVange says her solution will help improve customer satisfaction and minimize returns.</p><p>Her long-term plan is a truly customized fit. Using 3D body scans, an AI program would determine the necessary adjustments to the pattern based on the customer\u2019s specifications and critical fit points, like the waist, while preserving the original design. The 3D system then would make alterations, which would be rendered on the customer\u2019s avatar for approval. The solution would eliminate excess inventory, LaVange says, because the clothing would be custom-made.</p><p>Because her proposals rely on technologies not currently used by the industry and a different way of interacting with customers, a shift in production would be required, she says.</p><p>\u201cMost manufacturing systems today are set up to produce as many units as possible in a single day,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a way to produce garments efficiently if you set up your manufacturing facility correctly.

Instead, they tend to rely on medical professionals to save the day after they\u2019ve gotten sick.</p><p><a href=\"https://mx.linkedin.com/in/ximena-montserrat-ramirez-aguilar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ximena Montserrat Ramirez Aguilar</a> is working to change that by educating her fellow Mexicans about how to manage their health so they can avoid undergoing treatment for preventable conditions such as Type 2 diabetes and its associated conditions affecting the eyes, cardiovascular system, brain, heart, kidneys, and other organs.</p><h3>Ximena Montserrat Ramirez Aguilar</h3><br /><p><strong>MEMBER GRADE:</strong></p><p>Student member</p><p><strong>UNIVERSITY: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n, in Monterrey, Mexico</p><p><strong>MAJOR: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Biomedical<strong> </strong>engineering</p><p>Ramirez envisions her career as advancing health through disease prevention, but she acknowledges that, as an undergraduate, she is still discovering how to turn her vision into reality. A senior studying biomedical engineering at the<a href=\"https://www.uanl.mx/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n</a> (UANL), in Monterrey, Mexico, she is the founding chair of her school\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.embs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</a> (EMBS) student branch. The student member\u2019s research interests in<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neuroscience\" target=\"_self\"> neuroengineering</a> and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> artificial intelligence</a> are shaping her vision for the future of health care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about technology and health,\u201d she says. \u201cBiomedical engineering is giving me a way to combine these two worlds and work on solutions that make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>Her growing influence in<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE</a> coupled with her academic achievements signal a promising, influential career.</p><h2>From chemistry to caring </h2><p>Ramirez was born in<a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/676/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Zacatecas, Mexico</a>, known for its silver mines, agriculture, and strong cultural pride. From a young age, she loved science\u2014particularly chemistry\u2014and thrived in schools designated for advanced learners.</p><p>Her first exposure to the health care field came during high school, when she trained as a nursing technician. Her high school curriculum was organized as a co-op program, which included traditional classes alternating with internships in nursing. Ramirez interned at the <a href=\"https://www.medicina.uanl.mx/hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez</a> in Monterrey, Mexico.</p><p>Alternating between the academic and vocational tracks allowed her to graduate with a diploma and a technical degree at the same time. Speaking of her early experiences, she says, \u201cI saw how many patients struggled, not just with their conditions but also with the logistics of seeking and coordinating treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat made me want to work at the intersection of medicine and innovation.\u201d</p><p>With her father working as a materials engineer and her mother as an accountant, she grew up in a household where technical problem-solving and analytical thinking were part of daily life.</p><p>That blend of influences reinforced her decision to pursue engineering as a career rather than the medical field, she says.</p><h2>Exploring neuroengineering and AI</h2><p>Since beginning her studies at UANL in 2021, Ramirez has focused on neuroengineering, one of three specializations the school offers. She has explored the role artificial intelligence plays in diagnosing and treating conditions including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alzheimers-disease\" target=\"_self\"> Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\"> </a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression\" target=\"_self\">depression</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\">, epilepsy</a>, and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/schizophrenia\" target=\"_self\"> schizophrenia</a>.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_self\">IEEE mentoring program</a>, she received guidance from global experts including a doctor from India who helped refine her early AI projects.</p><p>Her work quickly evolved from class assignments to projects with real-world potential.</p><p>\u201cThe project I\u2019m most excited about has not been published, but it mainly consisted of using convolutional neural networks in medical image processing (MRI) and machine learning in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases,\u201d she says.</p><p>This year she broadened her scope by attending the IEEE<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Conference on Robotics and Automation</a> in Atlanta, where she gained exposure to both industrial and academic applications of robotics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick. I want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Currently she is an intern at <a href=\"https://www.aunainvestors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Auna</a>, a health care network in Latin America. She contributes to improving the patient experience in hospitals across Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.</p><p>\u201cI design projects aimed at improving the quality of care and making the hospital intervention more effective for patients across different stages: prevention/wellness, diagnosis, hospitalization, rehabilitation, and post-discharge follow-up,\u201d She declined to provide specific examples, citing medical confidentiality agreements.</p><p>\u201cMy internship is about finding ways to make health care not just effective but also more humane,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about improving processes so patients feel cared for\u2014from the moment they enter the hospital until they leave.\u201d</p><h2>Finding leadership and purpose in IEEE</h2><p>Ramirez founded the IEEE EMBS student branch in 2023. As chair, she represents the branch at <a href=\"https://r9.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Region 9</a> meetings, where she advocates for mentorship opportunities and collaboration with other IEEE groups.</p><p>Through her involvement, she says, she has gained not only technical knowledge but also critical soft skills in leadership, time management, and teamwork.</p><p>\u201cIEEE taught me how to lead with empathy and how to work with people from different backgrounds,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has expanded my vision beyond Mexico, showing me challenges and innovations happening all over the world.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree abroad\u2014potentially in public health or AI for medical devices\u2014and ultimately a Ph.D. Her long-term goal is to launch a business focused on developing health care innovations, specifically in disease prevention.</p><h2>A future built on innovation</h2><p>For Ramirez, improving health care means more than developing cutting-edge technology. It also involves rethinking how people understand and manage their own health.</p><p>\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Her vision is as ambitious as it is personal, rooted in her own journey from Zacatecas to Monterrey and beyond.</p><p>As her career advances, she says, she intends to keep IEEE at the center of her professional life.</p><p>\u201cIn IEEE I\u2019ve found a community that challenges me to grow, supports me when I fail, and celebrates when I succeed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about engineering; it\u2019s about building a better future, together.\u201d</p>"

What works as a lab-bench mockup breaks in reality. Harnessing and safely storing energy at grid scale and in cars, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-trucks'\" target=\"_self\">trucks</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-air-taxi-industry\" target=\"_self\">planes</a> is a very hard problem that simplified models sometimes can\u2019t touch. <strong></strong></p><p><span>\u201cIn electrification, at its core, you have this combination of electromagnetic effects, heat transfer, and structural mechanics in a complicated interplay,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/blogs/author/bjorn-sjodin/\" target=\"_blank\">Bjorn Sjodin</a><span>, senior vice president of product management at the Stockholm-based software company </span><a href=\"https://comsol.com/\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL</a><span>. </span></p><p>COMSOL is an engineering R&amp;D software company that seeks to simulate not just a single phenomenon\u2014for instance, the electromagnetic behavior of a circuit\u2014but rather <em>all</em> the pertinent physics that needs to be simulated for developing new technologies in real-world operating conditions. </p><p><span>Engineers and developers gathered in Burlington, Mass. on 8 to 10 October for COMSOL\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/conference/boston\" target=\"_blank\">annual Boston conference</a><span>, where they discussed engineering simulations via multiple simultaneous physics packages. And </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/comsol\" target=\"_self\">multiphysics modeling</a><span>, as the emerging field is called, has emerged as a component of electrification R&amp;D that is becoming more than just nice to have.</span></p><p>\u201cSometimes, I think some people still see simulation as a fancy R&amp;D thing,\u201d says <span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/niloofar-kamyab-ph-d-0a200b10a/\" target=\"_blank\">Niloofar Kamyab</a></span>, a chemical engineer and applications manager at COMSOL. \u201cBecause they see it as a replacement for experiments. But no, experiments still need to be done, though experiments can be done in a more optimized and effective way.\u201d</p><h3>Can Multiphysics Scale Electrification?</h3><p>Multiphysics, Kamyab says, can sometimes be only half the game.</p><p>\u201cI think when it comes to batteries, there is another attraction when it comes to simulation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s multi<em>scale</em>\u2014how batteries can be studied across different <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_self\">scales</a>. You can get in-depth analysis that, if not very hard, I would say is impossible to do experimentally.\u201d</p><p>In part, this is because batteries reveal complicated behaviors (and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-ion-battery-fires\" target=\"_blank\">runaway reactions</a>) at the cell level but also in unpredictable new ways at the battery-pack level as well. <strong></strong></p><p>\u201cMost of the people who do simulations of battery packs\u2014thermal management is one of their primary concerns,\u201d Kamyab says. \u201cYou do this simulation so you know how to avoid it. You recreate a cell that is malfunctioning.\u201d She adds that multiphysics simulation of thermal runaway enables battery engineers to safely test how each design behaves in even the most extreme conditions\u2014in order to stop any battery problems or fires before they could happen. </p><p>Wireless charging systems are another area of electrification, with their own thermal challenges<span>.</span><span> \u201cAt higher power levels, localized heating of the coil changes its conductivity,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://www.veryst.com/about/our-team/nirmal-paudel\" target=\"_blank\">Nirmal Paudel</a><span>, a lead engineer at </span><a href=\"https://www.veryst.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Veryst Engineering</a><span>, a consulting firm based in Needham, Mass. And that, he notes, in turn can change the entire circuit as well as the design and performance of all the elements that surround it.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-motor\" target=\"_self\">Electric motors</a> and power converters require similar simulation savvy. <span>According to electrical engineer and COMSOL senior application engineer </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vigneshwaran-gurusamy/\" target=\"_blank\">Vignesh Gurusamy</a><span>, older ways of developing these age-old electrical workhorse technologies are proving less useful today. </span><span>\u201cThe recent surge in electrification across diverse applications demands a more holistic approach as it enables the development of new optimal designs,\u201d Gurusamy says.</span><span></span></p><p>And freight transportation: <span>\u201cFor trucks, people are investigating, </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mobile-bess\" target=\"_self\">Should we use batteries</a><span>? </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hydrogen-truck\" target=\"_self\">Should we use fuel cells</a><span>?\u201d Sjodin says. \u201cFuel cells are very multiphysics friendly\u2014fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reactions, and electrochemical reactions.\u201d</span></p><p><span>Lastly, there\u2019s the electric grid itself. </span><span>\u201cThe grid is designed for a continuous supply of power,\u201d Sjodin says. \u201cSo when you have power sources [like wind and solar] shutting off and on all the time, you have completely new problems.\u201d <strong></strong></span></p><h3>Multiphysics in Battery and Electric-Motor Design</h3><p>Taking such an all-in approach to engineering simulations can yield unanticipated upsides as well, says Kamyab. <span>Berlin-based automotive engineering company </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAV_GmbH\" target=\"_blank\">IAV</a>, for example,<span> is developing power-train systems that integrate multiple battery formats and chemistries in a single pack. </span><span>\u201c</span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/natron-sodium-ion-battery-failure\" target=\"_blank\">Sodium ion</a><span> cannot give you the energy that </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-battery\" target=\"_blank\">lithium ion</a><span> can give,\u201d Kamyab says. \u201cSo they came up with a blend of chemistries, to get the benefits of each, and then designed a thermal management that matches all the chemistries.\u201d</span></p><p>Jakob Hilgert, who works as a technical consultant at IAV, recently contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/story/driving-ev-development-with-a-twin-battery-approach-140391\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL industry case study</a>. In it, Hilgert described the design of a dual-chemistry battery pack that combines sodium-ion cells with a more costly lithium solid-state battery.</p><p>Hilgert says that using multiphysics simulation enabled the IAV team to play the two chemistries\u2019 different properties off of each other. \u201cIf we have some cells that can operate at high temperatures and some cells that can operate at low temperatures, it is beneficial to take the exhaust heat of the higher-running cells to heat up the lower-running cells, and vice versa,\u201d Hilgert said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we came up with a cooling system that shifts the energy from cells that want to be in a cooler state to cells that want to be in a hotter state.\u201d</p><p>According to Sjodin, IAV is part of a larger trend in a range of industries that are impacted by the electrification of everything. <span>\u201cAlgorithmic improvements and hardware improvements multiply together,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the future of multiphysics simulation. It will allow you to simulate larger and larger, more realistic systems.\u201d</span></p><p>According to COMSOL\u2019s Gurusamy, GPU accelerators and surrogate models allow for bigger jumps in electric-motor capabilities and efficiencies. Even seemingly simple components like the windings of copper wire in a motor core (called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/axial-flux\" target=\"_self\">stators</a>) provide parameters that multiphysics can optimize.</p><p>\u201cA primary frontier in electric-motor development is pushing power density and efficiency to new heights, with thermal management emerging as a key challenge,\u201d Gurusamy says. \u201cMultiphysics models that couple electromagnetic and thermal simulations\u2026incorporate temperature-dependent behavior in stator windings and magnetic materials.\u201d</p><p>Simulation is also changing the wireless charging world, Paudel says. \u201cTraditional design cycles tweak coil geometry,\u201d he says. \u201cToday, integrated multiphysics platforms enable exploration of new charging architectures,\u201d including flexible charging textiles and smart surfaces that adapt in real time.</p><p>And batteries, according to Kamyab, are continuing a push toward higher power densities and lower prices. Which is changing not just the industries where batteries are already used, like consumer electronics and EVs. Higher-capacity batteries are also driving new industries like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pivotal-helix\" target=\"_self\">electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft</a> (eVTOLs).</p><p>\u201cThe reason that many ideas that we had 30 years ago are becoming a reality is now we have the batteries to power them,\u201d Kamyab says. \u201cThat was the bottleneck for many years.... And as we continue to push battery technology forward, who knows what new technologies and applications we\u2019re making possible next.\u201d</p>"

You\u2019re faced with a photo of an average U.S. house, maybe two floors with a front lawn in a cul-de-sac and an American flag flying proudly out front. But there\u2019s nothing particularly distinctive about this home, nothing to tell you the state it\u2019s in or where the owners are from.</span></p><p>You have two tools at your disposal: your brain and 44,416 low-resolution, bird\u2019s-eye-view photos of random places across the United States and their associated location data. Could you match the house to an aerial image and locate it correctly? </p><p>I definitely couldn\u2019t, but a new machine learning model likely could. The software, created by researchers at <a href=\"https://upc.cucas.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">China University of Petroleum (East China)</a>, searches a database of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/radar-imaging-monitoring-climate-change\" target=\"_self\">remote-sensing</a> photos with associated location information to match the street-side image\u2014of a home or a commercial building or anything else that can be photographed from a road\u2014to an aerial image in the database. While other systems can do the same, this one is pocket size compared with others and superaccurate. </p><p>At its best (when faced with a picture that has a 180-degree field of view), it succeeds up to 97 percent of the time in the first stage of narrowing down the location. That\u2019s better than or within two percentage points of all the other models available for comparison. Even under less-than-ideal conditions, it performs better than many competitors. When pinpointing an exact location, it\u2019s correct 82 percent of the time, which is within three points of the other models.</p><p>But this model is novel for its speed and memory savings. It is at least twice as fast as similar ones and uses less than a third of the memory they require, according to the researchers. The combination makes it valuable for applications in navigation systems and the defense industry.</p><p>\u201cWe train the AI to ignore the superficial differences in perspective and focus on extracting the same \u2018key landmarks\u2019 from both views, converting them into a simple, shared language,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://renpenghit.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Peng Ren</a>, who develops machine learning and signal-processing algorithms at China University of Petroleum.</p><p>The software relies on a method called deep cross-view hashing. Rather than try to compare each pixel of a street-view picture to every single image in the giant bird\u2019s-eye-view database, this method relies on hashing, which means transforming a collection of data\u2014in this case, street-level and aerial photos\u2014into a string of numbers unique to the data.</p><p>To do that, the university\u2018s research group employs a type of deep-learning model called a vision transformer that splits images into small units and finds patterns among the pieces. The model may find in a photo what it\u2019s been trained to identify as a tall building, circular fountain, or roundabout, and then encodes its findings into number strings. ChatGPT is based on similar architecture, but it finds patterns in text instead of images. (The \u201cT\u201d in \u201cGPT\u201d stands for \u201ctransformer.\u201d)</p><p>The number that represents each picture is like a fingerprint, says <a href=\"https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/\" target=\"_blank\">Hongdong Li</a>, who studies computer vision at Australian National University, in Canberra. The number code captures unique features from each image that allow the geolocation process to quickly narrow down possible matches. </p><p>In the new system, the code associated with a given ground-level photo gets compared with those of all of the aerial images in the database (for testing, the team used satellite images of the United States and Australia), yielding the five closest candidates for aerial matches. Data representing the geography of the closest matches is averaged using a technique that weighs locations closer to each other more heavily to reduce the impact of outliers, and out pops an estimated location of the street-view image.</p><p>The new mechanism for geolocation was published last month in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153558\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</em></em></a>.</p><h2>Fast and memory efficient </h2><p>\u201cThough not a completely new paradigm,\u201d this paper \u201crepresents a clear advance within the field,\u201d Li says. Because this problem has been solved before, some experts, like  computer scientist <a href=\"https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Nathan-Jacobs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Jacobs</a>, of Washington University in St. Louis, are not as excited. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is a particularly groundbreaking paper,\u201d he says. </p><p>But Li disagrees with Jacobs\u2014he thinks this approach is innovative in its use of hashing to make finding images matches faster and more memory efficient than conventional techniques.<span> It uses just 35 megabytes, while the next smallest model Ren\u2019s team examined requires 104 MB, about three times as much space.</span></p><p>The method is more than twice as fast as the next fastest one, the researchers claim. When matching street-level images to a dataset of aerial photography of the United States, the time it took the runner-up to match was around 0.005 seconds. The Petroleum group was able to find a location in around 0.0013 seconds, almost four times as fast.</p><p>\u201cAs a result, our method is more efficient than conventional image geolocalization techniques,\u201d says Ren, and Li confirms that these claims are credible. Hashing \u201cis a well-established route to speed and compactness, and the reported results align with theoretical expectations,\u201d Li says.</p><p>Though these efficiencies seem promising, more work is required to ensure this method will work at scale, Li says. The group did not fully study realistic challenges like seasonal variation or clouds blocking the image, which could impact the robustness of the geolocation matching. Down the line, this limitation can be overcome by introducing images from more distributed locations, Ren says.</p><p>Still, long-term applications (beyond a superadvanced GeoGuessr) are worth considering now, experts say. </p><p>There are some trivial uses for an efficient image geolocation, such as automatically geotagging old family photos, says Jacobs. But on the more serious side, navigation systems could also exploit a geolocation method like this one. If <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/gladys-west-hidden-figure-gps\" target=\"_self\">GPS</a> fails in a self-driving car, another way to quickly and precisely find locations could be useful, Jacobs says. Li also suggests it could play a role in emergency response within the next five years. </p><p>There may also be applications in defense systems. <a href=\"https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/finder\" target=\"_blank\">Finder</a>, a 2011 project from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, aimed to help intelligence analysts learn as much as they could about photos without metadata using reference data from sources including overhead images, a goal that could be accomplished with models similar to this new geolocation method. </p><p><span>Jacobs puts the defense application into context: If a government agency sent a photo of a terrorist training camp without metadata, how can the site be geolocated quickly and efficiently? Deep cross-view hashing might be of some help.</span> </p>"

We assembled in a narrow room. A long table occupied the room\u2019s center. Snacks and sodas were set out along the back wall; the lighting was subdued. The dominant feature of this cramped chamber was a big one-way mirror occupying almost the entire front wall. Sitting at the table, one could see through the looking glass into a wonderland of market research on the other side. In that much larger, brightly lit room were comfortable chairs, an easel with a large pad of paper, and our hired facilitator. Although this was a familiar trope I\u2019d seen a hundred times on TV, actually lurking in an observation room like this felt a touch surreal.</p><h2>iRobot vs Focus Group</h2><p>We\u2019d paid maybe US $10,000 for the privilege of setting up some focus groups\u2014probably the most the company had ever spent on a market research event. But we needed to know how potential customers would react to our Roomba prototype when they saw one in the (plastic) flesh cleaning the floor at their feet. At the appointed hour, our facilitator welcomed eight to 10 bona fide ordinary people as they filed into the large room and sat in the chairs. Our mind-child was about to receive its first critical judgment from strangers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Dancing-with-Roomba-Cracking-the-Robot-Riddle-and-Building-an-Icon/Jones/p/book/9781032890616\"></a><a class=\"shortcode-media-lightbox__toggle shortcode-media-controls__button material-icons\" style=\"background: gray;\" title=\"Select for lightbox\">aspect_ratio</a><img alt=\"Book cover: Roomba with signatures and red dance shoes on wooden floor.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"aa4ad\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/book-cover-roomba-with-signatures-and-red-dance-shoes-on-wooden-floor.jpg?id=61715094&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This article was adapted from the author\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Dancing-with-Roomba-Cracking-the-Robot-Riddle-and-Building-an-Icon/Jones/p/book/9781032890616\" target=\"_blank\">Dancing with Roomba: Cracking the Robot Riddle and Building an Icon</a>  (Routledge 2025).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>The facilitator prepared participants by encouraging them to state their honest views and not to be swayed by the comments of others. \u201cYou are the world\u2019s expert in your own opinion,\u201d she told them.</span></p><p>At first the facilitator described Roomba without showing the group any photos or the device itself. She was met with skepticism that such a thing would actually work. Then she demonstrated one of the prototypes we had prepared for the event. As participants watched Roomba go about its business on both carpets and hard floors, their doubts ebbed. Even those who stated that they would never purchase such a device couldn\u2019t help being intrigued. As the group discussion proceeded, soccer moms (representing \u201cearly mass-market adopters\u201d) emerged as the most interested. They saw Roomba as a time-saver. This surprised and pleased us, as we\u2019d expected the much smaller market of gadget geeks would be the first to fall in love.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Transparent blue Roomba vacuum on wooden floor near a doorway.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2503f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/transparent-blue-roomba-vacuum-on-wooden-floor-near-a-doorway.jpg?id=61715051&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">iRobot built about 20 of its third major Roomba prototype, the T100, all with 3D-printed shells.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p>But we could take neither interest nor love to the bank. We needed to know how much customers would pay. Our facilitator eased into that part of the gathering\u2019s proceedings. She did not inquire directly but rather asked, \u201cIf you saw this product in a store, what would you expect the price to be?\u201d</p><p><span>The focus group\u2019s responses were all over the map. Some people mentioned a price close to the $200 we intended to charge. A few folks we regarded as saints-in-training expected an even higher number. But most were lower. One woman said she\u2019d expect Roomba to be priced at $25. Later when asked what she thought a replacement battery might cost, she said, \u201c$50.\u201d That hurt. For this lady, attaching our robot to a battery devalued the battery.</span></p><h2>Floor Cleaner or Robot?</h2><p>Throughout the proceedings our facilitator had been careful to leave a couple of things unmentioned. First, she never referred to Roomba as a robot, calling it instead an \u201cautomatic floor cleaner.\u201d Three separate groups, comprising an aggregate of around two dozen people, gave their opinions that day. Of these, only two individuals spontaneously applied the term \u201crobot\u201d to Roomba.</p><p>The second unmentioned characteristic was the nature of Roomba\u2019s cleaning mechanism. That is, the facilitator had revealed no details about how it worked. Participants had seen the demo, they observed Roomba cleaning effectively, they had given their opinion about the price. They\u2019d all assumed that a vacuum was at work, several used that term to refer to the robot. But now the facilitator told them, \u201cRoomba is a carpet sweeper, not a vacuum.\u201d Then she asked again what they would expect to pay. On average, focus-group members from all three groups cut their estimates in half. Participants who had previously said $200 now said $100.</p><p>The focus group\u2019s brutal revaluation exploded our world. The enabling innovation that made the energy budget work, that made Roomba technically and economically feasible, was cleaning with a carpet sweeper rather than a vacuum. People had seen that the carpet-sweeper-Roomba really did work. Yet they chose to trust conventional wisdom about vacuums versus carpet sweepers rather than their own apparently lying eyes. If we were forced to cut the robot\u2019s price in half, we would lose money on every unit sold, and there would be no Roomba.</p><p>At the end of the evening, before any member of our stunned team could stagger out the door, Winston said simply, \u201cRoomba has to have a vacuum.\u201d A shotgun wedding was in the offing for bot and vac.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Round white robot with cartoon puppy sticker, named &quot;Scamp,&quot; on a desk.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4d0a6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/round-white-robot-with-cartoon-puppy-sticker-named-scamp-on-a-desk.jpg?id=61715054&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Scamp, the earliest Roomba prototype, was built in 1999.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>The next day at work we gathered to discuss the focus group\u2019s revelation. A half-hearted attempt or two to deny reality quickly faded\u2014electrical engineer Chris Casey saw to that\u2014and we accepted what we needed to do. But changing things now would be a huge challenge in multiple ways. We were deep into development, closer to launch than kickoff. All the electrical power our battery could supply was already spoken for. None was available for a new system that would likely be more power hungry than all the robot\u2019s other systems combined. And where could we put a vacuum? All the space in the robot was also fully assigned. Our mandate to clean under furniture and between chair legs wouldn\u2019t let us make the robot any bigger.</span></p><h2>Making Roomba a Vacuum</h2><p>One escape hatch beckoned, but no one was eager to leap through it. Chris articulated what we were all thinking. \u201cWe could build a vestigial vacuum,\u201d he said. That is, we could design a tiny, pico-power vacuum\u2014one that consumes almost no power and does almost nothing\u2014strap it on the robot, and call it done. Perversely, that seemed reasonable. The robot already cleaned the floor well; our cleaning tests proved it. Customers, however, didn\u2019t know that. They were all steeped in the dogma of vacuum supremacy. Reeducating the masses wasn\u2019t possible\u2014we didn\u2019t have the funds. But if we could assert on the box that Roomba had a vacuum, then everyone would be satisfied. We could charge the price that makes our economics work. Customers would deem that cost reasonable and wouldn\u2019t have to unlearn their vacuum bias.</p><p>But it felt wrong. If we must add a new system to the robot, we wanted it\u2014like all the other systems\u2014to earn its keep honestly, to do something useful. Through further discussion and calculation, we concluded that we could afford to devote about 10 percent of the robot\u2019s 30-watt power budget to a vacuum. Conventional manual vacuums typically gorged themselves on 1,200 watts of power, but if we could develop a system that provided useful cleaning while consuming only 3 W (0.25 percent of 1,200) then we would feel good about adding it to the robot. It just didn\u2019t seem very likely.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and red Roomba vacuum on a gray carpet next to a plaid multicolored blanket.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"35719\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-red-roomba-vacuum-on-a-gray-carpet-next-to-a-plaid-multicolored-blanket.jpg?id=61715075&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">iRobot built two identical second-generation Roomba prototypes, named Kipper and Tipper, one of which is shown here.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>I sometimes find that solving a problem is largely a matter of staring at the problem\u2019s source. Gaze long and intently enough at something and, Waldo-like, the solution may reveal itself. So I took one of the team\u2019s manual vacuums and stared at it. What exactly made it use as much power as it did? I knew the answer was partly marketing rather than reality. There was no simple, objective way to compare cleaning efficacy between vacuums. Lacking a results-based method, shoppers looked at inputs. For example, a vacuum with a 10-ampere motor sounds as though it should clean better than a vacuum with a 6-amp motor. But the bigger number might only mean that the manufacturer with the 10-amp claim was using a less-efficient motor\u2014the 6-amp (720-W) motor might clean just as well.</span></p><p>But even when you corrected for the amperage arms race, a vacuum was still a power glutton. Staring at the vacuum cleaner, I began to see why. The vacuum fixed in my gaze that day used the standard configuration: a cylindrical beater brush occupied the center of a wide air inlet. A motor, attached by a belt, spun the brush. Another motor, deeper in the machine, drove a centrifugal blower that drew air in through the inlet. To keep dirt particles kicked up by the beater brush entrained in the airstream, the air needed to move fast. The combination of a wide inlet and high velocity meant that every second the vacuum motor had to gulp a huge volume of air.</p><p>Accelerating all that air took considerable power\u2014the physics was inescapable. If we wanted a vacuum that sipped power rather than guzzled it, we had to move a much smaller volume of air per second. We could accomplish that\u2014without reducing air velocity\u2014if, instead of a wide inlet, we used a narrow one. To match the manual vacuum\u2019s air velocity using only a 3-W motor, I computed that we would need a narrow opening indeed: only a millimeter or two.</p><p>That instantly disqualified Roomba from using the standard vacuum configuration\u2014we could not put our bristle brush in the middle of the air inlet. That would require an inlet maybe 20 times too wide. We\u2019d have to find another arrangement.</p><h2>A Micro Vacuum that Doesn\u2019t Suck</h2><p>To test the narrow-inlet idea I turned to my favorite prototyping materials: cardboard and packing tape. Using these, I mocked up my idea. The inlet for my test vacuum was as long as Roomba\u2019s brush but only about 2 millimeters wide. To provide suction I repurposed the blower from a defunct heat gun. Then I applied my jury-rigged contraption to crushed Cheerios and a variety of other dirt stand-ins. My novel vacuum was surprisingly effective at picking up small debris from a hard surface. Using an anemometer to measure the speed of the air rushing through my narrow inlet showed that it was, as desired, as fast as the airstream in a standard vacuum cleaner.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/south-pole-roombas\" target=\"_self\">Roombas at the End of the World</a></p><p>The next step was to somehow shoehorn our microvacuum into Roomba. To form the narrow inlet we used two parallel vanes of rubber. Small rubber bumps protruding from one vane spanned the inlet, preventing the vanes from collapsing together when vacuum was applied. We placed the air inlet parallel to and just behind the brush. The only plausible space for the vacuum <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeller\" target=\"_blank\">impeller</a>, motor, and filter (needed to separate the dirt from the flowing air) was to take over a corner of the dust cup. Drawing on his now well-honed skills of packing big things into tiny spaces where they had no business fitting, mechanical engineer Eliot Mack managed somehow to accomplish this. But we did get help from an outside consultant to design the intricate shape the impeller needed to move air efficiently.</p><p>In general, regular vacuums perform better on carpet than on hard floors. But Roomba inverted that relationship. Our vacuum operated like a squeegee, pulling dirt from tile, linoleum, and wooden floors. But it was less effective on other surfaces. The sweeper mechanism did the heavy lifting when cleaning carpet.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Silver and gray Roomba robotic vacuum on a hardwood floor.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9e12a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/silver-and-gray-roomba-robotic-vacuum-on-a-hardwood-floor.jpg?id=61715088&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">iRobot released its first production version of the Roomba in September 2002.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>Despite the team\u2019s reluctance to add a vacuum and despite the unit\u2019s low power, the vacuum genuinely improved Roomba\u2019s cleaning ability. We could demonstrate this convincingly. First, we disabled Roomba\u2019s new vacuum by disconnecting the power and then cleaned a hard floor relying only on the carpet-sweeper mechanism. If we then walked across the floor barefoot, we would feel a certain amount of grit underfoot. If we repeated the exercise with vacuum power on, the floor was pristine. Bare feet would detect no grit whatsoever.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Seven people pose in front of shelves displaying awards and a gold iRobot Roomba; casual attire.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a8f77\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/seven-people-pose-in-front-of-shelves-displaying-awards-and-a-gold-irobot-roomba-casual-attire.jpg?id=61715091&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Roomba contributors present on the occasion of the 500,000th Roomba include Steve Hickey, Eliot Mack [front row], Paul Sandin, Chris Casey, Phil Mass, Joe Jones, and Jeff Ostaszewski [back row].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joe Jones</small></p><p><span>Years later I learned that the focus group had a back story no one mentioned at the time. While the Roomba team had swallowed the carpet-sweeper concept hook, line, and sinker, Winston had not. He was uneasy with the notion that customers would be cleaning-mechanism agnostic\u2014thinking instead that they simply wouldn\u2019t believe our robot would clean their floors if it didn\u2019t have a vacuum. He found at least indirect support for that position when he scoured marketing data from our earlier collaboration with SC Johnson.</span></p><p>But Winston, well-attuned to the engineering psyche, knew he couldn\u2019t just declare, \u201cRoomba has to have a vacuum.\u201d We\u2019d have pushed back, probably saying something like, \u201cWhat your business-school-addled brain doesn\u2019t appreciate is that it\u2019s the carpet sweeper that makes the whole concept work!\u201d Winston had to show us.

The team calls their model MorphDiff, and it\u2019s a diffusion model guided by the transcriptome, the pattern of genes turned up or down after a perturbation.</p><p>At a high level, the idea flips a familiar workflow. High-throughput imaging is a proven way to discover a compound\u2019s mechanism or spot bioactivity but profiling every candidate drug or CRISPR target isn\u2019t feasible. MorphDiff learns from cases where both gene expression and cell morphology are known, then uses only the L1000 gene expression profile as a <em>condition</em> to generate realistic post-perturbation images, either from scratch or by transforming a control image into its perturbed counterpart. The claim is that competitive fidelity on held-out (unseen) perturbations across large drug and genetic datasets plus gains on mechanism-of-action (MOA) retrieval can rival real images.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"><a href=\"https://mbzuai.ac.ae/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"shortcode-media-lightbox__toggle shortcode-media-controls__button material-icons\" style=\"background: gray;\" title=\"Select for lightbox\">aspect_ratio</a><img alt=\"Logo with connected black dots next to the words Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1e76f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/logo-with-connected-black-dots-next-to-the-words-mohamed-bin-zayed-university-of-artificial-intelligence.png?id=61715906&amp;width=980\" /></p><p>This research led by <a href=\"https://mbzuai.ac.ae/\" target=\"_blank\">MBZUAI</a> researchers starts from a biological observation: gene expression ultimately drives proteins and pathways that shape what a cell looks like under the microscope. The mapping isn\u2019t one-to-one, but there\u2019s enough shared signal for learning. Conditioning on the transcriptome offers a practical bonus too: there\u2019s simply far more publicly accessible L1000 data than paired morphology, making it easier to cover a wide swath of perturbation space. In other words, when a new compound arrives, you\u2019re likely to find its gene signature which MorphDiff can then leverage.</p><p>Under the hood, MorphDiff blends two pieces. First, a Morphology Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) compresses five-channel microscope images into a compact latent space and learns to reconstruct them with high perceptual fidelity. Second, a Latent Diffusion Model learns to denoise samples in that latent space, steering each denoising step with the L1000 vector via attention.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Diagram depicting cell painting analysis pipeline, including dataset curation and perturbation modeling.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f692c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-depicting-cell-painting-analysis-pipeline-including-dataset-curation-and-perturbation-modeling.webp?id=61715913&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Wang et al., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63478-z\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Communications</a> (2025), <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 4.0</a></small></p><p>Diffusion is a good fit here: it\u2019s intrinsically robust to noise, and the latent space variant is efficient enough to train while preserving image detail. The team implements both gene-to-image (G2I) generation (start from noise, condition on the transcriptome) and image-to-image (I2I) transformation (push a control image toward its perturbed state using the same transcriptomic condition). The latter requires no retraining thanks to an SDEdit-style procedure, which is handy when you want to explain changes relative to a control.</p><p><span>It\u2019s one thing to generate photogenic pictures; it\u2019s another to generate </span><em>biologically faithful</em><span> ones. The paper leans into both: on the generative side, MorphDiff is benchmarked against GAN and diffusion baselines using standard metrics like FID, Inception Score, coverage, density, and a CLIP-based CMMD. Across JUMP (genetic) and CDRP/LINCS (drug) test splits, MorphDiff\u2019s two modes typically land first and second, with significance tests run across multiple random seeds or independent control plates. The result is consistent: better fidelity and diversity, especially on OOD perturbations where practical value lives.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\">The bigger picture is that generative AI has finally reached a fidelity level where in-silico microscopy can stand in for first-pass experiments.</p><p><span></span><span>More interesting for biologists, the authors step beyond image aesthetics to morphology features. They extract hundreds of CellProfiler features (textures, intensities, granularity, cross-channel correlations) and ask whether the generated distributions match the ground truth.</span></p><p>In side-by-side comparisons, MorphDiff\u2019s feature clouds line up with real data more closely than baselines like IMPA. Statistical tests show that over 70 percent of generated feature distributions are indistinguishable from real ones, and feature-wise scatter plots show the model correctly captures <em>differences</em> from control on the most perturbed features. Crucially, the model also preserves correlation structure between gene expression and morphology features, with higher agreement to ground truth than prior methods, evidence that it\u2019s modeling more than surface style.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graphs and images comparing different computational methods in biological data analysis.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"44b8e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/graphs-and-images-comparing-different-computational-methods-in-biological-data-analysis.webp?id=61715915&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Wang et al., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63478-z\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Communications</a> (2025), <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 4.0</a></small></p><p>The drug results scale up that story to thousands of treatments.

Given a query profile, can you find reference drugs with the same mechanism? MorphDiff\u2019s generated morphologies not only beat prior image-generation baselines but also outperform retrieval using gene expression alone, and they approach the accuracy you get using </span><em>real</em><span> images. In top-k retrieval experiments, the average improvement over the strongest baseline is 16.9 percent and 8.0 percent over transcriptome-only, with robustness shown across several k values and metrics like mean average precision and folds-of-enrichment. That\u2019s a strong signal that simulated morphology contains complementary information to chemical structure and transcriptomics which is enough to help find look-alike mechanisms even when the molecules themselves look nothing alike.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\">MorphDiff\u2019s generated morphologies not only beat prior image-generation baselines but also outperform retrieval using gene expression alone, and they approach the accuracy you get using real images.</p><p>The paper also lists some current limitations that hint at potential future improvements. Inference with diffusion remains relatively slow; the authors suggest plugging in newer samplers to speed generation. Time and concentration (two factors that biologists care about) aren\u2019t explicitly encoded due to data constraints; the architecture could take them as additional conditions when matched datasets become available. And because MorphDiff depends on perturbed gene expression as input, it can\u2019t conjure morphology for perturbations that lack transcriptome measurements; a natural extension is to chain with models that predict gene expression for unseen drugs (the paper cites GEARS as an example). Finally, generalization inevitably weakens as you stray far from the training distribution; larger, better-matched multimodal datasets will help, as will conditioning on more modalities such as structures, text descriptions, or chromatin accessibility.</p><p>What does this mean in practice? Imagine a screening team with a large L1000 library but a smaller imaging budget. MorphDiff becomes a phenotypic copilot: generate predicted morphologies for new compounds, cluster them by similarity to known mechanisms, and prioritize which to image for confirmation. Because the model also surfaces interpretable feature shifts, researchers can peek under the hood. Did ER texture and mitochondrial intensity move the way we\u2019d expect for an EGFR inhibitor? Did two structurally unrelated molecules land in the same phenotypic neighborhood? Those are the kinds of hypotheses that accelerate mechanism hunting and repurposing.</p><p>The bigger picture is that generative AI has finally reached a fidelity level where in-silico microscopy can stand in for first-pass experiments. We\u2019ve already seen text-to-image models explode in consumer domains; here, a transcriptome-to-morphology model shows that the same diffusion machinery can do scientifically useful work such as capturing subtle, multi-channel phenotypes and preserving the relationships that make those images more than eye candy. It won\u2019t replace the microscope. But if it reduces the number of plates you have to run to find what matters, that\u2019s time and money you can spend validating the hits that count.</p>"

This is literally an iconic and globally unique institution. We break ground and start to establish a new foundation for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-quantum-computing-hausi-muller\" target=\"_self\">quantum physics</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\">generative artificial intelligence</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/telecommunications/\" target=\"_self\">optical communications</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Johnson & Johnson</a> pharmaceutical company is headquartered in the city and got its start in a local wallpaper factory. The Johnson brothers and <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Thomas_Alva_Edison\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Edison</a> often ate at a nearby drugstore lunch counter, where they discussed advancements in manufacturing, the mayor said. <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Thomas_Edison_at_Menlo_Park\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edison\u2019s laboratory was in Menlo Park</a>. Cahill also said that <a href=\"https://princetonhistory.org/research/historic-princeton/albert-einstein/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Albert Einstein</a>, who worked at Princeton University and lived in the town, was often spotted strolling the streets of New Brunswick, about 30 km away.</p><h2>State-of-the-art research facilities</h2><p>The new Nokia Bell Lab offices will cater to the needs of research scientists and specialists in focused areas, Klein said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an efficient, modern, and low-carbon facility providing sustainable power, heating, and cooling capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cOur researchers will have access to the best facility possible. That is our dream.\u201d</p><p>This is not the first time Bell Labs has moved its headquarters, Vetter noted. The primary R&amp;D activities were set up in New York City in 1925. They moved to Murray Hill in 1941. Some of the biggest innovations were developed there during the following decade, including the transistor and the cellular network.</p><p>\u201cI want to think that our move will again be a catalyst for breakthrough innovations to happen in the decade after we move in and will be in a variety of areas such as 7G, AI, quantum computing, and quantum network security,\u201d Vetter said.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cAs we build and move into the HELIX, this continues our legacy of excellence, pioneering spirit, and commitment to breakthrough research on the East Coast.\u201d <strong>\u2014Thierry Klein</strong></p><p>\u201cWe also need to make sure the research goes into the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like to say that if somebody has a problem in the real world and you solve it in the lab but you don\u2019t make that leap of technology into the real world, the problem still exists.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just research or breakthrough technologies,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s also creating the companies that will commercialize these technologies and lead the next century of innovation.\u201d</p><h2>IEEE Milestones recognize Bell Labs innovations</h2><p>Another celebratory event is scheduled for 21 October in Murray Hill.

All of those fans are pushing hot air away from the temperature-sensitive computer chips and toward air-conditioning units.</p><p>But those fans, whirr as they might, are no longer cutting it. Over the past decade, the power density of the most advanced computer chips has exploded. In 2017, Nvidia came out with the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/data-center/v100/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">V100</a> GPU, which draws 300 watts of power. Most of that power dissipates back out as heat. Three years later, in 2020, Nvidia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A100</a> came out, drawing up to 400 W. The now-popular <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">H100</a> arrived in 2022 and consumes up to 700 W. The newest <a href=\"https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-blackwell-architecture?ncid=no-ncid\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blackwell</a> GPUs, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-blackwell\" target=\"_self\">revealed</a> in 2024, consume up to 1,200 W.</p><p>\u201cRoad maps are looking at over 2,000 watts [per chip] over the next year or two,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewmatter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drew Matter</a>, president and CEO of the liquid-cooling company <a href=\"https://www.mikrostechnologies.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mikros Technologies</a>. \u201cIn fact, the industry is preparing for 5-kilowatt chips and above in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p><p>This power explosion is driven by the obvious culprit\u2014AI. And all the extra computations consuming all that added power from advanced chips are generating unmanageable amounts of heat.</p><p>\u201cThe average power density in a rack was around 8 kW,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-claman-3438731/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Claman</a>, CEO of the startup <a href=\"https://accelsius.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accelsius</a>. \u201cFor AI, that\u2019s growing to 100 kW per rack. That\u2019s an order of magnitude. It\u2019s really AI adoption that\u2019s creating this real urgency\u201d to figure out a better way to cool data centers.</p><p>Specifically, the urgency is to move away from fans and toward some sort of liquid cooling. For example, water has roughly four times the specific heat of air and is about 800 times as dense, meaning it can absorb around 3,200 times as much heat as a comparable volume of air can. What\u2019s more, the thermal conductivity of water is 23.5 times as high as that of air, meaning that heat transfers to water much more readily.</p><p>\u201cYou can stick your hand into a hot oven and you won\u2019t get burned. You stick your hand into a pot of boiling water and you can instantly get third-degree burns,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eganseamus/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seamus Egan</a>, general manager of immersion cooling at <a href=\"https://www.airedale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Airedale by Modine</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s because the liquid transfers heat much, much, much, much more quickly.\u201d</p><p>The data-center industry by and large agrees that cooling chips with liquid is the future, at least for AI-focused data centers. \u201cAs AI has made racks denser and hotter, liquid cooling has become the de facto solution,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karin-overstreet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Karin Overstreet</a>, president of <a href=\"https://www.nortekdatacenter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nortek Data Center Cooling</a>, said via email.</p><p>But there are a number of ways to do liquid cooling, from the simple and straightforward to the complex and slightly weird.</p><p>At the simple end, there\u2019s circulating chilled water through cold plates attached to the hottest chips. Then there\u2019s circulating not water but a special dielectric fluid that boils inside the cold plate to take away the heat. A third approach is dunking the entire server into a fluid that keeps it cool. And, last and most splashy, is dunking the server into a boiling vat of liquid.</p><p>Which method will end up being the industry standard for the high-end AI factories of the future? At this point, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Here\u2019s how the four methods work, and where they might find the most use.</p><h2>#1: Single-Phase Direct-to-Chip Cooling</h2><p>The most technologically mature approach is to use water. Already, many AI data centers are employing such direct-to-chip liquid cooling for their hottest chips.</p><p>In this scheme, metal blocks, called cold plates, with channels in them for coolant to circulate, are placed directly on top of the chips. The cold plates match the size of the chips and go inside the server. The liquid is usually water, with some glycol added to prevent bacterial growth, stabilize the temperature, protect against freezing and corrosion, and increase the viscosity of the liquid. The glycol-water mixture is forced through the cold plate, whisking away heat right from the source.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two computer servers with wires and water pipes coming out. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7627e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-computer-servers-with-wires-and-water-pipes-coming-out.png?id=61730623&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Companies like Mikros Technologies are pursuing single-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling.

Inside the heat exchanger, a separate loop of \u201cfacility water\u201d is used to cool down the glycol water. The facility water is in turn cooled by either a chiller\u2014an electrically powered refrigeration unit\u2014or a dry cooler, an outdoor unit that uses fans to blow ambient air over the water as it moves through pipes. A dry cooler is much simpler and more energy efficient than a chiller, but it works only in cooler climates\u2014it can\u2019t cool the water below the ambient temperature.<p><span>One difficulty with this approach is that putting a cold plate on every single heat-producing component in a server is unfeasible. It only makes sense to put cold plates on the most energy-dense components\u2014namely GPUs and some CPUs\u2014leaving smaller components, like power supplies and memory units, to be cooled the old-fashioned way, with fans.</span></p><p><strong>\u201c</strong>The trend is moving toward a hybrid-cooling solution,\u201d Overstreet says. \u201cSo liquid cooling does about 80 percent of the cooling for the server room or the data hall, and about 20 percent is the existing air-cooling solution.\u201d</p><h2>#2: Two-Phase Direct-to-Chip Cooling</h2><p>With GPU power densities showing no signs of leveling off, direct-to-chip water cooling is hitting a limit. You can, of course, increase the flow of water, but that will use more energy. Or you can operate the chips at a higher temperature, which will cut into their performance and in the long run degrade the chips. Fortunately, there\u2019s a third option: to squeeze a bit more out of the physics of heat exchange.</p><p>The extra cooling power offered by physics comes from latent heat\u2014that is, the energy it takes to change phase, in this case from liquid to gas. As the liquid boils off the GPU, it absorbs that extra latent heat as it turns into gas, without increasing temperature.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Dark blue server room with five little windows showing liquid inside\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b317d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/dark-blue-server-room-with-five-little-windows-showing-liquid-inside.png?id=61730633&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Companies like Accelsius are proposing two-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling. Here, a cold plate is also placed on top of the hottest chips, and the liquid circulating through the cold plate boils directly atop the chip. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Big Idea Productions</small></p>That\u2019s basically how two-phase direct-to-chip cooling works. In this scheme, a specially formulated dielectric liquid circulates through cold plates sitting atop high-energy chips and boils into vapor. The vapor is then fed back to a heat exchanger, which cools the fluid using facility water.<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really boiling to cool,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mydtruong/\" target=\"_blank\">My Truong</a>, chief technology officer of the startup <a href=\"https://zutacore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ZutaCore</a>, which makes two-phase direct-to-chip cooling systems.</p><p><span>Water boils at 100 \u00b0C (at atmospheric pressure), which is too high for proper chip operation. So you need a specially formulated fluid with a lower boiling point. ZutaCore\u2019s chief evangelist, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahar-belkin-0b01079/?originalSubdomain=il\" target=\"_blank\">Shahar Belkin</a><span>, explains that the fluid they use is sourced from chemical suppliers like Honeywell and Chemours, and boils at a temperature as low as 18 \u00b0C, which can be adjusted up or down by tweaking the pressure in the loop. In addition, the fluid is dielectric\u2014it\u2019s not electrically charged unless polarized by an external electric field. So, unlike water, if some of the fluid spills onto the electronics, it won\u2019t damage the costly equipment.</span></p><p>With water, the temperature increases drastically as it flows over the hot chips. That means the incoming water needs to be kept cold, and so the facility water requires cooling with chillers in most climates.</p><p>With boiling dielectric fluid, however, the fluid remains roughly the same temperature and simply changes phase into a vapor. That means both the liquid and the facility water can be kept at a higher temperature, resulting in significant energy savings.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">When liquid boils on top of a hot chip, the chip is cooled not only through contact with the cooler liquid, but also through the latent heat it takes to induce a phase change. </small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Accelsius</small></p><p><span>\u201cBecause of the really efficient boiling process that happens on the cold plate, we can accept facility water that\u2019s 6 to 8 degrees warmer than [with] single phase,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-beran-60a563101/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucas Beran</a><span>, director of product marketing at </span><a href=\"https://accelsius.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Accelsius</a><span>, another startup working on two-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling.</span></p><p>The two-phase setup also requires lower liquid flow rates than the traditional single-phase water approach, so it uses less energy and runs less risk of damaging the equipment. The flow rate of two-phase cooling is about one-fifth that of single-phase cooling, Belkin says.</p><p>With single-phase water cooling, he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to flow a gallon per minute into the cold plate\u201d for the most advanced chips running at 2,000 W. \u201cThis means very, very high pressure, very, very high flow. It means that pumping will be expensive, and [the cooling system] will actually harm itself with the high flow.\u201d</p><h2>#3: Single-Phase Immersion Cooling</h2><p>Direct-to-chip liquid cooling offers much more cooling capacity than just blowing air, but it still relies on cold plates as intermediaries to do the cooling.</p><p>What if you could bypass the cold plate altogether and just dunk the entire computer server in coolant? Some companies are doing just that.</p><p>In this approach, the data center is arranged around immersion tanks rather than racks, each tank roughly the size of a refrigerator. The immersion tanks are filled with a dielectric fluid, usually an oil, which must be nonconductive and have strong thermal transfer properties, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-bielstein-8a92986b/\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Bielstein</a>, global sales manager of immersion cooling at <a href=\"https://baltimoreaircoil.com/home\" target=\"_blank\">Baltimore Aircoil Co.</a> The fluid also requires long-term stability and low environmental and fire risk.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A server with Nvidia labels submerged in liquid. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e2411\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-server-with-nvidia-labels-submerged-in-liquid.png?id=61730648&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sustainable Metal Cloud is advocating for single-phase immersion cooling, in which an entire server is submerged in a vat of liquid to keep it cool.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"http://firmus.co\" target=\"_blank\">Firmus Technologies</a></small></p><p>With immersion cooling, everything gets cooled by the same fluid. After the oil has whisked away the heat, there are various approaches to cooling the immersion fluid. Baltimore Aircoil, for one, has designed a heat exchanger that circulates facility water through coils and plates inside the tank, Bielstein explains. \u201cThe heated water is then pumped to an outside cooler that releases the heat into the air, cools the water, and sends it back to the heat exchanger to absorb more heat from the tank. This process uses up to 51 percent less energy versus traditional designs.\u201d</p><p>The team at Singapore-based <a href=\"https://smc.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Metal Cloud</a> (SMC), which builds immersion-cooling systems for data centers, has figured out the modifications that need to be made to servers to make them compatible with this cooling method. Beyond removing the built-in fans, the company swaps out the thermal-interface materials that connect chips to their heat sinks, as some of those materials degrade in the oil. Oliver Curtis, co-CEO of SMC and its sister company Firmus, told <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> the modifications they make are small but important to the functioning of SMC\u2019s setup.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve created the perfect operating environment for a computer,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThere\u2019s no dust, no movement, no vibration, because there\u2019s no fans. And it\u2019s a perfect operating temperature.\u201d</p><p>There are some chips whose power density is still too high to be completely cooled by the slow-moving oil. In those cases, it\u2019s necessary to add cold plates to increase the oil flow over them. \u201cSingle-phase immersion has already hit the limits\u201d for cooling these advanced chips, says Egan of Airedale by Modine. Adding cold plates to immersion cooling, he says, \u201cwill definitely provide support for more advanced chip architectures and reduce the heat load on the single-phase dielectric fluid. The new challenge is that I now need two separate cooling-loop systems.\u201d</p><h2>#4: Two-Phase Immersion Cooling</h2><p>If no one cooling method is enough on its own, how about putting all of them together, and dunking your data center into a vat of boiling oil?</p><p>Some companies already are.</p><p>\u201cTwo-phase immersion is probably the most moon-shot technology when it comes to data-center liquid cooling,\u201d says Beran, of Accelsius.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonhvac/\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon Marshall</a>, global marketing manager of data-center liquid cooling at <a href=\"https://www.chemours.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Chemours</a>, says this is where the industry is headed. \u201cWe believe from the research that we\u2019ve done that two-phase immersion is going to come up in a pretty reasonable way.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"[left] Man in labcoat stands next to black box with a window onto a server.

And while two-phase direct-to-chip cooling may work for the chips of today, it still leaves many components, such as memory modules and power supplies, to be air cooled. As CPUs and GPUs grow more powerful, these memory modules and power supplies will also require liquid cooling.</p><p>\u201cThat list of problems is not going anywhere,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cI think the immersion-cooling piece is going to continue to grow in interest as we move forward. People are going to get more comfortable with having a two-phase fluid inside of a rack just like they have [with] putting water in a rack through single-phase direct-to-chip technology.\u201d</p><p>In their lab in Newark, Del., the Chemours team has placed several high-power servers in tanks filled with a proprietary, specially formulated fluid. The fluid is dielectric, so as not to cause shorts, and it\u2019s also noncorrosive and designed to boil at the precise temperature at which the chips are to be held. The fluid boils directly on top of the hot chips.

The temperature required to condense our fluid can eliminate the need for chillers and other complex mechanical infrastructure in most cases.\u201d</p><p>According to a recent <a href=\"https://pages.chemours.com/IC-Case-Study-October-2024.html?utm_medium=landingpage&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=2024-immersion_cooling_casestudycampaign_registered&amp;utm_content=ocp_eventpage&amp;utm_term=eng-international-downloadassets\" target=\"_blank\">case study</a> by Chemours researchers, two-phase immersion cooling is more cost effective than single-phase immersion or single-phase direct-to-chip in most climates. For example, in Ashburn, Va., the 10-year total cost of ownership was estimated at US $436 million for a single-phase direct-to-chip setup, $491 million for a single-phase immersion setup, and $433 million for a two-phase immersion-cooling setup, mostly due to lower power requirements and a simplified mechanical system.</p><p>Critics argue that two-phase immersion makes it hard to maintain the equipment, especially since the oils are so specialized, expensive, and prone to evaporating. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an immersion tank, and there\u2019s dollar signs evaporating from it, that can make it a bit of a challenge to service,\u201d Beran says.</p><p>However, Egan of Airedale by Modine says his company has developed a way to mostly avoid this issue with its immersion tanks, which are intended for edge applications. \u201cOur EdgeBox is specifically designed to maintain the vapor layer lower down in the tank with a layer of air above it and closer to the tank lid. When the tank is opened (for a short maintenance period), the vapor layer does not \u2018flow out\u2019 of the tank,\u201d Egan wrote via email. \u201cThe vapor is much heavier than air and therefore stays lower in the tank. The minimal vapor loss is offset by a buffer tank of fluid within the system.\u201d</p><p>For the foreseeable future, people in the industry agree that the power demands of AI will keep going up, and the need for cooling along with them.</p><p>\u201cUnless the floor falls out from under AI and everybody stops building these AI clusters, and stops building the hardware to perform training for large language models, we\u2019re going to need to keep advancing cooling, and we\u2019re going to need to solve the heat problem,\u201d Marshall says.</p><p>Which cooling technology will dominate in the coming AI factories? It\u2019s too soon to say. But the rapidly changing nature of data centers is opening up the field to a lot of inventiveness and innovation.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not only a great market for liquid cooling,\u201d says Drew Matter, of Mikros Technologies, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a fun engineering problem.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"
