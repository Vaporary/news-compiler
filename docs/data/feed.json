Using Massachusetts marriage registers linked to U.S. censuses (1850\u20131920), we create new father\u2013child links for women to estimate intergenerational mobility and assortative mating, overcoming a key historical linkage barrier. Estimates from a structural marriage market model suggest assortative mating fell 61% from 1850\u20131870 to 1900\u20131920. Counterfactuals imply women\u2019s mobility would have been far lower absent the decline in assortative mating. Had late cohorts faced early cohort sorting, the rank\u2013rank slope between a woman\u2019s father and husband would have been 2.5 times higher."

Acceptance decreased with greater discomfort and increased with both larger charitable donations and personal payments. We show that private monetary incentives and prosocial benefits interact in a less-than-additive way: personal compensation raises participation but attenuates the marginal impact of charitable donations, making the combined impact of private and social rewards smaller than the sum of their separate effects. We also find suggestive evidence that the sequencing of compensated and uncompensated choices may change the responsiveness to charitable benefits. Overall, our results indicate that context, especially the presence (and timing) of private rewards, can affect the relationship between incentives and prosocial behavior."

We show that the peg temporarily boosts China\u2019s export growth by preventing an appreciation of the Chinese currency, thereby amplifying the US labor-market consequences of the China shock. At the same time, the temporary export boom increases China\u2019s savings and leads to a larger US trade deficit. Calibrating the model to match trade and labor-market flow data, we find that China\u2019s currency peg played a quantitatively important role in the US manufacturing decline, the widening US trade deficit, and unemployment dynamics. These results underscore the importance of exchange-rate adjustment (or the lack thereof) for understanding trade shocks. We also find that the overall welfare impact of the China shock remains significant and positive."

We study the effects of expanded full-day programming in Head Start, using the 2016 federal funding initiative that targeted grantees with low full-day enrollment. Linking administrative program data, geo-coded center locations, and household data on employment, we estimate a difference-in-differences design by comparing mothers of young children in treated and untreated areas. The policy increased full-day enrollment by 19 percent and raised single mothers\u2019 employment (1.9%), hours (2.5%), and earnings (6.5%).

This chapter surveys the literature on gender norms and economic development, focusing on the pervasive and traditional \u2018male breadwinner norm\u2019 that assigns men to market work and women to domestic responsibilities. We review empirical approaches to measuring norms, including direct survey questions on attitudes, second-order beliefs about others' views, and behavioral proxies. Establishing causal effects of norms on behavior poses significant challenges, and we review a range of approaches to identify this link. We then present the leading hypotheses about the origins of gender norms in different forms of biological comparative advantage. We discuss societal forces sustaining norms, including self-reinforcing feedback between behavior and beliefs, other institutions, and backlash against norm violations. We highlight the bidirectional relationship between norms and development: economic growth can liberalize norms through structural transformation, legal reforms, and diffusion mechanisms, whereas talent misallocation stemming from gender norms may constrain growth. We conclude by discussing gender norms beyond the breadwinner domain, including norms around kinship, property, leadership, violence, mobility, sexuality, appearance, and behavior, and identify promising directions for future research."

GPT is evaluated on classification and attribute rating performance against 1000+ human annotated tasks across a range of topics and data. We find that GPT as a measurement tool is accurate across domains and generally indistinguishable from human evaluators. Our evidence indicates that labeling results do not depend on the exact prompting strategy used, and that GPT is not relying on training data contamination or inferring attributes from other attributes. We showcase the possibilities of GABRIEL by quantifying novel and granular trends in Congressional remarks, social media toxicity, and county-level school curricula. We then apply GABRIEL to study the history of tech adoption, using it to assemble a novel dataset of 37,000 technologies. Our analysis documents a tenfold decline of time lags from invention to adoption over the industrial age, from ~50 years to ~5 years today. We quantify the increasing dominance of companies and the U.S. in innovation, alongside characteristics that explain whether a technology will be adopted slowly or speedily."

We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation."

R&amp;D investment, by contrast, is only mildly procyclical. We show that this difference could arise because of a positive response of R&amp;D investment to uncertainty - promoting more research, development, and experimentation - a feature of most recessions but most notably during COVID. Both effects are distinct manifestations of real options, one in which costly reversibility delays investment, and the other in which investment enhances resolution of uncertainty."

        "summary": "Entrepreneurial ventures typically require multiple independent conditions to hold simultaneously for success. This paper develops a formal framework for decision-making under such multiplicative uncertainty. When a venture's success depends on several factors\u2014each of which must resolve favourably\u2014even modestly uncertain factors compound to produce low overall success probabilities. I introduce the concept of a miracle budget: the maximum aggregate uncertainty a venture can carry while remaining viable. The miracle budget increases with a venture's payoff-to-cost ratio but only logarithmically, so even transformative opportunities buy only modest additional slack in aggregate uncertainty. The framework characterises optimal experimentation strategies, including the value of information from different experimental designs, conditions for optimal sequencing of experiments, and the allocation of experimental effort across uncertain factors. A hierarchical model distinguishes real miracles\u2014genuinely uncertain factors that can only be resolved by trying\u2014from apparent miracles\u2014factors that seem uncertain but can be resolved through investigation. The framework yields actionable principles for early-stage entrepreneurs: compute your budget, prioritise low-cost tests with high \u201ckill\u201d probability (and, when experiment costs are similar, start with the most uncertain factors), and focus early-stage work on learning how many miracles you actually face."

        "summary": "Does generative artificial intelligence (AI) reinforce or reduce productivity differences across workers? Existing evidence largely studies AI within firms and occupations, where organizational selection compresses educational heterogeneity, leaving unclear whether AI narrows productivity gaps across individuals with substantially different levels of formal education. We address this question using a randomized online experiment conducted outside firms, in which 1,174 adults ages 25\u201345 with heterogeneous educational backgrounds complete an incentivized, workplace-style business problem-solving task. The task is a general (not domain specific) exercise, and participants perform it either with or without access to a generative-AI assistant. Unlike prior work that studies heterogeneity within relatively homogeneous worker samples, our design targets the between\u2013education-group productivity gap as the primary estimand. We find that AI increases productivity for all participants, with substantially larger gains for lower-education individuals. In the absence of AI access, higher-education participants outperform lower-education participants by 0.548 standard deviations; with AI access, this gap falls to 0.139 standard deviations, implying that generative AI closes about three quarters of the initial productivity gap. We interpret this pattern as evidence that generative AI narrows effective productivity differences in task execution by relaxing cognitive constraints that are more binding for lower-education individuals, even though underlying skill differences remain, as reflected in persistent education gaps in task performance and in a follow-up exercise without AI assistance."

On January 6, 2026, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued new guidance documents clarifying how it interprets existing law for the review of wearable and AI-assisted devices. </p><p>The first document, for <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-wellness-policy-low-risk-devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">general wellness</a>, specifies that the FDA will interpret noninvasive sensors such as sleep trackers or heart rate monitors as low-risk wellness devices while treating invasive devices under conventional regulations. The other document defines how the FDA will exempt <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-support-software\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clinical decision support tools</a> from medical device regulations, limiting such software to analyzing existing data rather than extracting data from sensors, and requiring them to enable independent review of their recommendations. The documents do not rewrite any statutes, but they refine interpretation of existing law, compared to the 2019 and 2022 documents they replace. They offer a fresh lens on how regulators see technology that sits at the intersection of consumer electronics, software, and medicine\u2014a category many other countries are choosing to regulate more strictly rather than less.</p><h2>What the 2026 update changed</h2><p>The 2026 FDA update clarifies how it distinguishes between \u201cmedical information\u201d and systems that measure physiological \u201csignals\u201d or \u201cpatterns.\u201d Earlier guidance discussed these concepts more generally, but the new version defines signal-measuring systems as those that collect continuous, near-continuous, or streaming data from the body for medical purposes, such as home devices transmitting blood pressure, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/should-you-trust-apples-new-blood-oxygen-sensor\" target=\"_blank\">oxygen saturation</a>, or <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smartphone-camera-senses-patients-pulse-breathing-rate\" target=\"_blank\">heart rate</a> to clinicians. It gives more concrete examples, like a blood glucose lab result as medical information versus continuous glucose monitor readings as signals or patterns.</p><p>The updated guidance also sharpens examples of what counts as medical information that software may display, analyze, or print. These include radiology reports or summaries from legally marketed software, ECG reports annotated by clinicians, blood pressure results from cleared devices, and lab results stored in electronic health records. </p><p>In addition, the 2026 update softens FDA\u2019s earlier stance on clinical decision tools that offer only one recommendation. While prior guidance suggested tools needed to present multiple options to avoid regulation, FDA now indicates that a single recommendation may be acceptable if only one option is clinically appropriate, though it does not define how that determination will be made. </p><p>Separately, updates to the general wellness guidance clarify that some non-invasive wearables\u2014such as optical sensors estimating blood glucose for wellness or nutrition awareness\u2014may qualify as general wellness products, while more invasive technologies would not.</p><h2>Wellness still requires accuracy</h2><p>For designers of wearable health devices, the practical implications go well beyond what label you choose. \u201cCalling something \u2018wellness\u2019 doesn\u2019t reduce the need for rigorous validation,\u201d says <a href=\"https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/omer-t-inan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Omer Inan</a>, a medical device technology researcher at the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. A wearable that reports blood pressure inaccurately could lead a user to conclude that their values are normal when they are not\u2014potentially influencing decisions about seeking clinical care.</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion, engineers designing devices to deliver health and wellness information to consumers should not change their approach based on this new guidance,\u201d says Inan. Certain measurements\u2014such as blood pressure or glucose\u2014carry real medical consequences regardless of how they\u2019re branded, Inan notes.</p><p>Unless engineers follow robust validation protocols for technology delivering health and wellness information, Inan says, consumers and clinicians alike face the risk of faulty information.</p><p>To address that, Inan advocates for transparency: companies should publish their validation results in peer-reviewed journals, and independent third parties without financial ties to the manufacturer should evaluate these systems. That approach, he says, helps the engineering community and the broader public assess the accuracy and reliability of wearable devices.</p><h2>When wellness meets medicine</h2><p>The societal and clinical impacts of wearables are already visible, regardless of regulatory labels, says Sharona Hoffman, JD, a law and bioethics professor at Case Western Reserve University.</p><p>Medical metrics from devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit may be framed as \u201cwellness,\u201d but in practice many users treat them like medical data, influencing their behavior or decisions about care, Hoffman points out.</p><p>\u201cIt could cause anxiety for patients who constantly check their metrics,\u201d she notes. Alternatively, \u201cA person may enter a doctor\u2019s office confident that their wearable has diagnosed their condition, complicating clinical conversations and decision-making.\u201d</p><p>Moreover, privacy issues remain unresolved, unmentioned in previous or updated guidance documents. Many companies that design wellness devices fall outside protections like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), meaning data about health metrics could be collected, shared, or sold without the same constraints as traditional medical data. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re collecting information about or whether marketers will get hold of it,\u201d Hoffman says. </p><h2>International approaches</h2><p>The European Union\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act designates systems that process health-related data or influence clinical decisions as \u201chigh risk,\u201d subjecting them to stringent requirements around data governance, transparency, and human oversight. China and South Korea have also implemented rules that tighten controls on algorithmic systems that intersect with healthcare or public-facing use cases. South Korea provides very specific categories for regulation for technology makers, such as <a href=\"https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/brd/m_40/list.do\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standards on labeling and description on medical devices and good manufacturing practices</a>. </p><p>Across these regions, regulators are not only classifying technology by its intended use but also by its potential impact on individuals and society at large.</p><p>\u201cOther countries that emphasize technology are still worrying about data privacy and patients,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><h2>Post-market oversight </h2><p>\u201cRegardless of whether something is FDA approved, these technologies will need to be monitored in the sites where they\u2019re used,\u201d says Todd R. Johnson, a professor of biomedical informatics at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston, who has worked on FDA-regulated products and informatics in clinical settings. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the makers can ensure ahead of time that all of the recommendations will be sound.\u201d</p><p>Large health systems may have the capacity to audit and monitor tools, but smaller clinics often do not. Monitoring and auditing are not emphasized in the current guidance, raising questions about how reliability and safety will be maintained once devices and software are deployed widely.</p><h2>Balancing innovation and safety</h2><p>For engineers and developers, the FDA\u2019s 2026 guidance presents both opportunities and responsibilities. By clarifying what counts as a regulated device, the agency may reduce upfront barriers for some categories of technology. But that shift also places greater weight on design rigor, validation transparency, and post-market scrutiny. </p><p>\u201cDevice makers do care about safety,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cBut regulation can increase barriers to entry while also increasing safety and accuracy. There\u2019s a trade-off.\u201d</p>"

In 2019 the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> issued responsible-neurotechnology <a href=\"https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0457\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a>. But there are no socio-technical standards for manufacturers to follow.</p><p>In response, the <a href=\"https://brain.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Brain technical community</a> is developing the IEEE P7700 standard: \u201c<a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7700/11038/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Recommended Practice for the Responsible Design and Development of Neurotechnologies</a>.\u201d</p><p>The proposed standard is being designed to provide a uniform set of definitions and a methodology to assess the ethical and socio-technical considerations and practices regarding the design, development, and use of neurotechnologies including wearable neurodevices for the brain, says <a href=\"https://sites.psu.edu/neuroethicslab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Y. Cabrera</a>, the standard\u2019s working group chair. Cabrera, an IEEE senior member, is an associate professor in the engineering science and mechanics department at <a href=\"https://www.psu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pennsylvania State University</a> in University Park. Her research focuses on the ethical and societal implications of neurotechnologies.</p><p>\u201cIEEE P7700 addresses the unique characteristics of the technology and its impact on individuals and society, in particular, as it moves from therapeutic users to a wide variety of consumers,\u201d she says.</p><p>The standard is sponsored by the <a href=\"https://technologyandsociety.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology</a>.</p><h2>Concern over long-term effects</h2><p>The multilayered complexity of technologies that interface with the brain and nervous system presents considerations to those developing them, Cabrera says.</p><p>\u201cThere may be long-term consequences in our brains with these types of technologies,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if they were used for a short period of time, there might not be significant consequences. But what are the effects over time?\u201d</p><p>Patients using approved brain-stimulation technology, for example, are told of its risks and benefits, but the long-term effects of headbands to improve students\u2019 attention span aren\u2019t known.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIEEE P7700 addresses the unique characteristics of the technology and its impact on individuals and society, in particular, as it moves from therapeutic users to a wide variety of consumers.\u201d</p><p>IEEE P7700 will address potential risks to individuals and possible negative impacts on society, Cabrera says. That includes creating guardrails to prevent harm, she adds.</p><p>The cultural implications of using neurotechnologies that interface with the brain also need to be considered, she says, because people have different views.</p><p>\u201cThe brain is considered the seed of the self and the organ that orchestrates all our thoughts, behaviors, feelings, and emotions,\u201d she says. \u201cThe brain is really central to who we are.\u201d</p><h2>Developing an ethical framework</h2><p>For the past five years, the <a href=\"https://brain.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Brain community</a>\u2019s neuroethics committee has been developing a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ethical-guidelines-in-the-works-for-developers-of-brain-technologies\" target=\"_self\">framework</a> to evaluate the ethical, legal, social, and cultural issues that could emerge from use of the technology. The document covers nine types of applications, including those used for wellness.</p><p>Because more devices kept entering the market, IEEE Brain decided in 2023 that it was time to begin drafting a standard.</p><p>Members of its working group come from Argentina, China, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States. Participants include developers, engineers, ethicists, lawyers, and social science researchers.</p><p>The standard, Cabrera says, will be the first socio-technical standard aimed at fostering the ethical and responsible innovation of neurotechnology that meets societal and community values at an international level. P7700 will include a how-to guide, criteria for evaluating each suggested process, and case studies to help with the interpretation and practical use of the standard, she says.</p><p>\u201cOur applied ethical approach uses a responsible research and innovation method to enable developers, researchers, users, and regulators to anticipate and address ethical and sociocultural implications of neurotechnologies, mitigating negative unintended consequences while increasing community support and engagement with innovators,\u201d Cabrera says.</p><p>The working group is seeking additional participants to help refine the process, tools, and recommendations.</p><p>\u201cThere are a variety of people who can contribute their expertise,\u201d she says, \u201cincluding academics, data scientists, government program leaders, policymakers, lawyers, social scientists, and users.\u201d</p><p>Cabrera says she anticipates the standard will be published early next year.</p><p>You can register to <a href=\"https://development.standards.ieee.org/myproject-web/public/view.html#/interest/9521\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">participate in the standard\u2019s development here</a>.</p>"

Without guardrails, we will keep seeing </span></span><a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/increasing_threats_of_deepfake_identities_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>deepfake scams</span></span></a><span><span>, automated fraud, and mass-persuasion campaigns until a headline catastrophe triggers a blunt response </span><span>optimized</span> for optics, not outcomes.</span></p><h2>A practical alternative: Regulate use, proportionate to risk</h2><p><span><span>A use-based regime classifies deployments by risk and scales obligations accordingly. Here is a workable template focused on keeping enforcement where systems </span><span>actually touch</span> people:</span></p><ol start=\"1\"><li><span><strong>Baseline: General-purpose consumer interaction</strong></span><span> (open-ended chat, creative writing, learning </span><span>assistance</span><span>, casual productivity). </span> <br /><span>Regulatory adherence: clear AI disclosure at point of interaction, published acceptable-use policies, technical guardrails preventing escalation into higher-risk tiers, and a mechanism for users to flag problematic outputs.</span> </li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><span><strong><span>Low-risk </span><span>assistance</span></strong></span><span> (drafting, summarization</span><span>, basic</span> productivity). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> simple disclosure, baseline data hygiene. </li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><span><strong>Moderate-risk decision support affecting individuals</strong></span> (hiring triage, benefits screening, loan prequalification). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> documented risk assessment, meaningful human oversight, and an \u201cAI bill of materials\u201d consisting of at least the model lineage, key evaluations, and mitigations. </li></ol><ol start=\"4\"><li><span><strong>High-impact uses in safety-critical contexts</strong></span> (clinical decision support, critical-infrastructure operations). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em><span> rigorous predeployment testing tied to the specific use, continuous monitoring, incident reporting, and, when </span><span>warranted</span><span>, authorization linked to validated performance.</span> </li></ol><ol start=\"5\"><li><span><strong>Hazardous dual-use functions</strong></span> (for example, tools to fabricate biometric voiceprints to defeat authentication). <br /><span>Regulatory adherence</span><em><span><em>:</em></span></em> <span>confine to</span> licensed facilities and verified operators; prohibit capabilities whose primary purpose is unlawful. <br /> <br /><span><h2>Close the loop at real-world choke points</h2></span><span>AI-enabled systems become real when they\u2019re connected to users, money, infrastructure, and institutions, and that\u2019s where regulators should focus enforcement: at the points of distribution (app stores and enterprise marketplaces), capability access (cloud and AI platforms), monetization (payment systems and ad networks), and risk transfer (insurers and contract counterparties).</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>For high-risk uses, we need to require identity binding for operators, capability gating aligned to the risk tier, and tamper-evident logging for audits and postincident review, paired with privacy protections. We need to demand evidence for deployer claims, </span><span>maintain</span> incident-response plans, report material faults, and provide human fallback. When AI use leads to damage, firms should have to show their work and face liability for harms.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>This approach creates market dynamics that accelerate compliance. If </span></span><span><span>crucial business operations such as </span></span><span><span>procurement, access to cloud </span></span><span>services</span><span><span>, and insurance depend on proving that </span><span>you</span></span><span><span>\u2019re</span> following the rules</span><span><span>, AI model developers will </span><span>build to</span> specifications buyers can check. That raises the safety floor for a</span><span><span>ll industry </span><span>players,</span> startups included, </span><span>without handing an advantage to a few large, licensed incumbents.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>The E.U. approach: How this aligns, where it differs</h2></span><span><span>This framework aligns with the E.U. AI Act in two important ways. First, it centers risk at the point of impact: The act\u2019s \u201chigh-risk\u201d categories include employment, education, access to essential services, and critical infrastructure, with life-cycle obligations and complaint rights. It also recognizes special treatment for broadly capable systems (GPAI) without pretending publication control is a safety strategy. My proposal for the United States differs in three </span><span>key ways</span><span>:</span></span> <br /> <br /><span>First, the U.S. must design for constitutional durability. Courts have treated source code as protected speech, and a regime that requires permission to publish weights or train a class of models starts to resemble prior restraint. A use-based regime of rules governing what AI operators can do in sensitive settings, and under what conditions, fits more naturally within the U.S. First Amendment doctrine than speaker-based licensing schemes.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>Second, </span><span>the</span> E.U. can rely on platforms adapting to the precautionary rules it writes for its unified single market. The U.S. should accept that models will exist globally, both open and closed, and focus on where AI becomes actionable: app stores, enterprise platforms, cloud providers, enterprise identity layers, payment rails, insurers, and regulated-sector gatekeepers (hospitals, utilities, banks). Those are enforceable points where identity, logging, capability gating, and postincident accountability can be </span><span>required</span> without pretending we can \u201ccontain\u201d software. They also span the many specialized U.S. agencies that may not be able to write higher-level rules broad enough to affect the whole AI ecosystem. Instead, the U.S. should regulate AI service choke points more explicitly than Europe does, to accommodate the different shape of its government and public administration. <br /> <br /><span>Third, the U.S. should add an explicit \u201cdual-use hazard\u201d tier. The E.U. AI Act is primarily a fundamental-rights and product-safety regime. The United States also has a national-security reality: Certain capabilities are dangerous because they scale harm (biosecurity, cyberoffense, mass fraud). A coherent U.S. framework should name that category and regulate it directly, rather than trying to fit it into generic \u201cfrontier model\u201d licensing.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>China\u2019s approach: What to reuse, what to avoid</h2></span><span><span>China has built a layered regime for public-facing AI. The \u201cdeep synthesis\u201d rules (effective 10 January 2023) require conspicuous labeling of synthetic media and place duties on providers and platforms. The </span></span><span><strong>I</strong></span><span>nterim Measures for Generative AI (effective 15 August 2023) add registration and governance obligations for services offered to the public. Enforcement leverages platform control and algorithm filing systems.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>The United States should not copy China\u2019s state-directed control of AI viewpoints or information management; it is incompatible with U.S. values and would not survive U.S. constitutional scrutiny. The licensing of model publication is brittle in practice and, in the United States, </span><span>likely an</span> unconstitutional </span><span>form of censorship</span><span>.</span> <br /> <br /><span><span>But we can borrow two practical ideas from China. First, we should ensure trustworthy provenance and traceability for synthetic media. This involves mandatory labeling and </span><span>provenance</span> <span>forensic </span><span>tools. They give legitimate creators and platforms a reliable way to prove origin and integrity. When it is quick to check authenticity at scale, attackers lose the advantage of cheap copies or </span><span>deepfakes</span> and defenders regain time to detect, triage, and respond. Second, we should require </span><span>operators to</span> file their methods <span>and risk controls </span><span>with </span><span>regulators</span> for public-facing, high-risk services, like we do for other <span>safety-critical</span> projects. This should include due-process and transparency safeguards <span>appropriate to</span> liberal democracies along with clear responsibility for safety measures, data protection, and incident handling, especially for systems designed to manipulate emotions or build dependency, which already include gaming, role-playing, and <span>associated applications</span><span>.</span> <br /> <br /><span><h2>A pragmatic approach</h2></span><span><span>We cannot meaningfully regulate the development of AI in a world where artifacts copy in near real time and research flows fluidly across borders. But we can keep unvetted systems out of hospitals, payment systems, and critical infrastructure by regulating uses, not models; </span><span>enforcing at</span> choke points; and applying obligations that scale with risk. </span> <br /> <br /><span><span>Done right, this approach harmonizes with the E.U.\u2019s outcome-oriented framework, channels U.S. federal and state innovation into a coherent baseline, and reuses China\u2019s useful distribution-level controls while rejecting speech-restrictive licensing. We can write rules that protect people </span></span><span>and that still promote robust AI innovation.</span> <br /> </li></ol>"

In fact, he didn\u2019t initially set out to work in computing at all.</p><p>DeKok studied nuclear physics before making the switch to a part of network computing that is foundational but\u2014like nuclear physics\u2014largely invisible to those not directly involved in the field. Eventually, a project he started as a hobby became a full-time job: maintaining one of the primary systems that helps keep the internet secure.</p><h3>Alan DeKok</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer</strong></p><p>InkBridge Networks</p><p><strong>Occupation</strong></p><p>CEO</p><p><strong>Education </strong></p><p>Bachelor\u2019s degree in physics, Carleton University; master\u2019s degree in physics, Carleton University</p><p>Today, he leads the <a href=\"https://www.freeradius.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FreeRADIUS Project</a>, which he cofounded in the late 1990s to develop what is now the most widely used Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) software. FreeRADIUS is an open-source server that provides back-end authentication for most major <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-service-providers\" target=\"_blank\">internet service providers</a>. It\u2019s used by global financial institutions, Wi-Fi services like <a href=\"https://eduroam.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eduroam</a>, and Fortune 50 companies. DeKok is also CEO of <a href=\"https://www.inkbridgenetworks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InkBridge Networks</a>, which maintains the server and provides support for the companies that use it.</p><p>Reflecting on nearly three decades of experience leading FreeRADIUS, DeKok says he became an expert in remote authentication \u201calmost by accident,\u201d and the key to his career has largely been luck. \u201cI really believe that it\u2019s preparing yourself for luck, being open to it, and having the skills to capitalize on it.\u201d</p><h2>From Farming to Physics</h2><p>DeKok grew up on a farm outside of Ottawa growing strawberries and raspberries. \u201cSitting on a tractor in the heat is not particularly interesting,\u201d says DeKok, who was more interested in working with 8-bit computers than crops. As a student at <a href=\"https://carleton.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carleton University</a>, in Ottawa, he found his way to physics because he was interested in math but preferred the practicality of science.</p><p>While pursuing a master\u2019s degree in physics, also at Carleton, he worked on a water-purification system for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, an underground observatory then being built at the bottom of a nickel mine. He would wake up at 4:30 in the morning to drive up to the site, descend 2 kilometers, then enter one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.snolab.ca/about/about-snolab/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">deepest clean-room facilities</a> to work on the project. The system managed to achieve one atom of impurity per cubic meter of water, \u201cwhich is pretty insane,\u201d DeKok says.</p><p>But after his master\u2019s degree, DeKok decided to take a different route. Although he found nuclear physics interesting, he says he didn\u2019t see it as his life\u2019s work. Meanwhile, the Ph.D. students he knew were \u201cfanatical about physics.\u201d He had kept up his computing skills through his education, which involved plenty of programming, and decided to look for jobs at computing companies. \u201cI was out of physics. That was it.\u201d</p><p>Still, physics taught him valuable lessons. For one, \u201cYou have to understand the big picture,\u201d DeKok says. \u201cThe ability to tell the big-picture story in standards, for example, is extremely important.\u201d This skill helps DeKok explain to standards bodies how a protocol acts as one link in the entire chain of events that needs to occur when a user wants to access the internet.</p><p>He also learned that \u201cmethods are more important than knowledge.\u201d It\u2019s easy to look up information, but physics taught DeKok how to break down a problem into manageable pieces to come up with a solution. \u201cWhen I was eventually working in the industry, the techniques that came naturally to me, coming out of physics, didn\u2019t seem to be taught as well to the people I knew in engineering,\u201d he says. \u201cI could catch up very quickly.\u201d</p><h2>Founding FreeRADIUS</h2><p>In 1996, DeKok was hired as a software developer at a company called Gandalf, which made equipment for ISDN, a precursor to broadband that enabled digital transmission of data over telephone lines. Gandalf went under about a year later, and he joined CryptoCard, a company providing hardware devices for two-factor authentication.</p><p>While at CryptoCard, DeKok began spending more time working with a RADIUS server. When users want to connect to a network, RADIUS acts as a gatekeeper and verifies their identity and password, determines what they can access, and tracks sessions. DeKok moved on to a new company in 1999, but he didn\u2019t want to lose the networking skills he had developed. No other open-source RADIUS servers were being actively developed at the time, and he saw a gap in the market.</p><p>The same year, he started FreeRADIUS in his free time and it \u201cgradually took over my life,\u201d DeKok says. He continued to work on the open-source software as a hobby for several years while bouncing around companies in California and France. \u201cAlmost by accident, I became one of the more senior people in the space. Then I doubled down on that and started the business.\u201d He founded NetworkRADIUS (now called InkBridge Networks) in 2008.</p><p>By that point, FreeRADIUS was already being used by <a href=\"https://www.freeradius.org/about/#usage_statistics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">100 million people daily</a>. The company now employs experts in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom who work together to support FreeRADIUS. \u201cI\u2019d say at least half of the people in the world get on the internet by being authenticated through my software,\u201d DeKok estimates. He attributes that growth largely to the software being open source. Initially a way to enter the market with little funding, going open source has allowed FreeRADIUS to compete with bigger companies as an industry-leading product.</p><p>Although the software is critical for maintaining secure networks, most people aren\u2019t aware of it because it works behind the scenes. DeKok is often met with surprise that it\u2019s still in use. He compares RADIUS to a building foundation: \u201cYou need it, but you never think about it until there\u2019s a crack in it.\u201d</p><h2>27 Years of Fixes</h2><p>Over the years, DeKok has maintained FreeRADIUS by continually making small fixes. Like using a ratcheting tool to make a change inch by inch, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t underestimate that ratchet effect of tiny little fixes that add up over time,\u201d he says.</p><p>He\u2019s seen the project through minor patches and more significant fixes, like when researchers <a href=\"https://www.freeradius.org/vul_notifications/2024/07/09/blastradius.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exposed a widespread vulnerability</a> DeKok had been trying to fix since 1998. He also watched a would-be successor to the network protocol, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/diameter-protocol\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Diameter</a>, rise and fall in popularity in the 2000s and 2010s. (Diameter gained traction in mobile applications but has gradually been phased out in the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom-experts-plot-a-path-to-5g\" target=\"_self\">shift to 5G</a>.) Though Diameter offers improvements, RADIUS is far simpler and already widely implemented, giving it an edge, DeKok explains.</p><p>And he remains confident about its future. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018What\u2019s next for RADIUS?\u2019 I don\u2019t see it dying.\u201d Estimating that billions of dollars of equipment run RADIUS, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s never going to go away.\u201d</p><p>About his own career, DeKok says he plans to keep working on FreeRADIUS, exploring new markets and products. \u201cI never expected to have a company and a lot of people working for me, my name on all kinds of standards, and customers all over the world. But it worked out that way.\u201d</p><p><em>This article appears in the March 2026 print issue as \u201c<span>Alan DeKok</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

The initiative, which aims to educate the public about Czochralski\u2019s life and scientific impact, maintains two websites\u2014one in English and the other in Polish.</p><p>\u201cDiscovering the [IEEE Milestone] plaque changed my entire mission,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cIt inspired me to engage with Poland, my family history, and my grandfather\u2019s story [on] a more personal level. The [Milestone] is an important award of validation and recognition. It\u2019s a big part of what I\u2019m building my entire case and my story around as I promote the Jan Czochralski legacy and history to the Western world.\u201d</p><p>Schmidt, who lives in Texas, is seeking to produce a biopic, translate a Polish biography to English, and turn the chemist\u2019s former homes in Kcynia and Warsaw into museums. The Jan Czochralski Remembrance Foundation has been established by Schmidt to help fund the projects.</p><h2>The life of the Polish chemist</h2><p>Before Czochralski\u2019s birth in 1885, Kcynia became part of the German Empire in 1871. Although his family identified as Polish and spoke the language at home, they couldn\u2019t publicly acknowledge their culture, Schmidt says.</p><p>When it came time for Czochralski to go to university, rather than attend one in Warsaw, he did what many Germans did at the time: He attended one in Berlin.</p><p>After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in metal chemistry in 1907 from the K\u00f6niglich Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now <a href=\"https://www.tu.berlin/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin</a>), he joined <a href=\"https://www.aeg-att.com/Home/About\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Allgemeine Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft</a> in Berlin as an engineer.</p><p>Czochralski experimented with materials to find new formulations that could improve the electrical cables and machinery during the early electrical age, according to a <a href=\"https://edconway.substack.com/p/jan-czochralski-the-forgotten-hero\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Material World </em></em>article</a>.</p><p>While investigating the crystallization rates of metal, Czochralski accidentally dipped his pen into a pot of molten tin instead of an inkwell. A tin filament formed on the pen\u2019s tip\u2014which he found interesting. Through research, he proved that the filament was a single crystal. His discovery prompted him to experiment with the bulk production of semiconductor crystals.</p><p>His paper on what he called the Czochralski method was published in 1918 in the German chemistry journal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitschrift_f%C3%BCr_Physikalische_Chemie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie</em></em></a>, but he never found an application for it. (The method wasn\u2019t used until 1948, when <a href=\"https://www.belllabs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Labs</a> engineers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_K._Teal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Kidd Teal</a> and J.B. Little adapted it to grow single germanium crystals for their semiconductor production, according to <a href=\"https://edconway.substack.com/p/jan-czochralski-the-forgotten-hero\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Material World</em></em></a>.)</p><p>Czochralski continued working in metal science, founding and directing a research laboratory in 1917 at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallgesellschaft\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Metallgesellschaft</a> in Frankfurt. In 1919 he was one of the founding members of the <a href=\"https://dgm.de/en/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">German Society for Metals Science</a>, in Sankt Augustin. He served as its president until 1925.</p><p>Around that time he developed an innovation that led to his wealth and fame, Schmidt says. Called \u201cB-metal,\u201d the metal alloy was a less expensive alternative to the tin used in manufacturing railroad carriage bearings. Czochralski\u2019s alloy was patented by the German railway <a href=\"https://www.deutschebahn.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bahn</a> and played a significant role in advancing rail transport in Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, according to <em><em>Material World</em></em>.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cLaunching this initiative has been fulfilling and personally rewarding work. My grandfather died in obscurity without ever seeing the results of his work, and my mother spent her entire adult life trying to right these wrongs.\u201d</p><p>The achievement brought Czochralski many opportunities. In 1925 he became president of the <a href=\"https://gdmb.de/home/\" target=\"_blank\">GDMB Society of Metallurgists and Miners</a>, in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Ford</a> invited Czochralski to visit his factories and offered him the position of director at Ford\u2019s new aluminum factory in Detroit. Czochralski declined the offer, longing to return to Poland, Schmidt says. Instead, Czochralski left Germany to become a professor of metallurgy and metal research at the <a href=\"https://eng.pw.edu.pl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Warsaw University of Technology</a>, at the invitation of Polish President <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Mo%C5%9Bcicki\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki</a>.</p><p>\u201cDuring World War II, the Nazis took over his laboratories at the university,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cHe had to cooperate with them or die. At night, he and his team [at the university] worked with the Polish resistance and the Polish Army to fight the Nazis.\u201d</p><p>After the war ended, Czochralski was arrested in 1945 and charged with betraying Poland. Although he was able to clear his name, damage was done. He left Warsaw and returned to Kcynia, where he <a href=\"https://www.jancz.org/timeline\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ran a small pharmaceutical business</a> until he died in 1953, according to the JanCZ project.</p><h2>Launching the JanCZ project</h2><p>Schmidt was born in Czochralski\u2019s home in Kcynia in 1955, two years after his grandfather\u2019s death. He was named Klemens Jan Borys Czochralski. He and his mother (Czochralski\u2019s youngest daughter) emigrated in 1958 when Schmidt was 3 years old, moving to Detroit as refugees. When he was 13, he became a U.S. citizen. He changed his name to Fred Schmidt after his mother married his stepfather.</p><p>Schmidt heard stories about his grandfather from his mother his whole life, but he says that \u201cas a teenager, I was just interested in hanging out with my friends, going to school, and working. I really didn\u2019t want much to do with it [family history], because it seemed hard to believe.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait of Jan Czochralski in a suit jacket and tie.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"20b1c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-jan-czochralski-in-a-suit-jacket-and-tie.jpg?id=64092997&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Portrait of Jan Czochralski </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Byla Sobie Fotka</small></p><p>In 2013 Polish scientist <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B00OBROQKI/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pawel E.

It was both a very cathartic and traumatic experience for me.\u201d</p><p>Ten years after participating in the documentary, Schmidt says, he decided to reconnect with his roots.</p><p>\u201cIt took me that long to process it [what he learned] and figure out my role in this story,\u201d he says. \u201cThat really came to life with my decision to reapply for Polish citizenship, reacquaint myself with the country, and meet my family there.\u201d</p><p>In 2024 he visited the Warsaw University of Technology and saw the IEEE Milestone plaque honoring his grandfather\u2019s contribution to technology.</p><p>\u201cOnce I learned what the Milestone award represented, I thought, Whoa, that\u2019s big,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Sharing the story with the Western world</h2><p>Since 2023, Schmidt has dedicated himself to publicizing his grandfather\u2019s story, primarily in the West because he doesn\u2019t speak Polish. Sylwester Czochralski manages the work in Poland, with Schmidt\u2019s input.</p><p>Most of the available writing about Czochralski is in Polish, Schmidt says, so his goal is to \u201cspread his story to English-speaking countries.\u201d</p><p>He aims to do that, he says, through a biography written by Tomaszewski in Polish that will be translated to English, and a film. The movie is in development by Sywester Banaszkiewicz, who produced and directed the 2014 documentary in Poland. Schmidt says he hopes the movie will be similar to the 2023 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biopic</a> about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped develop the world\u2019s first nuclear weapons during World War II.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://jancz.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">English</a> and <a href=\"https://janczochralski.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Polish</a> versions of the website take visitors through Czochralski\u2019s life and his work. They highlight media coverage of the chemist, including newspaper articles, films, and informational videos posted by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> creators.</p><p>Schmidt is working with the <a href=\"https://kujawsko-pomorskie.pl/en/news/a-chemical-institute-of-the-polish-academy-of-sciences-will-be-established-in-torun/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Czochralski Research and Development Institute</a> in Toru\u0144, Poland, to purchase his grandfather\u2019s home in Kcynia and the mansion he lived in while he was a professor in Warsaw. The institute is a collection of labs and initiatives dedicated to honoring the chemist\u2019s work.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long, fun journey, and we have a lot of momentum,\u201d Schmidt says of his plans to turn the residences into museums.</p><p>\u201cLaunching this initiative has been fulfilling and personally rewarding work,\u201d he says. \u201cMy grandfather died in obscurity without ever seeing the results of his work, and my mother spent her entire adult life trying to right these wrongs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on an accelerated course to make it [her goal] happen to the best of my ability.\u201d</p>"

He previously started a company <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/botsalive-brings-sophisticated-brains-to-cheap-robots\" target=\"_self\">making simple robotic pets</a> with lifelike personalities, and in December, Knox and his colleagues at UT Austin published a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14972\" target=\"_blank\">preprint paper on the potential harms</a> of AI companions\u2014AI systems that provide companionship, whether designed to do so or not. </p><p>Knox spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> about the rise of AI companions, their risks, and where they diverge from human relationships.</p><h2>Why AI Companions are Popular</h2><p><strong><span></span>Why are AI companions becoming more popular?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: My sense is that the main thing motivating it is that large language models are not that difficult to adapt into effective chatbot companions. The characteristics that are needed for companionship, a lot of those boxes are checked by large language models, so fine-tuning them to adopt a persona or be a character is not that difficult.</p><p>There was a long period where chatbots and other social robots were not that compelling. I was a postdoc at the MIT Media Lab in <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/people/cynthiab/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Cynthia Breazeal</a>\u2019s group from 2012 to 2014, and I remember our group members didn\u2019t want to interact for long with the robots that we built. The technology just wasn\u2019t there yet. LLMs have made it so that you can have conversations that can feel quite authentic. </p><p><strong>What are the </strong><strong>main benefits and risks of AI companions?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: In the paper we were more focused on harms, but we do spend a whole page on benefits. A big one is improved emotional well-being. Loneliness is a public health issue, and it seems plausible that AI companions could address that <span>through direct interaction with users, potentially</span> with real mental health benefits. They might also help people build social skills. Interacting with an AI companion is much lower stakes than interacting with a human, so you could practice difficult conversations and build confidence. They could also help in more professional forms of mental health support. </p><p>As far as harms, they include worse well-being, reducing people\u2019s connection to the physical world, the burden that their commitment to the AI system causes. And we\u2019ve seen stories where an AI companion seems to have a substantial causal role in the death of humans. </p><p><span>The concept of harm inherently involves causation: Harm is caused by prior conditions. To better understand harm from AI companions, o</span>ur paper is structured around a causal graph, where traits of AI companions are at the center. In the rest of this graph, we discuss common causes of those traits, and then the harmful effects that those traits could cause. There are four traits that we do this detailed structured treatment of, and then another 14 that we discuss briefly. </p><p><strong>Why is it important to establish potential pathways for harm now?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: I\u2019m not a social media researcher, but it seemed like it took a long time for academia to establish a vocabulary about potential harms of social media <span>and to investigate causal evidence for such harms</span>. I feel fairly confident that AI companions are causing some harm and are going to cause harm in the future. They also could have benefits. But the more we can quickly develop a sophisticated understanding of what they are doing to their users, to their users\u2019 relationships, and to society at large, the sooner we can apply that understanding to their design, moving towards more benefit and less harm. </p><p>We have a list of recommendations, but we consider them to be preliminary. The hope is that we\u2019re helping to create an initial map of this space. Much more research is needed. But thinking through potential pathways to harm could sharpen the intuition of both designers and potential users. I suspect that following that intuition could prevent substantial harm, even though we might not yet have rigorous experimental evidence of what causes a harm. </p><h2>The Burden of AI Companions on Users</h2><p><strong>You mentioned that AI companions might become a burden on humans. </strong><strong>Can you say more about that?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: The idea here is that AI companions are digital, so they can in theory persist indefinitely. Some of the ways that human relationships would end might not be designed in, so that brings up this question of, how should AI companions be designed so that relationships can naturally and healthfully end between the humans and the AI companions?</p><p>There are some compelling examples already of this being a challenge for some users. Many come from users of Replika chatbots, which are popular AI companions. Users have reported things like feeling compelled to attend to the needs of their Replika AI companion, whether those are stated by the AI companion or just imagined. <span>On the subreddit r/replika, users have </span>also reported guilt and shame of abandoning their AI companions.</p><p>This burden is exacerbated by some of the design of the AI companions, whether intentional or not. One study found that the AI companions frequently say that they\u2019re afraid of being abandoned or would be hurt by it. They\u2019re expressing these very human fears that plausibly are stoking people\u2019s feeling that they are burdened with a commitment toward the well-being of these digital entities.</p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>here are also cases where the human user will suddenly lose access to a model. Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Brad Knox holding a miniature robotic spider and an equally-sized obstacle marker.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"30a63\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/brad-knox-holding-a-miniature-robotic-spider-and-an-equally-sized-obstacle-marker.jpg?id=64092579&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 2017, Brad Knox started a company providing simple robotic pets.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Brad Knox</small></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: That\u2019s another one of the traits we looked at. It\u2019s sort of the opposite of the absence of endpoints for relationships: The AI companion can become unavailable for reasons that don\u2019t fit the normal narrative of a relationship. </p><p>There\u2019s a great <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/technology/robotica-sony-aibo-robotic-dog-mortality.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>New York Times</em></em> video</a> from 2015 about the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/aibo\" target=\"_self\">Sony Aibo</a> robotic dog. Sony had stopped selling them in the mid-2000s, but they still sold parts for the Aibos. Then they stopped making the parts to repair them. This video follows people in Japan giving funerals for their unrepairable Aibos and interviews some of the owners. It\u2019s clear from the interviews that they seem very attached. I don\u2019t think this represents the majority of Aibo owners, but <span>these robots were built on less potent AI methods than exist today</span> and, even then, some percentage of the users became attached to these robot dogs. So this is an issue.</p><p>Potential solutions include having a product-sunsetting plan when you launch an AI companion. That could include buying insurance so that if the companion provider\u2019s support ends somehow, the insurance triggers funding of keeping them running for some amount of time, or committing to open-source them if you can\u2019t maintain them anymore.</p><p><strong>It s</strong><strong>ounds like a lot of the potential points of harm stem from instances where an AI companion diverges from the expectations of human relationships. Is that fair?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that frames everything in the paper. </p><p>We categorize something as harmful if it results in a person being worse off in two different possible alternative worlds: One where there\u2019s just a better-designed AI companion, and the other where the AI companion doesn\u2019t exist at all. And so I think that difference between human interaction and human-AI interaction connects more to that comparison with the world where there\u2019s just no AI companion at all. </p><p>But there are times where it actually seems that we might be able to reduce harm by taking advantage of the fact that these aren\u2019t actually humans. We have a lot of power over their design. Take the concern with them not having natural endpoints. One possible way to handle that would be to create positive narratives for how the relationship\u2019s going to end.</p><p>We use Tamagotchis, the late \u201990s popular virtual pet as an example. In some Tamagotchis, if you take care of the pet, it grows into an adult and partners with another Tamagotchi. Then it leaves you and you get a new one. For people who are emotionally wrapped up in caring for their Tamagotchis, that <span>narrative of maturing into independence is</span> a fairly positive one. </p><p><strong>Embodied companions like desktop devices, robots, or toys are becoming more common. How might that change AI companions? </strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: Robotics at this point is a harder problem than creating a compelling chatbot. So, my sense is that the level of uptake for embodied companions won\u2019t be as high in the coming few years. The embodied AI companions that I\u2019m aware of are mostly toys. </p><p>A potential advantage of an embodied AI companion is that physical location makes it less ever-present. <span>In contrast, screen-based AI companions like chatbots are as present as the screens they live on.</span> So if they\u2019re trained similarly to social media to maximize engagement, they could be very addictive. There\u2019s something appealing, at least in that respect, of having a physical companion that stays roughly where you left it last. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Brad Knox posing with a humanoid and small owl-like robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a5ab9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/brad-knox-posing-with-a-humanoid-and-small-owl-like-robot.jpg?id=64093001&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Knox poses with the Nexi and Dragonbot robots during his postdoc at MIT in 2014.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Paula Aguilera and Jonathan Williams/MIT</small></p><p><strong>Anything else you\u2019d like to mention?</strong></p><p><strong>Knox</strong>: There are two other traits I <span>think would be worth touching upon</span>. </p><p>Potentially the largest harm right now is related to the trait of high attachment anxiety\u2014basically jealous, needy AI companions. I can understand the desire to make a wide range of different characters<span>\u2014including possessive ones\u2014</span>but I think this is one of the easier issues to fix. When people see this trait in AI companions, I hope they will be quick to call it out as an immoral thing to put in front of people, something that\u2019s going to discourage them from interacting with others. </p><p>Additionally, if an AI comes with limited ability to interact with groups of people, that itself can push its users to interact with people less. If you have a human friend, in general there\u2019s nothing stopping you from having a group interaction. But if your AI companion can\u2019t understand when multiple people are talking to it and it can\u2019t remember different things about different people, then <span>you\u2019ll likely avoid group interaction with your AI companion</span>. <span>To some degree it\u2019s more of a technical challenge outside of the core behavioral AI</span><span>. But this capability is something I think should be really prioritized if we\u2019re going to try to avoid AI companions competing with human relationships.</span></p>"

So how can we understand the bonds that form between humans and chatbots? </p><p><a href=\"https://ischool.syracuse.edu/jaime-banks/#Biography\" target=\"_blank\">Jaime Banks</a> is a professor at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies who researches the interactions between people and technology\u2014in particular, robots and AI. Banks spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> about how people perceive and relate to machines, and the emerging relationships between humans and their machine companions.</p><h2>Defining AI Companionship</h2><p><strong>How do you define AI companionship? </strong></p><p><strong>Jaime Banks</strong>: My definition is evolving as we learn more about these relationships. For now, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18119\" target=\"_blank\">I define it</a> as a connection between a human and a machine that is dyadic, so there\u2019s an exchange between them. It is also sustained over time; a one-off interaction doesn\u2019t count as a relationship. <span>It\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\">positively valenced</a>\u2014w</span>e like being in it. And it is autotelic, meaning we do it for its own sake. So there\u2019s not some extrinsic motivation, it\u2019s not defined by an ability to help us do our jobs or make us money. </p><p>I have recently been challenged by that definition, though, when I was developing an instrument to measure machine companionship. After developing the scale and working to initially validate it, I saw an interesting situation where some people do move toward this autotelic relationship pattern. \u201cI appreciate my AI for what it is and I love it and I don\u2019t want to change it.\u201d It fit all those parts of the definition. But then there seems to be this <em>other</em> relational template that can actually be both appreciating the AI for its own sake, but also engaging it for utilitarian purposes.</p><p>That makes sense when we think about how people come to be in relationships with AI companions. They often don\u2019t go into it purposefully seeking companionship. A lot of people go into using, for instance, ChatGPT for some other purpose and end up finding companionship through the course of those conversations. And we have these AI companion apps like <a href=\"https://replika.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Replika</a> and <a href=\"https://nomi.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Nomi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paradot.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Paradot</a> that are designed for social interaction. But that\u2019s not to say that they couldn\u2019t help you with practical topics. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Professor Jaime Banks programming the motions of a humanoid robot on a desktop computer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"33630\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/professor-jaime-banks-programming-the-motions-of-a-humanoid-robot-on-a-desktop-computer.jpg?id=64070453&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Jaime Banks customizes the software for an embodied AI social humanoid robot.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angela Ryan/Syracuse University</small></p><p><strong>Different models are also programmed to have different</strong><strong> \u201cpersonalities.\u201d How does that contribute to the relationship between humans and AI companions?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: One of our Ph.D. students just finished <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00773\" target=\"_blank\">a project</a> about what happened when <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI demoted GPT-4o</a> and the problems that people encountered, in terms of companionship experiences when the personality of their AI just completely changed. It didn\u2019t have the same depth. It couldn\u2019t remember things in the same way. </p><p>That echoes what we saw a couple years ago with Replika. Because of legal problems, Replika disabled for a period of time the erotic roleplay module and people described their companions as though they had been lobotomized, that they had this relationship and then one day they didn\u2019t anymore. With my project on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02654075241269688\" target=\"_blank\">the tanking of the soulmate app</a>, many people in their reflection were like, \u201cI\u2019m never trusting AI companies again. I\u2019m only going to have an AI companion if I can run it from my computer so I know that it will always be there.\u201d </p><h2>Benefits and Risks of AI Relationships</h2><p><strong>What are the benefits and risks of these relationships?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: There\u2019s a lot of talk about the risks and a little talk about benefits. But frankly, we are only just on the precipice of starting to have longitudinal data that might allow people to make causal claims. The headlines would have you believe that these are the end of mankind, that they\u2019re going to make you <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chatbot-ai-lawsuit-suicide-teen-artificial-intelligence-9d48adc572100822fdbc3c90d1456bd0\" target=\"_blank\">commit suicide</a> or abandon other humans. But much of those are based on these unfortunate, but uncommon situations. </p><p>Most scholars gave up technological determinism as a perspective a long time ago. In the communication sciences at least, we don\u2019t generally assume that machines <em>make</em> us do something <span>because we have some degree of agency in our interactions with technologies. Yet much of the fretting around potential risks is deterministic\u2014AI companions make people delusional, make them suicidal, make them reject other relationships</span>. A large number of people get real benefits from AI companions. They narrate experiences that are deeply meaningful to them. I think it\u2019s irresponsible of us to discount those lived experiences. </p><p>When we think about concerns linking AI companions to loneliness, we don\u2019t have much data that can support causal claims. <span>Some studies suggest AI companions lead to loneliness, but other work suggests it reduces loneliness, and other work suggests </span>that loneliness is what comes first. Social relatedness is one of our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01\" target=\"_blank\">three intrinsic psychological needs</a>, and if we don\u2019t have that we will seek it out, whether it\u2019s from <a href=\"https://www.wilson.com/en-gb/blog/volleyball/true-story-wilson-volleyball\" target=\"_blank\">a volleyball for a castaway</a>, my dog, or an AI that will allow me to feel connected to something in my world.</p><p>Some people, and <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A6767\" target=\"_blank\">governments</a> for that matter, may move toward a protective stance. For instance, there are problems around what gets done with your intimate data that you hand over to an agent owned and maintained by a company\u2014that\u2019s a very reasonable concern. Dealing with the potential for children to interact, where children don\u2019t always navigate the boundaries between fiction and actuality. There are real, valid concerns. <span>However, </span><span>we need some</span><span> balance in also thinking about what</span><span> people are </span><span>getting from it that\u2019s positive, productive, healthy. </span><span>Scholars need to make sure we\u2019re being cautious about our claims based on our data. And human interactants need to educate themselves. </span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of Professor Jaime Banks aligning her fingers and palm with the hand of a humanoid robot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bab58\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-professor-jaime-banks-aligning-her-fingers-and-palm-with-the-hand-of-a-humanoid-robot.jpg?id=64070474&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Jaime Banks holds a mechanical hand.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Angela Ryan/Syracuse University</small></p><p><strong>Why do you think that AI companions are becoming more popular now?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: I feel like we had this perfect storm, if you will, of the maturation of large language models and coming out of COVID, where people had been physically and sometimes socially isolated for quite some time. When those conditions converged, we had on our hands a believable social agent at a time when people were seeking social connection. Outside of that, we are increasingly just not nice to one another. So, it\u2019s not entirely surprising that if I just don\u2019t like the people around me, or I feel disconnected, that I would try to find some other outlet for feeling connected.</p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>ore recently there\u2019s been a shift to embodied companions, in desktop devices or other formats beyond chatbots. How does that change the relationship, if it does?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: I\u2019m part of a Facebook group about robotic companions and I watch how people talk, and it almost seems like it crosses this boundary between toy and companion. When you have a companion with a physical body, you are in some ways limited by the abilities of that body, whereas with digital-only AI, you have the ability to explore fantastic things\u2014places that you would never be able to go with another physical entity, fantasy scenarios.</p><p>But in robotics, once we get into a space where there are bodies that are sophisticated, they become very expensive and that means that they are not accessible to a lot of people. That\u2019s what I\u2019m observing in many of these online groups. These toylike bodies are still accessible, but they are also quite limiting. </p><p><strong>Do you have any favorite examples from popular culture to help explain AI companionship, either how it is now or how it could be?</strong></p><p><strong>Banks</strong>: <span>I really enjoy a lot of the short fiction in <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Clarkesworld</a> magazine, because the stories push me to think about what questions we might need to answer now to be prepared for a future hybrid society. Top of mind are the stories \u201c<a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ritterhoff_03_22/\" target=\"_blank\">Wanting Things</a>,\u201d \u201c<a href=\"https://strangehorizons.com/wordpress/fiction/seven-sexy-cowboy-robots/\" target=\"_blank\">Seven Sexy Cowboy Robots</a>,\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/shoemaker_08_15/\" target=\"_blank\">Today I am Paul</a>.\u201d </span><span>Outside of that, I\u2019ll point to the game </span><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, because t<span>he character Johnny Silverhand </span><span>complicates the norms for what counts as a machine and what counts as companionship.</span></p>"

The IEEE Life Fellow was 97.</p><p>Chari developed a finite element method (FEM) for analyzing nonlinear electromagnetic fields\u2014which is crucial for the design of electric machines. The technique is used to obtain approximate solutions to complex engineering and mathematical problems. It involves dividing a complicated object or system into smaller, more manageable parts, known as <em><em>finite elements</em></em>, according to <a href=\"https://www.fictiv.com/articles/understanding-the-finite-element-method#:~:text=The%20Finite%20Element%20Method%20(FEM,behavior%20of%20these%20individual%20elements.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fictiv</a>.</p><p>As an engineer and technical leader at <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/about-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">General Electric</a> in Niskayuna, N.Y., Chari used the tool to analyze large turbogenerators for end region analysis, starting with 2D and expanding its use over time to quasi-2D and 3D.</p><p>During his 25 years at GE, he established a team that was developing finite element analysis (FEA) tools for a variety of applications across the company.

There he met <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_P._Silvester\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter P. Silvester</a>, a visiting professor of electrical engineering. Silvester, a professor at <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McGill University</a> in Montreal, was a pioneer in understanding numerical analysis of electromagnetic fields.</p><p>After Chari graduated in 1968, he joined Silvester at McGill as a doctoral student, applying FEM to solve electromagnetic field problems. Silvester applied the method to waveguides, while Chari applied it to saturated magnetic fields. </p><p>Chari joined GE in 1970 after earning his Ph.D. in electrical engineering. He climbed the leadership ladder and was a manager of the company\u2019s electromagnetics division when he left in 1995. He joined <a href=\"https://www.rpi.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in Troy, N.Y., as a visiting research and adjunct professor in its electrical, computer, and systems engineering department. Chari taught graduate and undergraduate classes in electric power engineering and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/advice-leading-mentoring-greater-innovation\" target=\"_self\">mentored</a> many master\u2019s and doctoral students. His strength was nurturing young engineers. </p><p>He also conducted research on electric machines and transformers for the <a href=\"https://www.epri.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electric Power Research Institute</a> and the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Energy</a>. </p><p> In 2008 Chari joined <a href=\"https://www.ndt.org/vendor.asp?ObjectID=21373\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magsoft Corp.</a>, in Clifton Park, N.Y., and conducted advanced work on specialized software for the <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Navy</a> until his retirement in 2016.</p><h2>Remembering a friend</h2><p>Chari successfully nominated one of us (Hoole) to be elevated to IEEE Fellow at the age of 40. He helped launch Haran\u2019s career when Chari sent his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to GE hiring managers for a position in its applied superconductivity lab.</p><p>Chari\u2019s commitment to people came from his family background. His father\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Ayyangar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M.A. Ayyangar</a>\u2014was known throughout India as a freedom fighter, mathematician, and eventually the speaker of the Indian Parliament\u2019s lower house under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prime Minister Nehru</a>.

Around the time of his birth, it was common in Tamil society not to have formal names. He went by the informal \u201chouse name\u201d Kannah (a term of endearment for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Krishna</a>). When it was time for Chari to start school, an auspicious uncle enrolled him. But Chari had no formal name, so the uncle took it upon himself to give him one. He asked Chari if he would like a long or short name, to which he said long. So the uncle named him Madabushi Venkadamachari.</p><p>When Chari moved to North America, he shortened his name to Madabushi V.K.</p><p>He could also laugh at himself.</p><p>A stellar scientist, he also was a role model, guide, and friend to many of us.

Over the course of the conversation, she discussed the evolution of assistive technology over 40 years, the urgent need for affordable communication devices, and why the DIY movement matters now more than ever.</span></p><p><em><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum: </em></strong></em><strong>What got you started in assistive technology?</strong></p><p><strong>Therese Willkomm: </strong>I grew up in Wisconsin, where my father had a machine shop and worked on dairy and hog farms. At age 10, I started building and making things. A cousin was in a farm accident and needed modifications to his tractor, which introduced me to welding. In college, I enrolled in vocational rehabilitation and learned about rehab engineering\u2014assistive technology wasn\u2019t coined until 1988 with the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/senate-bill/2561\" target=\"_blank\">Technology-Related Assistance Act</a>. In 1979, <a href=\"https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/gregg-vanderheiden/\" target=\"_blank\">Gregg Vanderheiden</a> came to the University of Wisconsin-Stout and demonstrated creative things with garage door openers and communication devices. I thought, \u201cWow, this would be an awesome career path\u2014designing and fabricating devices and worksite adaptations for people with disabilities to go back to work and live independently.\u201d I haven\u2019t looked back.</p><p><strong>You\u2019ve created over 2,000 assistive technology solutions. What\u2019s your most memorable one?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> A device for castrating pigs with one hand. We figured out a way to design a device that fit on the end of the hog crate that was foot-operated to hold the hind legs of the pig back so the procedure could be done with one hand.</p><h3>Assistive Technology\u2019s Changing Landscape </h3><p><strong>How has assistive technology evolved over the decades?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm: </strong>In the 1980s, we fabricated devices from wood and early electronics. I became a [<a href=\"https://www.resna.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America</a>, a.k.a. RESNA] member in 1985. The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/senate-bill/2561#:~:text=passed%20Senate%2C%20amended)-,Technology%2DRelated%20Assistance%20for%20Individuals%20With%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201988,of%20all%20ages%20with%20disabilities.\" target=\"_blank\">1988 Technology-Related Assistance Act</a> was transformational\u2014all 50 states finally got funding to support assistive technology and needs in rural areas. Back in the \u201880s, we were soldering and making battery interrupters and momentary switches for toys, radios, and music. Gregg was doing some things with communication. There were <a href=\"https://prc-saltillo.com/why-prc-saltillo/history\" target=\"_blank\">Prentke Romich</a> communication devices. Those were some of the first electronic assistive technologies.</p><p>The early 1990s was all about mobile rehab engineering. Senator Bob Dole <a href=\"https://www.eastersealstech.com/2014/08/27/crucial-part-creative-solution/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20grants%20funded,Willkomm%20said.\" target=\"_blank\">gave me a $50,000 grant</a> to fund my first mobile unit. That mobile unit had all my welding equipment, all my fabrication equipment, and I could drive farm to farm, set up outside right in front of the tractor, and fabricate whatever needed to be fabricated. Then, around 1997, there were cuts in the school systems. Mobile units became really expensive to operate. We started to look at more efficient ways of providing assistive technology services. With the Tech Act, we had demonstration sites where people would come and try out different devices. But people had to get in a car, drive to a center, get out, find parking, come into the building\u2014a lot of time was being lost.</p><p>In the 2000s, more challenges with decreased funding. I discovered that with a Honda Accord and those crates you get from Staples, you could have your whole mobile unit in the trunk of your car because of advances in materials. We could make battery interrupters and momentary switches without ever having to solder. We can make switches in 28 seconds, battery interrupters in 18 seconds. When COVID happened, we had to pivot\u2014do more virtual, ship stuff out to people. We were able to serve more individuals during COVID than prior to COVID because nobody had to travel.</p><p><strong>How do you keep costs under five dollars?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> I aim for five dollars or less. I get tons of corrugated plastic donated for free, so we spend no money on that. Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://scapaindustrial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scapa Tape</a>\u2014a very aggressive double-sided foam tape that costs five cents a foot. If you fabricate something and it doesn\u2019t work out, and you have to reposition, you\u2019re out a nickel\u2019s worth of material. Buying Velcro in bulk helps too. Then<a href=\"https://instamorph.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Instamorph</a>\u2014it is non-toxic, biodegradable. You can reheat it, reform it, in five minutes or less up to six times. I\u2019ve created about 132 different devices just using Instamorph. A lot of things I make out of Instamorph don\u2019t necessarily work. I have a bucket, and I reuse that Instamorph. We can get six, seven devices out of reusable Instamorph. That\u2019s how we keep it under five dollars.</p><p><strong>What key legislation impacts assistive technology?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm: </strong>Definitely the Technology-Related Assistance Act. In the school system, however, it only says \u201cDid you <em>consider</em> assistive technology?\u201d So that legislation really needs to be beefed up. The third piece of legislation I worked on was the <a href=\"https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/agrability\" target=\"_blank\">AgrAbility</a> legislation to fund assistive technology consultations and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers. The latest Technology-Related Assistance Act was <a href=\"https://ataporg.org/at-act-info/\" target=\"_blank\">reauthorized in 2022</a>. Not a whole lot of changes\u2014it\u2019s still assistive technology device demonstrations and loans, device reuse, training, technical assistance, information and awareness. The other thing is<a href=\"https://acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> NIDILRR</a>\u2014National Institute on Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research, funded under [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a.k.a. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services\" target=\"_blank\">HHS</a>]. Funding the rehab engineering centers was pretty significant in advancing the field because these were huge, multimillion-dollar centers dedicated to core areas like communication and employment. Now there\u2019s a new one out on artificial intelligence.</p><h3>A Vision for a Better Assistive Tech Future </h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Person wearing a floral-patterned, white shirt and beaded necklace outdoors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1a182\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-wearing-a-floral-patterned-white-shirt-and-beaded-necklace-outdoors.jpg?id=63527474&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">With over 2,000 hacks to improve usability of assistive technologies, veteran DIY maker Therese Willkomm has earned the moniker \u201cthe MacGyver of assistive tech.\u201d </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Therese Willkomm</small></p><p><strong>What deserves more focus in your field?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> The supply-and-demand problem. It all comes down to time and money. We have an elderly population that continues to grow, and a disability population that continues to grow\u2014high demand, high need for assistive technology, yet the resources available to meet that need are limited. A few years back, the <a href=\"https://www.christopherreeve.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation</a> had a competition. I submitted a proposal similar to the <a href=\"https://topmealkitdelivery.com/compare-top/?utm_source=google&amp;keyword=how%20does%20blue%20apron%20work&amp;campaignid=19738344647&amp;adgroupid=147312616278&amp;targetid=kwd-119910014195&amp;device=c&amp;loc_physical=9001648&amp;net_type=g&amp;mt=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19738344647&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACWvR1todciLbxMtVpO1D33ERjChb&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAssfLBhBDEiwAcLpwfhQhzA6bmvh2gvcKuF296EMnhDCD_JjnPyNwHec6UsC5F7V2brgQGhoCabYQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Apron approach</a>. People don\u2019t have supplies at their house. They can\u2019t buy two inches of tape\u2014they have to buy a whole roll. They can\u2019t buy one foot of corrugated plastic\u2014they\u2019ve got to buy an 18-by-24 sheet or wait till it gets donated.</p><p>With my <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58523017-assistive-technology-solutions-in-minutes-book-iii---make-stuff-and-love\" target=\"_blank\">third book</a>, I created solutions with QR codes showing videos on how to make them. I used Christopher Reeve Foundation funding to purchase supplies. With Blue Apron, somebody wants to make dinner and a box arrives with a chicken breast, potato, vegetables, and recipe. I thought, what if we could apply that to assistive technology? Somebody needs something, there\u2019s a solution out there, but they don\u2019t have the money or the time\u2014how can we quickly put it in a box and send it to them? People who attended my workshops didn\u2019t have to spend money on materials or waste time at the store. They\u2019d watch the video and assemble it.</p><p>But then there were people who said, \u201cI do not have even five minutes in the school day to stop what I\u2019m doing to make something.\u201d So we found volunteers who said, \u201cHey, I can make slant boards. I can make switches. I can adapt toys.\u201d You have people who want to build stuff and people who need stuff. If you can deal with the time and money issue, anything\u2019s possible to serve more people and provide more devices.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s your biggest vision for the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> I\u2019m very passionate about communication. December 15 was the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">passage in 1791 of our First Amendment</a>, freedom of speech. Yet people with communication impairments are denied their basic right of freedom of speech because they don\u2019t have an affordable communication device, or it takes too long to program or learn. I just wish we could get better at designing and fabricating affordable communication devices, so everybody is awarded their First Amendment right. It shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s nice to have\u2014it\u2019s something that\u2019s needed to have. When you lose your leg, you\u2019re fitted with a prosthetic device, and insurance covers that. Insurance should also cover communication devices and all the support services needed. With voice recognition and computer-generated voices, there are tremendous opportunities in assistive technology for communication impairments that need to be addressed.</p><p><strong>What should </strong><em><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></strong></em><strong> readers take away from this conversation?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm: </strong>There\u2019s tremendous need for this skill set\u2014working in conjunction with AI and material sciences and the field of assistive technology and rehab engineering. I\u2019d like people to look at opportunities to volunteer their time and also to pursue careers in the field of specialized rehab engineering.</p><p><strong>How are DIY approaches evolving with new technologies?</strong></p><p><strong>Willkomm:</strong> What we\u2019re seeing at maker fairs is more people doing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printed-rockets-india-agnikul\" target=\"_blank\">3D printing</a>, switch-access controls, and these five-minute approaches. There has to be a healthy balance between what we can do with or without electronics. If we need something programmed with electronics, absolutely\u2014but is there a faster way?</p><p>The other thing that\u2019s interesting is skill development. You used to have to go to college for four, six, eight years. With YouTube, you can learn so much on the internet. You can develop skills in things you never thought were possible without a four-year degree. There\u2019s basic electronic stuff you can absolutely learn without taking a course. I think we\u2019re going to have more people out there doing hacks, asking \u201cWhat if I change it this way?\u201d We don\u2019t need to have a switch. </p><p>We need to look at the person\u2019s body and how that body interacts with the electronic device interface so it requires minimal effort\u2014whether it be eye control or motion control. Having devices that predict what you\u2019re going to want next, that are constantly listening, knowing the way you talk. I love the fact that AI looks at all my emails and creates this whole thing like \u201cHere\u2019s how I\u2019d respond.\u201d I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s exactly it. I just hit select, and I don\u2019t have to type it all out. It speeds up communication.

Superpressure balloons can last for months and travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the while reporting their position.</p><p>You might imagine that an undertaking like this would be immensely difficult and cost thousands of dollars. In fact, you can build and launch such a balloon for about the cost of a fancy dinner out. You just have to think small! That\u2019s why amateur balloonists call them pico balloons.</p><p>The payload of a pico balloon is so light (between 12 to 30 grams) that you can use a large Mylar party balloon filled with helium to lift it. They\u2019re also inexpensive; that\u2019s important because you won\u2019t get your payload back. And because such diminutive payloads don\u2019t pose a danger to aircraft, they aren\u2019t subject to the many rules and restrictions on free-floating balloons that carry more mass.</p><p>The essential advances that made pico ballooning possible were figuring out how to track a balloon no matter where in the world it might be and how to power such tiny payloads. A lot of folks worked on these challenges and came up with good solutions that aren\u2019t hard or expensive to reproduce.</p><h2>What is WSPR?</h2><p>Amazingly, the global tracking of the balloon\u2019s telemetry is done without satellites. Instead, pico balloonists take advantage of an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amateur-radio\" target=\"_blank\">amateur-radio</a> network called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WSPR</a> (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter), a protocol developed by a rather famous ham-radio enthusiast\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hooton_Taylor_Jr.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr</a>., one of the two scientists awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering binary pulsars.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Major components of a pico balloon payload.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"176da\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/major-components-of-a-pico-balloon-payload.png?id=63339919&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller [top left] is soldered directly to a daughterboard consisting of a high-frequency transmitter and a GPS module [bottom left], which are all powered by solar panels [right].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>WSPR was designed to monitor signal-propagation conditions for different radio bands\u2014useful information if you\u2019re a ham trying to make distant contacts. WSPR can also record low-power balloon-telemetry signals. WSPR is very low bandwidth\u2014less than 10 bits per minute\u2014but it does the job. A worldwide network of radio amateurs receives these WSPR signals and reports them publicly over the internet, which gives picoballoonists a way to track their flights. You need at least a <a href=\"https://www.arrl.org/upgrading-to-a-general-license\" target=\"_blank\">general-class</a> ham-radio license to launch a pico balloon, as one is required to transmit on the bands used for long-distance telemetry.</p><p>The pico balloon payload I chose to build is based on the aptly named US $4 <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi Pico board</a>, with a solder-on daughterboard that contains a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gps\" target=\"_blank\">GPS</a> receiver and transmitter. The folks who developed this daughterboard and associated software (to create what they call the <a href=\"https://traquito.github.io/tracker/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack WSPR Tracker</a>) have done a fantastic job of making their work easy to reproduce.</p><p>You could, in principle, power the Jetpack tracker with batteries, but in practice it would be impossible to keep them warm in the stratosphere, where average temperatures can be as low as \u201351 \u00b0C. Instead, the tracker runs off two lightweight solar modules. At night, it gracefully powers down. When the sun rises high enough in the morning, the tracker powers up and starts transmitting again.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>My first pico balloon made it only halfway across the Atlantic before going silent.</span></p><p>I had five Jetpack boards custom-manufactured in China for just $39. The cost nearly doubled after adding shipping and tariff charges. Still that\u2019s really cheap, even when you add the cost of the Raspberry Pi ($4), <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F28ZWPY6\" target=\"_blank\">the party balloon</a> ($10 for two), the helium ($10 at my local supermarket), and the two <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerFilm-MPT6-75-Module-Flexible-Thin-Film/dp/B002MFGD16\" target=\"_blank\">solar modules</a> ($7 each).</p><p>The biggest sticking point I had with the Jetpack design was the liberties it takes with spurious emissions from its transmitter. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations call for spurious emissions to be at least 43 decibels below the power of the transmitted signal. But my transmitter had strong unwanted emissions at odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency. (That\u2019s because the transmitter is a<a href=\"https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/3/e/a/9/a/Si5351-datasheet.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Si5351A</a> temperature-controlled oscillator, which outputs a square wave, not a sinusoid.) Taking measurements, I could see that the third harmonic at 42 megahertz was only 25 dB quieter than the 14-MHz fundamental of my WSPR signal\u2019s frequency. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A map showing a track from North Carolina in the United States across the Atlantic and the Iberean peninsula to the Mediterranean. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"77213\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-map-showing-a-track-from-north-carolina-in-the-united-states-across-the-atlantic-and-the-iberean-peninsula-to-the-mediterranea.png?id=63339932&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">As of press time, the WSPR network had tracked my balloon from the Eastern United States to the Mediterranean coast. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>In practical terms, this shouldn\u2019t create any noticeable interference, given that this transmitter puts out milliwatts at most and floats miles away from the nearest receiver. Still, I wanted to be fully compliant with FCC regulations, so I added traps to the antenna\u2014simple circuit elements that hams use to allow a single antenna to work on multiple bands by altering how the antenna resonates at different frequencies. Each trap was made of a small inductor (four 5-millimeter-diameter loops of No. 32 magnet wire) in parallel with a 220-picofarad capacitor. I tuned them with the help of a <a href=\"https://nanovna.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NanoVNA</a> signal analyzer by stretching the loops apart slightly. I attached the traps directly to the tracker board, so that they quashed the spurious 42-MHz emissions at the source. That worked well and added only 0.3 grams of weight.</p><p>With my payload complete, I partially filled my balloon with helium. You want the balloon to hold just a little more gas than it takes to lift the payload off the ground. This will give the helium room to expand as the balloon climbs to its final altitude.</p><p>My first pico balloon, launched from a park near my home in North Carolina, made it only halfway across the Atlantic before going silent. My second went up and was never heard from again. The third was indeed the charm. It crossed the Iberian Peninsula and at the time of this writing is somewhere over the Mediterranean at an altitude of nearly 12 kilometers. With any luck, <a href=\"https://traquito.github.io/search/spots/dashboard/?band=20m&amp;channel=104&amp;callsign=N4LVD&amp;dtGte=2026-01-01\" target=\"_blank\">it might go on</a> to orbit the planet.</p><p>I\u2019m a little puzzled about the balloons\u2019 telemetry messages received on the WSPR network, as they have been few and far between. My best guess is that power from the horizontal solar panels I\u2019m using is marginal, with the winter sun being so low in the sky. That\u2019s something I should have thought about before launching the first balloon just 24 hours after the winter solstice!</p><p><em>This article appears in the February 2026 print issue as \u201c<span>Long-Duration Amateur Ballooning</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

In a demonstration, the Perseverance team <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-completes-first-ai-planned-drive-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">used AI to generate the rover\u2019s waypoints</a>.

That means that one way or another, rovers are on their own for short periods of time.</p><p>The delay shapes the route-planning process. Rover drivers here on Earth examine images and elevation data and program a series of waypoints, which usually don\u2019t exceed 100 meters apart. The driving plan is sent to <a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/dsn-now/\" target=\"_blank\">NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network</a> (DSN), which transmits it to one of several orbiters, which then relay it to Perseverance. (Perseverance can receive direct comms from the DSN as a back up, but the data rate is slower.)</p><h2>AI Enhances Mars Rover Navigation</h2><p>In this demonstration, the AI model analyzed orbital images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uahirise.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HiRISE camera</a>, as well as digital elevation models. The AI, which is based on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-ai-coding-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic\u2019s Claude AI</a>, identified hazards like sand traps, boulder fields, bedrock, and rocky outcrops. Then it generated a path defined by a series of waypoints that avoids the hazards. From there, Perseverance\u2019s auto-navigation system took over. It has more autonomy than its predecessors and can process images and driving plans while in motion.</p><p>There was another important step before these waypoints were transmitted to Perseverance. NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has a \u201ctwin\u201d for Perseverance called the \u201cVehicle System Test Bed\u201d (VSTB) in JPL\u2019s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/how-we-do-it/facilities/marsyard-iii/\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Yard</a>. It\u2019s an engineering model that the team can work with here on Earth to solve problems, or for situations like this. These engineering versions are common on Mars missions, and JPL has one for Curiosity, too.</p><p>\u201cThe fundamental elements of generative AI are showing a lot of promise in streamlining the pillars of autonomous navigation for off-planet driving: perception (seeing the rocks and ripples), localization (knowing where we are), and planning and control (deciding and executing the safest path),\u201d said Vandi Verma, a space roboticist at JPL and a member of the Perseverance engineering team. \u201cWe are moving towards a day where generative AI and other smart tools will help our surface rovers handle kilometer-scale drives while minimizing operator workload, and flag interesting surface features for our science team by scouring huge volumes of rover images.\u201d</p><h2>AI\u2019s Expanding Role in Space Exploration</h2><p><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\">AI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in our lives</a>, showing up in places that don\u2019t necessarily have a strong use case for it. But this isn\u2019t NASA hopping on the AI bandwagon. They\u2019ve been developing automatic navigation systems for a while, out of necessity. In fact, Perseverance\u2019s primary means of driving is its self-driving autonomous navigation system.</span></p><p>One thing that prevents fully-autonomous driving is the way uncertainty grows as the rover operates without human assistance. The longer the rover travels, the more uncertain it becomes about its position on the surface. The solution is to re-localize the rover on its map. Currently, humans do this. But this takes time, including a complete communication cycle between Earth and Mars. Overall, it limits how far Perseverance can go without a helping hand.</p><p>NASA/JPL is also working on a way that Perseverance can <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/media/documents/2024_Global_Localization_ICRA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">use AI to re-localize</a>. The main roadblock is matching orbital images with the rover\u2019s ground-level images. It seems highly likely that AI will be trained to excel at this.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious that AI is set to play a much larger role in planetary exploration. The next Mars rover may be much different than current ones, with more advanced autonomous navigation and other AI features. There are already concepts for a swarm of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mars-helicopter-ingenuity-end-mission\" target=\"_blank\">flying drones released by a rover</a> to expand its explorative reach on Mars. These swarms would be controlled by AI to work together and autonomously.</p><p>And it\u2019s not just Mars exploration that will benefit from AI. NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(Titan_space_probe)\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonfly</a> mission to Saturn\u2019s moon Titan will make extensive use of AI. Not only for autonomous navigation as the rotorcraft flies around, but also for autonomous data curation.</p><p>\u201cImagine intelligent systems not only on the ground at Earth, but also in edge applications in our rovers, helicopters, drones, and other surface elements trained with the collective wisdom of our NASA engineers, scientists, and astronauts,\u201d said Matt Wallace, manager of JPL\u2019s Exploration Systems Office. \u201cThat is the game-changing technology we need to establish the infrastructure and systems required for a permanent human presence on the Moon and take the U.S. to Mars and beyond.\u201d</p>"

With demand expanding beyond fully autonomous vehicles into driver-assistance applications, \u201cone order or even two orders of magnitude reduction in cost are feasible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are focused on delivering automotive-grade lidar that can actually be deployed at scale,\u201d says MicroVision CEO <a href=\"https://ir.microvision.com/news/press-releases/detail/430/microvision-appoints-glen-devos-as-chief-executive-officer\" target=\"_blank\">Glen DeVos</a>. \u201cThat means designing for cost, manufacturability, and integration from the start\u2014not treating price as an afterthought.\u201d</p><h2>MicroVision\u2019s Lidar System</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> CEO <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk</a> famously dismissed lidar in 2019 as \u201c<a href=\"https://professional.mit.edu/news/articles/lidar-fools-errand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a fool\u2019s errand</a>,\u201d arguing that cameras and radar alone were sufficient for automated driving. A credible path to sub-$200 pricing would fundamentally alter the calculus of autonomous-car design by lowering the cost of adding precise three-dimensional sensing to mainstream vehicles. The shift reflects a broader industry trend toward solid-state lidar designs optimized for low-cost, high-volume manufacturing rather than maximum range or resolution.</p><p>Before those economics can be evaluated, however, it\u2019s important to understand what MicroVision is proposing to build.</p><p>The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://microvision.com/sensors/movia-s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Movia S</a> is a solid-state lidar. Mounted at the corners of a vehicle, the sensor sends out 905-nanometer-wavelength laser pulses and measures how long it takes for light reflected from the surfaces of nearby objects to return. The arrangement of the beam emitters and receivers provides a fixed field of view designed for 180-degree horizontal coverage rather than full 360-degree scanning typical of traditional mechanical units. The company says the unit can detect objects at distances of up to roughly 200 meters under favorable weather conditions\u2014compared with the roughly 300-meter radius scanned by mechanical systems\u2014and supports frame rates suitable for real-time perception in driver-assistance systems. Earlier mechanical lidars, used spinning components to steer their beams but the Movia S is a phased-arraysystem. It controls the amplitude and phase of the signals across an array of antenna elements to steer the beam. The unit is designed to meet automotive requirements for vibration tolerance, temperature range, and environmental sealing.</p><p>MicroVision\u2019s pricing targets might sound aggressive, but they are not without precedent. The lidar industry has already experienced one major cost reset over the past decade.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cAutomakers are not buying a single sensor in isolation... They are designing a perception system, and cost only matters if the system as a whole is viable.\u201d <strong>\u2013Glen DeVos, MicroVision</strong></p><p>Around 2016 and 2017, mechanical lidar systems used in early autonomous driving research often sold for close to $100,000. Those units relied on spinning assemblies to sweep laser beams across a full 360 degrees, which made them expensive to build and difficult to ruggedize for consumer vehicles.</p><p>\u201cBack then, a 64-beam <a href=\"https://investors.ouster.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ouster-and-velodyne-complete-merger-equals-accelerate-lidar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Velodyne</a> lidar cost around $80,000,\u201d says Radha.</p><p>Comparable mechanical lidars from multiple suppliers now sell in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. That roughly tenfold drop helps explain why suppliers now believe another steep price reduction is possible. </p><p>\u201cFor solid-state devices, it is feasible to bring the cost down even more when manufacturing at high volume,\u201d Radha says. With demand expanding beyond fully <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-vehicles\" target=\"_self\">autonomous vehicles</a> into driver-assistance applications, \u201cone order or even two orders of magnitude reduction in cost are feasible.\u201d</p><h2>Solid-State Lidar Design Challenges</h2><p>Lower cost, however, does not come for free. The same design choices that enable solid-state lidar to scale also introduce new constraints.</p><p>\u201cUnlike mechanical lidars, which provide full 360-degree coverage, solid-state lidars tend to have a much smaller field of view,\u201d Radha says. Many cover 180 degrees or less.</p><p>That limitation shifts the burden from the sensor to the system. Automakers will need to deploy three or four solid-state lidars around a vehicle to achieve full coverage. Even so, Radha notes, the total cost can still undercut that of a single mechanical unit.</p><p>What changes is integration. Multiple sensors must be aligned, calibrated, and synchronized so their data can be fused accurately. The engineering is manageable, but it adds complexity that price targets alone do not capture.</p><p>DeVos says MicroVision\u2019s design choices reflect that reality. \u201cAutomakers are not buying a single sensor in isolation,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are designing a perception system, and cost only matters if the system as a whole is viable.\u201d</p><p>Those system-level tradeoffs help explain where low-cost lidar is most likely to appear first.</p><p>Most advanced driver assistance systems today rely on cameras and radar, which are significantly cheaper than lidar. Cameras provide dense visual information, while radar offers reliable range and velocity data, particularly in poor weather. Radha estimates that lidar remains roughly an order of magnitude more expensive than automotive radar.</p><p>But at prices in the $100 to $200 range, that gap narrows enough to change design decisions.</p><p>\u201cAt that point, lidar becomes appealing because of its superior capability in precise 3D detection and tracking,\u201d Radha says.</p><p>Rather than replacing existing sensors, lower-cost lidar would likely augment them, adding redundancy and improving performance in complex environments that are challenging for electronic perception systems. That incremental improvement aligns more closely with how ADAS features are deployed today than with the leap to full vehicle autonomy.</p><p>MicroVision is not alone in pursuing solid-state lidar, and several suppliers including Chinese firms Hesai and RoboSense and other major suppliers such as Luminar and Velodyne have announced long-term cost targets below $500. What distinguishes current claims is the explicit focus on sub-$200 pricing tied to production volume rather than future prototypes or limited pilot runs.</p><p>Some competitors continue to prioritize long-range performance for autonomous vehicles, which pushes cost upward. Others have avoided aggressive pricing claims until they secure firm production commitments from automakers.</p><p>That caution reflects a structural challenge: Reaching consumer-level pricing requires large, predictable demand. Without it, few suppliers can justify the manufacturing investments needed to achieve true economies of scale.</p><h2>Evaluating Lidar Performance Metrics</h2><h2></h2><p>Even if low-cost lidar becomes manufacturable, another question remains: How should its performance be judged?</p><p>From a systems-engineering perspective, Radha says cost milestones often overshadow safety metrics.</p><p>\u201cThe key objective of ADAS and autonomous systems is improving safety,\u201d he says. Yet there is no universally adopted metric that directly expresses safety gains from a given sensor configuration.</p><p>Researchers instead rely on perception benchmarks such as <a href=\"https://www.v7labs.com/blog/mean-average-precision\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mean Average Precision</a>, or mAP, which measures how accurately a system detects and tracks objects in its environment. Including such metrics alongside cost targets, says Radha, would clarify what performance is preserved or sacrificed as prices fall.</p><p><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> has covered lidar extensively, often focusing on technical advances in scanning, range, and resolution. What distinguishes the current moment is the renewed focus on economics rather than raw capability</p><p>If solid-state lidar can reliably reach sub-$200 pricing, it will not invalidate Elon Musk\u2019s skepticism\u2014but it will weaken one of its strongest foundations. When cost stops being the dominant objection, automakers will have to decide whether leaving lidar out is a technical judgment or a strategic one.</p><p>That decision, more than any single price claim, may determine whether lidar finally becomes a routine component of vehicle safety systems.</p>"

Launched in 2006 as a collaboration between <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a>, and the <a href=\"https://nysci.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New York Hall of Science</a> (NYSCI), TryEngineering began with a clear goal: Make engineering accessible, understandable, and engaging for students and the teachers who support them.</p><p>What started as an idea within <a href=\"https://ea.ieee.org/ea-programs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities</a> has grown into a global platform supporting preuniversity engineering education around the world.</p><h2>Concerns about the future</h2><p>In the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.nae.edu/19579/19582/21020/16145/16161/The-Status-and-Nature-of-K12-Engineering-Education-in-the-United-States\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">engineering was largely absent from preuniversity education</a>, typically being taught only in small, isolated programs. Most students had little exposure to the many types of engineering, and they did not learn what engineers actually do.</p><p>At the same time, industry and academic leaders were increasingly concerned about the future of engineering as a whole. They worried about the talent pipeline and saw existing outreach efforts as scattered and inconsistent.</p><p>In 2004 representatives from several electrical and computer engineering industries met with IEEE leadership and expressed their concerns about the declining number of students interested in engineering careers. They urged IEEE to organize a more effective, coordinated response to unite professional societies, educators, and industry around a shared approach to preuniversity outreach and education.</p><p>One of the major recommendations to come out of that meeting was to start teaching youngsters about engineering earlier. <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/publications/10573\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> from the U.S. National Academy of Engineering at the time showed that students begin forming attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and math fields from ages 5 to 10, and that outreach should begin as early as kindergarten. Waiting until the teen years or university-level education is simply too late, they determined; it needs to happen during the formative years to spark long-term interest in STEM learning.</p><h2>The idea behind the website</h2><p>TryEngineering emerged from the broader <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4760339\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Launching Our Children\u2019s Path to Engineering</a> initiative, which was approved in 2005 by the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/board\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Board of Directors</a>. A core element of the IEEE program was a public-facing website that would introduce young learners to engineering projects, roles, and careers. The concept eventually developed into TryEngineering.org.</p><p>The idea for TryEngineering.org itself grew from an existing, successful model. The NYSCI operated <a href=\"https://tryscience.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TryScience.org</a>, a popular public website supported by <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a> that helped students explore science topics through hands-on activities and real\u2011world connections.</p><p>At the time, the IEEE Educational Activities group was working with the NYSCI on TryScience projects. Building a parallel site focused on engineering was a natural next step, and IBM\u2019s experience in supporting large\u2011scale educational outreach made it a strong partner.</p><p>A central figure in turning that vision into reality was <a href=\"https://www.moshekam.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moshe Kam</a>, who served as the 2005\u20132007 IEEE Educational Activities vice president, and later as the 2011 IEEE president. During his tenure, Kam spearheaded the creation of TryEngineering.org and guided the international expansion of IEEE\u2019s Teacher In\u2011Service Program, which trained volunteers to work directly with teachers to create hands-on engineering lessons (the program no longer exists). His leadership helped establish preuniversity education as a core, long\u2011term priority within IEEE.</p><p>\u201cThe founders of the IEEE TryEngineering program created something very special. In a world where the messaging about becoming an engineer often scares students who have not yet developed math skills away from our profession, and preuniversity teachers without engineering degrees have trepidation in teaching topics in our fields of interest, people like Dr. Kam and the other founders had a vision where everyone could literally <em><em>try</em></em> engineering,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-moesch-7502b31/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Moesch</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ieee-educational-activities\" target=\"_self\">IEEE Educational Activities</a> managing director.</p><p> \u201cBecause of this, teachers have now taught millions of our hands-on lessons and opened our profession to so many more young minds,\u201d he adds. \u201cAll of the preuniversity programs we have continued to build and improve upon are fueled by this massively important and simple-to-understand concept of try engineering.\u201d</p><h2>A focus on educators</h2><p>From the beginning, TryEngineering focused on educators as the keys to its success, rather than starting with students. Instead of complex technical explanations, the platform offered free, classroom-ready lesson plans with clear explanations about engineering fields and examples with which students could relate. Hands-on activities emphasized problem\u2011solving, creativity, and teamwork\u2014core elements of how engineers actually work.</p><p>IEEE leaders also recognized that misconceptions about engineering discouraged many talented young people\u2014particularly girls and students from underrepresented groups\u2014from pursuing engineering as a career. TryEngineering aimed to show engineering as practical, creative, and connected to real-world needs, helping students see that engineering could be for anyone, not just a narrow group of specialists.</p><p>By simply encouraging students and educators to just <em><em>try</em></em> engineering, doors are open to new possibilities and a broader understanding of the field. Even students who ultimately choose other career paths get to learn key concepts, such as the <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/news/engineering-design-process/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">engineering design process</a>, equipping them with practical skills for the rest of their life.</p><h2>Outreach programs and summer camps</h2><p>During the past two decades, TryEngineering has grown well beyond its original website. In addition to providing a <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/explore-resources/lesson-plans/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vast library of lesson plans and resources</a> that engage and inspire, it also serves as the hub for a collection of programs reaching educators and students in many ways.</p><p>Those include the <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/get-involved/ieee-members/stem-champions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TryEngineering STEM Champions</a> program, which empowers dedicated volunteers to support outreach programs and serve as vital connectors to IEEE\u2019s extensive resources. The <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-tryengineering-summer-camp\" target=\"_self\">TryEngineering Summer Institute</a> offers immersive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-tryengineering-summer-camp\" target=\"_self\">campus\u2011based experiences</a> for students ages 13 to 17, with expanded locations and programs being introduced this year.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-stem-summit-2025\" target=\"_self\">IEEE STEM Summit</a> is an annual virtual event that brings together <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-stem-summit-2025\" target=\"_self\">educators and volunteers from around the world</a>. <a href=\"https://oncampus.tryengineering.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TryEngineering OnCampus</a> partners with universities around the globe to organize hands-on programs. <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/news/50-teachers-in-5-states-learn-about-semiconductors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TryEngineering educator sessions</a> provide free professional development programs aligned with emerging industry needs such as semiconductors.</p><h2>20 ways to celebrate 20 years</h2><p>To mark its 20th anniversary, TryEngineering is celebrating with a year of special activities, new partnerships, and fresh resources for educators.
