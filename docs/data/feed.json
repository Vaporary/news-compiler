These refer to specific computing approaches. A recent term sounds more mundane but has revolutionary implications: <em><em>timeline</em></em>. Ask someone in AI for their timeline, and they\u2019ll tell you when they expect the arrival of AGI\u2014artificial general intelligence\u2014which is sometimes defined as AI technology that can match the abilities of humans at most tasks. As AI\u2019s sophistication has scaled\u2014thanks to faster computers, better algorithms, and more data\u2014timelines have compressed. The leaders of major AI labs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind, have recently said they expect AGI within a few years.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>A computer system that thinks like us would enable close collaboration. Both the immediate and long-term impacts of AGI, if achieved, are unclear, but expect to see changes in the economy, scientific discovery, and geopolitics. And if AGI leads to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/can-we-stop-the-singularity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">superintelligence</a>, it may even affect humanity\u2019s placement in the predatory pecking order. So it\u2019s imperative that we track the technology\u2019s progress in preparation for such disruption. Benchmarking AI\u2019s capabilities allows us to shape legal regulations, engineering goals, social norms, and business models\u2014and to understand intelligence more broadly.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/computers-ace-iq-tests-still-make-dumb-mistakes-can-different-tests-help\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarking</a> any intellectual ability is tough, doing so for AGI presents special challenges. That\u2019s in part because people strongly disagree on its definition: Some define AGI by its performance on benchmarks, others by its internal workings, its economic impact, or vibes. So the first step toward measuring the intelligence of AI is agreeing on the general concept.</p><h3></h3><br /><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/arc-prize-agi-test\" target=\"_blank\">Are You Smarter Than an AI?</a></h2><p>Play a version of the game that researchers are using to track AI\u2019s progress toward artificial general intelligence.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Another issue is that AI systems have different strengths and weaknesses from humans, so even if we define AGI as \u201cAI that can match humans at most tasks,\u201d we can debate which tasks really count, and which humans set the standard. Direct comparisons are difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re building alien beings,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/hinton/facts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">won a Nobel Prize</a> for his work on AI.</p><p>Undaunted researchers are busy designing and proposing tests that might lend some insight into our future. But a question remains: Can these tests tell us if we\u2019ve achieved the long-sought goal of AGI?</p><h2>Why It\u2019s So Hard to Test for Intelligence</h2><p>There are infinite kinds of intelligence, even in humans. IQ tests provide a kind of summary statistic by including a range of semirelated tasks involving memory, logic, spatial processing, mathematics, and vocabulary. Sliced differently, performance on each task relies on a mixture of what\u2019s called <em>fluid</em> intelligence\u2014reasoning on the fly\u2014and <em>crystallized</em> intelligence\u2014applying learned knowledge or skills.</p><p>For humans in high-income countries, IQ tests often predict key outcomes, such as academic and career success. But we can\u2019t make the same assumptions about AI, whose abilities aren\u2019t bundled in the same way. An IQ test designed for humans might not say the same thing about a machine as it does about a person.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>There are other kinds of intelligence that aren\u2019t usually evaluated by IQ tests\u2014and are even further out of reach for most AI benchmarks. These include types of social intelligence, such as the ability to make psychological inferences, and types of physical intelligence, such as an understanding of causal relations between objects and forces or the ability to coordinate a body in an environment. Both are crucial for humans navigating complex situations.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"An old black-and-white photograph shows a man in a long coat standing next to a horse.

You must beware of both false positives and false negatives. Maybe the test taker appears smart only by taking shortcuts, like <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Clever-Hans\" target=\"_blank\">Clever Hans</a>, the famous horse that appeared to be capable of math but actually responded to nonverbal cues. Or maybe test takers appear stupid only because they are unfamiliar with the testing procedure or have perceptual difficulties.</p><p>It\u2019s also hard because notions of intelligence vary across place and time. \u201cThere is an interesting shift in our society in terms of what we think intelligence is and what aspects of it are valuable,\u201d says <a href=\"https://anna-ivanova.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Ivanova</a>, an assistant professor of psychology at Georgia Tech. For example, before encyclopedias and the Internet, \u201chaving a large access to facts in your head was considered a hallmark of intelligence.\u201d Now we increasingly prize fluid over crystallized intelligence.</p><h2>The History of AI Intelligence Tests</h2><p>Over the years, many people have presented machines with grand challenges that purported to require intelligence on par with our own. In 1958, a trio of prominent AI researchers <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5392645\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>, \u201cChess is the intellectual game <em><em>par excellence.</em></em>\u2026 If one could devise a successful chess machine, one would seem to have penetrated to the core of human intellectual endeavor.\u201d They did acknowledge the theoretical possibility that such a machine \u201cmight have discovered something that was as the wheel to the human leg: a device quite different from humans in its methods, but supremely effective in its way, and perhaps very simple.\u201d But they stood their ground: \u201cThere appears to be nothing of this sort in sight.\u201d In 1997, something of this sort was very much in sight when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\" target=\"_blank\">beat Garry Kasparov</a>, the reigning chess champion, while lacking the general intelligence even to play checkers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man leans over a chess board on a desk, studying the pieces.

For decades, passing what\u2019s now called the Turing test was considered a nearly impossible challenge and a strong indicator of AGI.</p><p>But this year, researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that when people conversed with both another person and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for 5 minutes and then had to guess which one was human, they picked the AI 73 percent of the time. Meanwhile, top language models frequently make mistakes that few people ever would, like miscounting the number of times the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@anthonyokeh/llms-worst-nightmare-the-strawberry-problem-af0b95ff05c2\" target=\"_blank\">letter<em><em> r</em></em> occurs in<em><em> strawberry</em></em></a>. They appear to be more wheel than human leg. So scientists are still searching for measures of humanlike intelligence that can\u2019t be hacked.</p><h2>The ARC Test for AGI</h2><p>There\u2019s one AGI benchmark that, while not perfect, has gained a high profile as a foil for most new frontier models. In 2019, <a href=\"https://fchollet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fran\u00e7ois Chollet</a>, then a software engineer at Google and now a founder of the AI startup <a href=\"https://ndea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ndea</a>, released a paper titled \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547\" target=\"_blank\">On the Measure of Intelligence</a>.\u201d Many people equate intelligence to ability, and general intelligence to a broad set of abilities. Chollet takes a narrower view of intelligence, counting only one specific ability as important\u2014the ability to acquire new abilities easily. Large language models (LLMs) like those powering ChatGPT do well on many benchmarks only after training on trillions of written words. When LLMs encounter a situation very unlike their training data, they frequently flop, unable to adjust. In Chollet\u2019s sense, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-do-you-test-the-iq-of-ai\" target=\"_self\">they lack intelligence</a>.</p><p>To go along with the paper, Chollet created a new AGI benchmark, called the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (<a href=\"https://arcprize.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ARC</a>). It features hundreds of visual puzzles, each with several demonstrations and one test. A demonstration has an input grid and an output grid, both filled with colored squares. The test has just an input grid. The challenge is to learn a rule from the demonstrations and apply it in the test, creating a new output grid.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two examples show small colorful shapes on black grids labeled \\u201cinput\\u201d and, on grids labeled \\u201coutput,\\u201d those same shapes at a larger scale and now interlocking. The test shows another input grid with small shapes, and a blank output grid.     \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"14ef1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-examples-show-small-colorful-shapes-on-black-grids-labeled-u201cinput-u201d-and-on-grids-labeled-u201coutput-u201d-those.png?id=61614421&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus challenges AI systems to infer abstract rules from just a few examples. Given examples of input-output grids, the system must apply the hidden pattern to a new test case\u2014something humans find easy but machines still struggle with. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>ARC focuses on fluid intelligence. \u201cTo solve any problem, you need some knowledge, and then you\u2019re going to recombine that knowledge on the fly,\u201d Chollet told me. To make it a test not of stored knowledge but of how one recombines it, the training puzzles are supposed to supply all the \u201ccore knowledge priors\u201d one needs. These include concepts like object cohesion, symmetry, and counting\u2014the kind of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-computers-learn-common-sense\" target=\"_blank\">common sense</a> a small child has. Given this training and just a few examples, can you figure out which knowledge to apply to a new puzzle? Humans can do most of the puzzles easily, but AI struggled, at least at first. Eventually, OpenAI created a version of its o3 reasoning model that <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough\" target=\"_blank\">outperformed the average human test taker</a>, achieving a score of 88 percent\u2014albeit at an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11831\" target=\"_blank\">estimated computing cost</a> of US $20,000 per puzzle. (OpenAI never released that model, so it\u2019s not on the leaderboard chart.)</p><p>This March, Chollet introduced a harder version, called <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/announcing-arc-agi-2-and-arc-prize-2025\" target=\"_blank\">ARC-AGI-2</a>. It\u2019s overseen by his new nonprofit, the ARC Prize Foundation. \u201cOur mission is to serve as a North Star towards AGI through enduring benchmarks,\u201d the group announced. ARC Prize is offering a million dollars in prize money, the bulk going to teams whose trained AIs can solve 85 percent of 120 new puzzles using only four graphics processors for 12 hours or less. The new puzzles are more complex than those from 2019, sometimes requiring the application of multiple rules, reasoning for multiple steps, or interpreting symbols. The average human score is 60 percent, and as of this writing the <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\">best AI score</a> is about 16 percent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two charts show different AI models\\u2019 performance on the ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 tests, with the score on the x axis and the cost per task on the y axis.\\u00a0\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"958cd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-charts-show-different-ai-models-u2019-performance-on-the-arc-agi-1-and-arc-agi-2-tests-with-the-score-on-the-x-axis-and-the.png?id=61618135&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">AI models have made gradual progress on the first version of the ARC-AGI benchmark, which was introduced in 2019. This year, the ARC Prize launched a new version with harder puzzles, which AI models are struggling with. Models are labeled low, medium, high, or thinking to indicate how much computing power they expend on their answers, with \u201cthinking\u201d models using the most.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>AI experts acknowledge ARC\u2019s value, and also its flaws. <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/\" target=\"_blank\">Jiaxuan You</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says ARC is \u201ca very good theoretical benchmark\u201d that can shed light on how algorithms function, but \u201cit\u2019s not taking into account the real-world complexity of AI applications, such as social reasoning tasks.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://melaniemitchell.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Melanie Mitchell</a>, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute, says it \u201ccaptures some interesting capabilities that humans have,\u201d such as the ability to abstract a new rule from a few examples. But given the narrow task format, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it captures what people mean when they say general intelligence.\u201d</p><p>Despite these caveats, ARC-AGI-2 may be the AI benchmark with the biggest performance gap between advanced AI and regular people, making it a potent indicator of AGI\u2019s headway. What\u2019s more, ARC is a work in progress. Chollet says AI might match human performance on the current test in a year or two, and he\u2019s already working on ARC-AGI-3. Each task will be like a miniature video game, in which the player needs to figure out the relevant concepts, the possible actions, and the goal.</p><h2>What Attributes Should an AGI Benchmark Test?</h2><p>Researchers keep rolling out benchmarks that probe different aspects of general intelligence. Yet each also reveals how incomplete our map of the territory remains.</p><p>One recent paper introduced <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=VsJ1K2HV3k\" target=\"_blank\">General-Bench</a>, a benchmark that uses five input modalities\u2014text, images, video, audio, 3D\u2014to test AI systems on hundreds of tasks that demand recognition, reasoning, creativity, ethical judgment, and other abilities to both comprehend and generate material. Ideally, an AGI would show synergy, leveraging abilities across tasks to outperform the best AI specialists. But at present, no AI can even handle all five modalities.</p><p>Other benchmarks involve virtual worlds. An April paper in <em><em>Nature</em></em> reports on <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08744-2\" target=\"_blank\">Dreamer</a>, a general algorithm from Google DeepMind that learned to perform over 150 tasks, including playing Atari games, controlling virtual robots, and obtaining diamonds in <em><em>Minecraft</em></em>. These tasks require perception, exploration, long-term planning, and interaction, but it\u2019s unclear how well Dreamer would handle real-world messiness. Controlling a video game is easier than controlling a real robot, says <a href=\"https://danijar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danijar Hafner</a>, the paper\u2019s lead author: \u201cThe character never falls on his face.\u201d The tasks also lack rich interaction with humans and an understanding of language in the context of gestures and surroundings. \u201cYou should be able to tell your household robot, \u2018Put the dishes into that cabinet and not over there,\u2019 and you point at [the cabinet] and it understands,\u201d he says. Hafner says his team is working to make the simulations and tasks more realistic.</p><p>Aside from these extant benchmarks, experts have long debated what an ideal demonstration would look like. Back in 1970, the AI pioneer Marvin Minsky <a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/robot/1970-darrach.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em><em>Life</em></em> that in \u201cthree to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being. I mean a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight.\u201d That panel of tasks seems like a decent start, if you could operationalize the game of office politics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby.</p><p>One 2024 paper in <em><em>Engineering</em></em> proposed the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209580992300293X\" target=\"_blank\">Tong test</a> (<em><em>tong</em></em> is Chinese for \u201cgeneral\u201d). Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby, giving researchers the opportunity to observe what the AIs do. The authors argue that benchmarks should test an AI\u2019s ability to explore and set its own goals, its alignment with human values, its causal understanding, and its ability to control a virtual or physical body. What\u2019s more, the benchmark should be capable of generating an infinite number of tasks involving dynamic physical and social interactions.</p><p>Others, like Minsky, have suggested tests that require interacting with the real world to various degrees: making coffee in an unfamiliar kitchen, turning a hundred thousand dollars into a million, or attending college on campus and earning a degree. Unfortunately, some of these tests are impractical and risk causing real-world harm. For example, an AI might earn its million by scamming people.</p><p>I asked Hinton, the Nobel Prize winner, what skills will be the hardest for AI to acquire. \u201cI used to think it was things like figuring out what other people are thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s already doing some of that. It\u2019s already able to do deception.\u201d (In a recent multi-university <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, an LLM outperformed humans at persuading test takers to select wrong answers.) He went on: \u201cSo, right now my answer is plumbing. Plumbing in an old house requires reaching into funny crevices and screwing things the right way. And I think that\u2019s probably safe for another 10 years.\u201d</p><p>Researchers debate whether the ability to perform physical tasks is required to demonstrate AGI. A paper from Google DeepMind on measuring <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=0ofzEysK2D\" target=\"_blank\">levels of AGI</a> says no, arguing that intelligence can show itself in software alone. They frame physical ability as an add-on rather than a requirement for AGI.</p><p>Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute says we should test capabilities involved in doing an entire job. She noted that AI can do many tasks of a human radiologist but can\u2019t replace the human because the job entails a lot of tasks that even the radiologist doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re doing, like figuring out what tasks to do and dealing with unexpected problems. \u201cThere\u2019s such a long tail of things that can happen in the world,\u201d she says. Some robotic vacuum cleaners weren\u2019t trained to recognize dog poop, she notes, and so they smeared it around the carpet. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of stuff like that that you don\u2019t think of when you\u2019re building an intelligent system.\u201d</p><p>Some scientists say we should observe not only performance but what\u2019s happening under the hood. A recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11581\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> coauthored by <a href=\"http://jeffclune.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Clune</a>, a computer scientist at the University of British Columbia, in Canada, reports that deep learning often leads AI systems to create \u201cfractured entangled representations\u201d\u2014basically a bunch of jury-rigged shortcuts wired together. Humans, though, look for broad, elegant regularities in the world. An AI system might appear intelligent based on one test, but if you don\u2019t know the system\u2019s innards, you could be surprised when you deploy it in a new situation and it applies the wrong rule.</p><h2>AGI Is Already Here, and Never Will Be</h2><p>The author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Carroll</a> once wrote of a character who used a map of the nation \u201con the scale of a mile to the mile!\u201d before eventually using the country as its own map. In the case of intelligence testing, the most thorough map of how someone will perform in a situation is to test them in the situation itself. In that vein, a strong test of AGI might be to have a robot live a full human life and, say, raise a child to adulthood.</p><p>\u201cUltimately, the real test of the capabilities of AI is what they do in the real world,\u201d Clune told me. \u201cSo rather than benchmarks, I prefer to look at which scientific discoveries [AIs] make, and which jobs they automate. If people are hiring them to do work instead of a human and sticking with that decision, that\u2019s extremely telling about the capabilities of AI.\u201d But sometimes you want to know how well something will do <em><em>before</em></em> asking it to replace a person.</p><p>We may never agree on what AGI or \u201chumanlike\u201d AI means, or what suffices to prove it. As AI advances, machines will still make mistakes, and people will point to these and say the AIs aren\u2019t really intelligent. Ivanova, the psychologist at Georgia Tech, was on a panel recently, and the moderator asked about AGI timelines. \u201cWe had one person saying that it might never happen,\u201d Ivanova told me, \u201cand one person saying that it already happened.\u201d So the term \u201cAGI\u201d may be convenient shorthand to express an aim\u2014or a fear\u2014but its practical use may be limited. In most cases, it should come with an asterisk, and a benchmark. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cCan We Build a Better IQ Test for AI?\u201d</em></p>"

Her father, a furniture store owner, and her mother, an artisan, instilled in her a love for learning and allowed her the freedom to dream big.</p><p>In 2012 she enrolled at <a href=\"https://www.unibh.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centro Universit\u00e1rio de Belo Horizonte</a> (UniBH) to study civil engineering. Delci chose what she calls a \u201csandwich bachelor\u2019s program\u201d\u2014an arrangement in which students begin their studies at their chosen local university, complete part of their coursework at a university abroad, and then return to their home institution to finish the degree.</p><p>In 2014 she was awarded a full scholarship by Brazil\u2019s federal <a href=\"https://estudonoexterior.com/science-without-borders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Without Borders</a> grant program. It covered tuition, housing, health insurance, learning materials, and airfare.</p><p>\u201cI believed that international academic experience would broaden my perspective and greatly enhance my education,\u201d Delci says. <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">But, she adds, she had to learn a new language to continue her studies.</a> First she took intensive English courses at <a href=\"https://ejf.hu/en/welcome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">E\u00f6tv\u00f6s J\u00f3zsef College</a>, in Baja, Hungary. She then completed two semesters of civil engineering courses, taught in English, at the <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>. From May to July 2015, she interned at <a href=\"https://www.vizmuvek.hu/en/home/aboutourcompany/company-information\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest Waterworks</a>, a city utility. She worked in the three main departments of the company: engineering, project management, and water treatment.</p><p>Delci returned to UniBH in the second semester of 2015 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2017. That same year, she earned a technical diploma in civil construction process operations from the <a href=\"https://www.fiemg.com.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federa\u00e7\u00e3o das Ind\u00fastrias do Estado de Minas Gerais</a>, a regional industry association based in Belo Horizonte.

In 2012, during her first stint at UniBH, she was an intern at <a href=\"https://www.delphiautoparts.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delphi</a> Automotive Systems do Brasil, in Itabirito, Minas Gerais. The role gave her hands-on experience in infrastructure maintenance of the industrial plant, including preparing purchase requisitions and work orders, as well as monitoring modifications in the plant layout, she says.</p><p>She joined Salum Constru\u00e7\u00f5es in 2020 as a trainee engineer<strong>. </strong>She worked on the remediation of waste rock piles at the <a href=\"https://vale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vale</a> <a href=\"https://www.gem.wiki/Vale_Vargem_Grande_Complex_Mine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vargem Grande complex</a> in Minas Gerais, part of Brazil\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://ief.mg.gov.br/w/floor-of-riches-the-iron-quadrangle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Quadrangle</a>.\u201d The site is one of many owned by Vale, the world\u2019s leading producer of iron ore.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to keep working on sustainable solutions, mentoring young engineers, and influencing policy to make the industry more environmentally responsible.\u201d</p><p>The initiative was part of Vale\u2019s broader efforts to minimize reliance on tailings dams\u2014earthen structures built to contain waste byproducts of ore processing\u2014 particularly after Brazil\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/09/world/americas/brazil-dam-collapse.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Brumadinho dam disaster</a> in 2019.

Among the methods she and her team tried was dry stacking, whereby fine, pulverized rock is filtered from tailings and deposited in piles rather than left in the form of sludge.</p><p>\u201cFurther studies and environmental licensing are still needed for large-scale implementation\u201d of dry stacking, she says.</p><p>Today, she\u2019s a civil engineer at Salum. As part of its corporate engineering team, she oversees several large-scale projects.</p><p>She uses cutting-edge technology including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://catenda.com/glossary/4d-bim-building-information-modeling-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4D building information modeling</a>. BIM, a digital construction planning method, uses <a href=\"https://www.gp-radar.com/3d-laser-scanning/bim-modeling\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3D modeling</a> to link each building component\u2014including earthworks, drainage systems and pavement layers\u2014with the construction schedule, with time being the fourth dimension. Such modeling makes the entire project more predictable by allowing teams to anticipate and mitigate risks before they impact the schedule. Her work also focuses on construction principles borrowed from<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/its-not-easy-being-lean\" target=\"_self\"> lean manufacturing</a> that emphasize reducing waste.</p><p>Her approach and knowledge have drawn the attention of her Salum peers and the construction industry at large, she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about digital engineering and how it can help reduce costs, save time, and improve safety,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about getting the work done. It\u2019s about doing it smarter and more sustainably.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s also helping to reshape a traditionally male-dominated field.</p><p>\u201cHeavy civil construction didn\u2019t intimidate me; it motivated me,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to show that engineering talent has no gender. There\u2019s space for women to lead here, and we\u2019re claiming it.\u201d</p><p>Her <a href=\"https://sevenpublicacoes.com.br/RCS/article/view/6635\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> has been published in <a href=\"https://sevenpublicacoes.com.br/RCS/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Revista Cientifica</em></em> <em><em>Sistem\u00e1tica</em></em></a>, the<a href=\"https://ojs.brazilianjournals.com.br/ojs/index.php/BRJD/index\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Brazilian Journal of Development</em></em></a>, and other journals. She has received recognition for leading initiatives that use digital technology to improve large-scale construction. A key indicator of this recognition is the widespread citation of her research by experts. For instance, her articles \u2018Digital Monitoring of Heavy Equipment...\u2019 and \u2018The Effectiveness of Last Planner System...\u2019 have been cited 66 and 56 times, respectively, according to Google Scholar. In academia, this level of citation is an exceptionally high honor, demonstrating that her work is a foundational and influential contribution to the advancement of knowledge in her field.</p><h2>The IEEE advantage</h2><p>Delci heard about IEEE through colleagues who praised its global network of members and technical resources. She joined, she says, to expand her knowledge, collaborate with innovators, and stay ahead of technological trends.</p><p>Today she serves as a volunteer reviewer for several IEEE technical committees and senior member applications, giving back to the organization that helped elevate her career.</p><p>\u201cIEEE showed me that engineering isn\u2019t just local\u2014it\u2019s global,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a community of people who believe in building something better, together.\u201d</p><h2>A focus on sustainable solutions </h2><p>Asked about her long-term goals, Moreira doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI want to keep working on sustainable solutions, mentoring young engineers, and influencing policy,\u201d she says, \u201cto make the industry more environmentally responsible.\u201d</p><p>Her advice to students considering engineering? \u201cIf you\u2019re curious and want to solve real problems, engineering is for you,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t let stereotypes define your path.

In collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE History Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/globalmuseum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Global Museum</a> and the support of generous donors, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/chip-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_self\">Chip Hall of Fame</a> has been adapted into a traveling exhibit that has just begun making its way around U.S. museums, and, hopefully, the world.</p><p>Our Chip Hall of Fame celebrates microchips that have had a significant impact. Six of the chips from the hall were chosen to be part of the \u201cChips That Shook The World\u201d exhibit, along with artifacts embodying how each was used. One of the chosen was the 8-bit <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6502-microprocessor/\" target=\"_self\">6502</a> processor, so naturally we thought a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/commodore-64\" target=\"_self\">Commodore 64</a> home computer, which used a 6502 variant, should be one of the artifacts. Which led to another thought: Why not have the C64 run a program demonstrating an 8-bit CPU in action?</p><p>That\u2019s how I ended up, 35 years after I last programmed a C64, sitting at my office desk creating a brand-new plug-in cartridge.</p><p>The C64 supported <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Cartridge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plug-in cartridges</a> as a way of distributing software, and our demo program needed to be put on one. Each morning, the museum curator can just turn on the exhibit and presto! The demo program instantly begins running. The alternatives would have required the curator to type in commands to load the demo manually.</p><p>But this convenience comes with two big caveats: One, the demo has to fit into just 16 kilobytes, the maximum size of a cartridge. Even by the standards of the 1980s, this is small, as some C64 titles spanned <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Newcomer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of kilobytes</a> by loading data in chunks from disk or tape. Two, the demo would have to be written in <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-6502-assembly-and-low-level-programming-7c11fa6b9cb9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6502 assembly</a> and control the C64 video hardware directly.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"The components required to make a Commodore 64 cartridge.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"95d88\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-components-required-to-make-a-commodore-64-cartridge.png?id=61614662&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cartridges require only a few components: a printed circuit board [bottom right], programmable memory chip [bottom middle], and some resistors, diodes, and a capacitor [top middle].

To make the video output compatible with modern screens, we used a RetroTink-2X Pro adapter [bottom left].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Fortunately, from attending <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/theyre-alive-vintage-computer-fans-keep-the-great-machines-of-the-past-running\" target=\"_self\">Vintage Computer Federation events</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6ZCubprsSO/\" target=\"_blank\"> over the years</a>, I knew there were a lot of free or inexpensive resources that would make it easier than ever before to do this sort of thing.</p><p>The first step was to figure out just how much I could do in 16 KB. The C64\u2019s graphics hardware was groundbreaking in its day, capable of displaying images of up to 320 by 200 pixels with a palette of 16 colors. It could also display eight sprites at once; each sprite is a moveable single-color 24-by-21 pixel bitmap. The price for this power was complexity. The <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/VIC\" target=\"_blank\">video chip\u2019s control registers</a>, screen bitmaps, text-screen data, default and custom character sets, sprites, and color information all live in different locations scattered across memory, with some data actually living in <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color_RAM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">separate RAM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Character_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ROM</a> chips.</p><p>So I sat down with the detailed <a href=\"https://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">memory maps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Graphics_Modes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video hardware programming guides</a> available for the C64. (This abundance of information is in stark contrast to the 1980s, when documentation was scant, even from Commodore itself). I worked out that I could cram in nine screens of explanatory text, animated graphics, and sprites. Creating these screens, including the custom character sets and sprites they rely on, was greatly simplified thanks to the online C64 graphics editor at <a href=\"https://petscii.krissz.hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">petscii.krissz.hu</a>. The editor can output some results as stand-alone assembly programs, which I adapted as subroutines in my demo code.</p><p>I had just enough space remaining for a lucky find. I wanted to display at least one full-screen bitmapped image, but a prerendered image would have required 8 KB of data, half the cartridge\u2019s capacity. Instead I decided to use a classic hack of programmers since the days of games like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Rogue</em></em></a><em> </em>and<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Elite</em></em></a>: pulling free data out of the structure of mathematics by way of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">procedural generation</a>.</p><p>Here\u2019s where I got lucky: I came across the work of Marcello M., who had published the source for a C64 <a href=\"https://retro64.altervista.org/blog/the-mandelbrot-set-c64-assembly-program-to-draw-it-fast-using-integer-math-part-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assembly program</a> that quickly created a multicolor fractal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mandelbrot set</a> using just 3.3 KB of code. With Marcello\u2019s blessing, I incorporated his code as another subroutine.</p><h2>Modern Tools For Writing C64 Software</h2><p>The coding was done using the free <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ide65xx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IDE 65xx</a> and <a href=\"https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kick Assembler</a> desktop software. I was able to test the code using the popular C64 <a href=\"https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vice emulator</a>, which allowed me to do handy things like examining live memory contents to find runtime bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A diagram showing 64 kilobytes of RAM with a Kernal ROM occupying the top 8 KB, followed by 4 KB of character ROM, and then 8 KB of Basic ROM. Another column shows I/O and color RAM mapped to the same position as the character ROM, and two shadow ROM locations in lower memory. Finally a third column shows a 16 KB cartridge ROM overlapping the Basic ROM and the memory below it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"71b5d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-64-kilobytes-of-ram-with-a-kernal-rom-occupying-the-top-8-kb-followed-by-4-kb-of-character-rom-and-then-8-kb.png?id=61613059&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Regions of the Commodore 64\u2019s RAM were mapped to things like the system ROMs, video-color memory, and the bitmaps of characters, the latter of which were actually mapped to multiple locations in RAM when accessed by the video hardware. Some of these mappings overlapped: Inserting a 16-KB cartridge automatically disabled the ROM storing the Basic interpreter. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p><span>The next step was to make a physical cartridge. Again, there\u2019s modern help, this time in the form of US $5 printed circuit boards that need just a handful of components soldered in to make a cartridge. These components include a programmable ROM chip that I picked up for </span><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/363498306025\" target=\"_blank\">$3 on eBay</a><span>. I burned my code to the memory chip with my trusty </span><a href=\"http://autoelectric.cn/EN/TL866_main.html\" target=\"_blank\">TL866 programmer</a><span> and mounted it to the PCB, which in turn was mounted into a </span><a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:692797\" target=\"_blank\">3D-printed cartridge case</a><span>.</span></p><p>Then came the moment of truth. It probably won\u2019t come as a surprise to regular readers that I already own an original C64, which I connect to modern flat-screen displays via a <a href=\"https://www.retrotink.com/shop/retrotink-2x-pro\" target=\"_blank\">RetroTink-2X Pro</a> adapter. So I carefully pushed the cartridge into its slot and turned the machine on.</p><p>Naturally, my C64 immediately froze up. I had forgotten to remove a little bit of memory-management code that made the demo work in the Vice emulator by disabling the ROM that stores the C64\u2019s Basic interpreter. On the real hardware, this snippet ended up disabling half the cartridge\u2019s memory. A quick edit and a trip back to the TL866 and I was ready to try again. Success! I was finally literally ready to ship some software, all the way to <a href=\"https://www.uplandexhibits.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Upland Exhibits</a>, the people building our traveling display.</p><p>I hope you get a chance to see my little demo and our \u201cChips That Changed The World\u201d exhibit in person: We\u2019ll post current and upcoming locations on the Chip Hall of Fame page. But in the meantime, whether you used the C64 back in the day, or are just looking for a fun coding challenge, I recommend trying your hand at programming this 8-bit classic, now that so many of the original pain points have been reduced!</p>"

The antenna was 15.24 meters long by 6.1 meters wide, weighing in at 16,329 kilograms.

Semiconductor manufacturing, large physics experiments in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-hadron-collider-starts-up\" target=\"_blank\">particle</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/black-holes-bumping-in-the-light-ligo-hears-gravitational-waves-with-increasing-sensitivity\" target=\"_blank\">wave detection</a>, some <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-network-interface\" target=\"_self\">quantum-computing platforms</a>, and surface-analysis tools, including <a href=\"https://sustainable-nano.com/2017/07/26/x-ray-photoelectron-spectroscopy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</a>, all require so-called ultrahigh vacuum.</p><p>At these low levels of particles per unit volume, vacuum is parameterized by pressure, measured in pascals. Regular atmospheric pressure is 10<span><sup>5</sup></span> Pa. Ultrahigh vacuum is considered to be anything less than about 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Some applications require as low as 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa. The deepest depths of space still hold the nothingness record, reaching below 10<span><sup>-20</sup></span> Pa.</p><p>The method of choice for measuring pressure in the ultrahigh vacuum regime is the ionization gauge. \u201cThey work by a fairly straightforward mechanism that dates back to vacuum tubes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/stephen-eckel\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Eckel</a>, a member of the cold-atom vacuum-measurement team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"red light shining from a circular window in a metal vacuum chamber. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4bd3f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/red-light-shining-from-a-circular-window-in-a-metal-vacuum-chamber.png?id=61612440&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A portable cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool [top] detects the fluorescence of roughly 1 million lithium atoms [bottom], and infers the vacuum pressure based on how quickly the fluorescence decays. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Photos: Jayme Thornton</small></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"small dot of red light in the middle of a circular window. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09866\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/small-dot-of-red-light-in-the-middle-of-a-circular-window.png?id=61609895&amp;width=980\" /></p><p>Indeed, an ionization gauge has the same basic components as a vacuum tube. The gauge contains a heated filament that emits electrons into the chamber. The electrons are accelerated toward a positively charged grid. En route to the grid, the electrons occasionally collide with atoms and molecules flying around in the vacuum, knocking off their electrons and creating positively charged ions. These ions are then collected by a negatively charged electrode. The current generated by these positive ions is proportional to the number of atoms floating about in the vacuum, giving a pressure reading.</p><p>Ion gauges are relatively cheap (under US $1,000) and commonplace. However, they come with a few difficulties. First, although the current in the ion gauge is proportional to the pressure in the chamber, that proportionality constant depends on a lot of fine details, such as the precise geometry of the filament and the grid. The current cannot be easily calculated from the electrical and physical characteristics of the setup\u2014ion gauges require thorough calibrations. \u201cA full calibration run on the ion gauges is like a full month of somebody\u2019s time,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/daniel-barker\" target=\"_blank\"> Daniel Barker</a>, a physicist at NIST who\u2019s also working on the cold-atom vacuum-measurement project.</p><p>Second, the calibration services provided by NIST (among others) calibrate down to only 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Performance below that pressure is questionable, even for a well-calibrated gauge. What\u2019s more, at lower pressures, the heat from the ion gauge becomes a problem: Hotter surfaces emit atoms in a process called outgassing, which pollutes the vacuum. \u201cIf you\u2019re shooting for a vacuum chamber with really low pressures,\u201d Madison says, \u201cthese ionization gauges actually work against you, and many people turn them off.\u201d</p><p>Third, the reading on the ion gauge depends very strongly on the types of atoms or molecules present in the vacuum. Different types of atoms could produce readings that vary by up to a factor of four. This variance is fine if you know exactly what\u2019s inside your vacuum chamber, or if you don\u2019t need that precise a measurement. But for certain applications, especially in research settings, these concerns are significant.</p><h2>How a cold-atom vacuum standard works</h2><p>The idea of a cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool developed as a surprising side effect of the study of cold atoms. Scientists first started cooling atoms down in an effort to make better atomic clocks back in the 1970s. Since then, cooling atoms and trapping them has become a cottage industry, giving rise to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-atomic-clocks\" target=\"_self\">optical atomic clocks</a>, atomic <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/accelerometer-quantum-bose-einstein\" target=\"_self\">navigation systems</a>, and neutral-atom quantum computers.</p><p>These experiments have to be done in a vacuum, to prevent the surrounding environment from heating the atoms. For decades, the vacuum was thought of as merely a finicky factor to be implemented as well as possible. \u201cVacuum limitations on atom traps have been known since the dawn of atom traps,\u201d Eckel says. Atoms flying around the vacuum chamber would collide with the cooled atoms and knock them out of their trap, leading to loss. The better the vacuum, the slower that process would go.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A glass cylinder with a coil inside it on a gray background. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b512d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-glass-cylinder-with-a-coil-inside-it-on-a-gray-background.png?id=61609862&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The most common vacuum-measurement tool in the high-vacuum range today is the ion gauge, basically a vacuum tube in reverse: A hot filament emits electrons that fly toward a positively charged grid, ionizing background atoms and molecules along the way. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p>UBC\u2019s Kirk Madison and his collaborator <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-booth-57a28b12/?originalSubdomain=ca\" target=\"_blank\">James Booth</a> (then at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, in Burnaby), were among the first to turn that thinking on its <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.80.022712\" target=\"_blank\">head</a> back in the 2000s. Instead of battling the vacuum to preserve the trapped atoms, they thought, why not use the trapped atoms as a <a href=\"https://patents.justia.com/patent/8803072\" target=\"_blank\">sensor</a> to measure how empty the vacuum is?<p>To understand how they did that, consider a typical cold-atom vacuum-measurement device. Its main component is a vacuum chamber filled with a vapor of a particular atomic species. Some experiments use rubidium, while others use lithium. Let\u2019s call it lithium between friends.</p><p>A tiny amount of lithium gas is introduced into the vacuum, and some of it is captured in a magneto-optical trap. The trap consists of a magnetic field with zero intensity at the center of the trap, increasing gradually away from the center. Six laser beams point toward the center from above, below, the left, the right, the front, and the back. The magnetic and laser forces are arranged so that any lithium atom that might otherwise fly away from the center is most likely to absorb a photon from the lasers, getting a momentum kick back into the trap.</p><p>The trap is quite shallow, meaning that hot atoms\u2014above 1 kelvin or so\u2014will not be captured. So the result is a small, confined cloud of really cold atoms, at the center of the trap. Because the atoms absorb laser light occasionally to keep them in the trap, they also reemit light, creating fluorescence. Measuring this fluorescence allows scientists to calculate how many atoms are in the trap.</p><p>To use this setup to measure vacuum, you load the atoms into the magneto-optical trap and measure the fluorescence. Then, you turn off the light and hold the atoms in just the magnetic field. During this time, background atoms in the vacuum will chance upon the trapped atoms, knocking them out. After a little while, you turn the light back on and check how much the fluorescence has decreased. This measures how many atoms got knocked out, and therefore how many collisions occurred.</p><p>The reason you need the trap to be so shallow and the atoms to be so cold is that these collisions are very weak. \u201cA few collisions are quite energetic, but most of the background gas particles fly by and, like, whisper to the trapped atom, and it just gently moves away,\u201d Madison says.</p><p>This method has several advantages over the traditional ion-gauge measurement. The atomic method does not need calibration; the rate at which fluorescence dims depending on the vacuum pressure can be calculated accurately. These calculations are involved, but in a paper published in 2023 the NIST team <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article/5/3/035001/2905161/Accurate-measurement-of-the-loss-rate-of-cold\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated</a> that the latest method of calculation shows excellent agreement with their experiment. Because this technique does not require calibration, it can serve as a primary standard for vacuum pressure, and even potentially be used to calibrate ion gauges.</p><p>The cold-atom measurement is also much less finicky when it comes to the actual contents of the vacuum. Whether the vacuum is contaminated with helium or plutonium, the measured pressure will vary by perhaps only a few percent, while the ion gauge sensitivity and reading for these particles might differ by an order of magnitude, Eckel says.</p><p>Cold atoms could also potentially measure much lower vacuum pressures than ion gauges can. The current lowest pressure they\u2019ve reliably measured is around 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa, and NIST scientists are working on figuring out what the lower boundary might be. \u201cWe honestly don\u2019t know what the lower limit is, and we\u2019re still exploring that question,\u201d Eckel says.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"A chart of vacuum pressures in the universe\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b1f21\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-of-vacuum-pressures-in-the-universe.png?id=61612598&amp;width=980\" /><p class=\"caption\">No vacuum is completely empty. The degree to which vacuum pressure approaches pure nothingness is measured in pascals, with Earth\u2019s atmosphere clocking in at 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and intergalactic space at a measly 10<sup>-20</sup>. In between, the new cold-atom vacuum gauges can measure further along the emptiness scale than the well-established ionization gauges can.</p><p class=\"media-photo-credit\">Sources: S. Eckel (cold-atom gauge, ionization gauge); K. Zou (molecular-beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition); L. Monteiro, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.luizmonteiro.com/StdAtm.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1976 Standard Atmosphere Properties</a>\u201d (Earth\u2019s atmosphere); E.J. \u00d6pik, <em><em>Planetary and Space Science</em></em> (1962) (Mars, moon atmosphere); A. Chambers, \u2018Modern Vacuum Physics\u201d (2004) (interplanetary and intergalactic space)</p><p>Of course, the cold-atom approach also has drawbacks. It struggles at higher pressure, above 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa, so its applications are confined to the ultrahigh vacuum range. And, although there are no commercial atomic vacuum sensors available yet, they are likely to be much more expensive than ion gauges, at least to start.</p><p>That said, there are many applications where these devices could unlock new possibilities. At large science experiments, including LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and ones at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), well-placed cold-atom vacuum sensors could measure the vacuum pressure and also help determine where a potential leak might be coming from.</p><p>In semiconductor development, a particularly promising application is molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). MBE is used to produce the few, highly pure semiconductor layers used in laser diodes and devices for high-frequency electronics and quantum technologies. The technique functions in ultrahigh vacuum, with pure elements in separate containers heated on one end of the vacuum. The elements travel across the vacuum until they hit the target surface, where they grow one layer at a time.</p><p>Precisely controlling the proportion of the ingredient elements is essential to the success of MBE. Normally, this requires a lot of trial and error, building up thin films and checking whether the proportions are correct, then adjusting as needed. With a cold-atom vacuum sensor, the quantity of each element emitted into the vacuum can be detected on the fly, greatly speeding up the process.</p><p>\u201cIf this technique could be used in molecular-beam epitaxy or other ultrahigh vacuum environments, I think it will really benefit materials development,\u201d says <a href=\"https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/ke-zou/\" target=\"_blank\">Ke Zou</a>, an assistant professor of physics at UBC who studies molecular-beam epitaxy. In these high-tech industries, researchers may find that the ability to measure nothing is everything. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue.</em></p>"

Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology obliged.

After NIST\u2019s validation, microscope manufacturers commercialized the SCM, chipmakers adopted them to study integrated circuits, thus opening the door to the next generation of semiconductors.</p><h2>Why the RCA VideoDisc Failed </h2><p>But no story about the scanning capacitance microscope\u2019s triumph would be complete without some discussion of the VideoDisc\u2019s failure.

Why?</p><p>The VideoDisc effort had begun in the early 1960s, when RCA asked itself, \u201cWhat comes after color TV? What will be the next major consumer electronics system?\u201d The company decided that the answer was some type of system to play prerecorded movies and TV shows through your television. RCA was far from alone in pursuing this idea. All of the home video systems under development included a storage medium\u2014film, magnetic tape, nonmagnetic tape, and vinyl discs of various size and composition\u2014and a device to play back the audio and video in high resolution. In addition to magnetic methods, information could be stored using electromechanical, photographic, electron-beam, or optical technologies.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a smiling man in a business suit holding a shiny flat disc and inserting a flat square object into a machine.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"dc554\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-smiling-man-in-a-business-suit-holding-a-shiny-flat-disc-and-inserting-a-flat-square-object-into-a-ma.jpg?id=61609185&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">RCA VideoDiscs were easily damaged by dust and fingerprints, so they were loaded into the SelectaVision player inside plastic sleeves.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Hagley Museum and Library</small></p><p>By 1964, RCA had settled on VideoDiscs. Like a record album (which the company had pioneered), a VideoDisc was a grooved vinyl platter that uses a stylus for playback. Unlike a record, the VideoDisc carried both audio and video, at a much higher density, and the stylus was electrical instead of mechanical. (The VideoDisc is sometimes confused with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc\" target=\"_blank\">LaserDisc</a>, a home video technology of that era that used an optical laser.)</p><p>RCA called its discs Capacitance Electronic Discs. The VideoDisc player spun the 30-centimeter disc at a constant 450 rpm. A metallic stylus traced the depressions and bumps in the disc\u2019s groove by registering differences in capacitance, similar to the way that bringing your finger into contact with a touchscreen causes a detectable change in the screen\u2019s capacitance at that point. Solid-state circuitry unscrambled the frequency-modulated video signal encoded in the capacitance differences. These differences were on the order of femtofarads, and the video signal ran at about 910 megahertz. To get a clear picture, the VideoDisc system required very sensitive capacitance sensors to detect these tiny differences at high frequency.</p><p>Unfortunately, commercialization took much longer than expected. In 1972, RCA announced that its VideoDisc would debut the following year, but it didn\u2019t materialize. An article in <em><em>Popular Science </em></em>in February 1977 anticipated regional sales by the end of that year. But it wasn\u2019t until March 1981 that the RCA SelectaVision system finally hit the market. Despite heavy promotion, it sold poorly and was pulled from the shelves in 1984. In the end, RCA sank about US $500 million over 20 years to develop the VideoDisc, and it was a total flop.</p><h2>How Videotape Vanquished the VideoDisc</h2><p>What went wrong? In a word: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-panasonic-pv1563-vcr\" target=\"_self\">videotape</a>. Magnetic tape, which RCA had rejected, turned out to have greater consumer appeal. Introduced in 1976, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/revisiting-the-vcrs-origins\" target=\"_self\">VHS tapes</a> were cheaper, had more titles available for purchase or rent, and, importantly, allowed owners to record their own programs.</p><p>Perhaps if the VideoDisc had launched in 1973, it might have had a chance. But the technology had other problems. Fingerprints, dust, and scratches torpedoed early designs that envisioned users removing the discs from sleeves as casually as record albums; instead, the final version kept the discs encased in a plastic shell that was then inserted into the player.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a man in a lab coat and tie pulling a flat shiny disc from a protective sleeve labeled RCA SelectaVision.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"55e43\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-in-a-lab-coat-and-tie-pulling-a-flat-shiny-disc-from-a-protective-sleeve-labeled-rca-selectavisio.jpg?id=61607508&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">RCA spent two decades developing its home video system, but in the end the SelectaVision lost out to VHS and VCRs.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Hagley Museum and Library        </small> </p><p>Another problem was running time. In 1977, VideoDiscs could hold only about 30 minutes of material per side. That rose to an hour per side by the time of product launch, but that still meant that any movie over 120 minutes would have to be spread over multiple discs. The first VHS tapes could hold 120 minutes of video (double that of its main tape competitor, Betamax). And VHS kept extending that lead: By the 1980s, VHS had long play (four hours) and extended play (six hours) versions, albeit with noticeable drops in resolution quality.</p><p>RCA forecasters also badly misread the economics of VideoDisc players. Their 1977 price estimate for a VideoDisc player was $500 (about $2,800 in today\u2019s dollars). The first VHS players were much more expensive, ranging from $1,000 to $1,400, but by the mid-1980s, their price had dropped to $200 to $400. VHS tapes of major Hollywood films cost about $80\u2014much more than VideoDiscs\u2019 $10 to $18 price tag\u2014but only diehard fans actually paid the modern equivalent of about $440 to buy a movie on videotape. For everyone else, the Hollywood studios licensed titles to third-party rental companies. Seemingly overnight, independent video shops, supermarkets, and national chains like Blockbuster were renting movies for a small fee. For a brief period, RCA VideoDiscs shared the shelves with videotapes, but usually only at independent shops and never with as many titles available.</p><p>Meanwhile, RCA struggled to sell its VideoDisc players. The company had forecast eventual annual sales of five to six million players; its first-year goal was a more modest 200,000, and yet it sold only half that number. By 1984, RCA realized the VideoDisc would never come close to 50 percent market penetration, let alone profitability, and pulled the plug.</p><h2>Birth of the Scanning Capacitance Microscope</h2><p>Normally that would be the end of the story, another failed venture in consumer electronics. But back when RCA scientists first began researching the VideoDisc, there were no microscopes capable of identifying the tiny variations in the disc that encoded the audio/video signal. The bumps and depressions were less than a tenth the size of the groove itself; even the most advanced microscopes of the day couldn\u2019t detect features that small.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman in a hairnet, lab coat, and white gloves holding a shiny flat disc with a hole in a center, with two stacks of discs in the foreground.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5a291\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-in-a-hairnet-lab-coat-and-white-gloves-holding-a-shiny-flat-disc-with-a-hole-in-a-center-wit.jpg?id=61607494&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A factory worker inspects an RCA VideoDisc, which encoded the audio and video signals in the disc\u2019s groove.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Hagley Museum and Library        </small> </p>And so RCA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrmatey/\" target=\"_blank\">James Matey</a> developed and patented the scanning capacitance microscope (which he abbreviated SCaM, but others wisely shortened to SCM) as a quality-control tool for manufacturing the VideoDiscs. Four years after the first patent, RCA filed a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/USRE32457E/en\" target=\"_blank\">reissue patent</a> with some corrections and improvements. In a very readable paper in the March 1985 issue of the <em><em>Journal of Applied Physics,</em></em> Matey and fellow RCA researcher Joseph Blanc explained the new technology. The SCM could detect variations in surface topography on the order of 0.3 nanometers over areas on the order of 0.5 square micrometers. RCA delayed publication of this paper until it had shuttered the VideoDisc operation, and so Matey and Blanc concluded their paper, \u201cWe are currently in the process of adapting [the SCM] for similar uses on other samples.\u201d The new use turned out to be in the manufacturing of the next generation of semiconductors.<p>Semiconductor performance depends on the distribution of intentionally introduced impurities, called dopants, which change the ability of the material to conduct electricity. In the early days of semiconductor production, manufacturers used ion mass spectroscopy and a technique called spreading resistance to measure the dopant distribution in one dimension.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">Related: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-secondhand-origins-of-silicon-valleys-ingot-industry\" target=\"_self\">The Secondhand Origins of Silicon Valley\u2019s Ingot Industry</a></p><p>By the late 1980s, integrated circuits had become so small that the industry needed a way to measure the dopants in two dimensions. The SCM, used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope, fit the bill. When the conductive tip of the atomic force microscope made contact with a semiconductor surface, it created a small capacitance, on the order of attofarads to femtofarads, depending on the dopant concentration. The SCM measured the changes of the local capacitance and mapped the dopant distributions. But the technology was still novel and not yet commercially available, so researchers at NIST took up the task of testing it.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Joseph Kopanski, Jay Marchiando, and David Berning began building a series of custom SCMs at the NIST Semiconductor Electronics Division. They did more than just reproduce Matey and Blanc\u2019s results. They also provided the industry with models and software for extracting two-dimensional dopant distribution from the capacitance measurements.</p><p>NIST\u2019s validation of the SCM led to the commercial production of the instruments, which in turn led to the development of more-advanced semiconductors\u2014an industry that is orders of magnitude more important to the global economy than a consumer product like the VideoDisc would ever have been. It\u2019s a classic tale of redemption in the history of technology: At the start of any new tech project, no one really knows what the outcome will be. Sometimes, you just have to keep going, even through abject failure, and trust that something good will emerge on the other side.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cRCA\u2019s VideoDisc Gamble Paid Off in Chips.\u201d</em></em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>My friends at NIST first suggested the scanning capacitance microscope in their collection and pointed me to <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/nist-museum/videodiscs-and-scanning-capacitance-microscope-failed-consumer-product-solves\" target=\"_blank\">a great description</a> of it.

And <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/humanoid-robot-market-5-trillion-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley Research estimates</a> that by 2050 there could be over 1 billion humanoid robots, part of a US $5 trillion market.</p><p>But as of now, the market for humanoid robots is almost entirely hypothetical. Even the most successful companies in this space have deployed only a small handful of robots in carefully controlled pilot projects. And future projections seem to be based on an extraordinarily broad interpretation of jobs that a capable, efficient, and safe humanoid robot\u2014which does not currently exist\u2014might conceivably be able to do. Can the current reality connect with the promised scale?</p><h2>What Will It Take to Scale Humanoid Robots?</h2><p>Physically building tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of humanoid robots is certainly possible in the near term. In 2023, <a href=\"https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/record-of-4-million-robots-working-in-factories-worldwide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on the order of 500,000 industrial robots were installed worldwide</a>. Under the basic assumption that a humanoid robot is approximately equivalent to four industrial arms in terms of components, existing supply chains should be able to support even the most optimistic near-term projections for humanoid manufacturing.</p><p>But simply building the robots is arguably the easiest part of scaling humanoids, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meloneewise/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Melonee Wise</a>, who served as chief product officer at Agility Robotics until this month. \u201cThe bigger problem is demand\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone has found an application for humanoids that would require several thousand robots per facility.\u201d Large deployments, Wise explains, are the most realistic way for a robotics company to scale its business, since onboarding any new client can take weeks or months. An alternative approach to deploying several thousand robots to do a single job is to deploy several hundred robots that can each do 10 jobs, which seems to be what most of the humanoid industry is betting on in the medium to long term.</p><p>While there\u2019s a belief across much of the humanoid robotics industry that rapid progress in AI must somehow translate into rapid progress toward multipurpose robots, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/solve-robotics\" target=\"_self\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfvctjoMPk8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clear</a> how, when, or if that will happen. \u201cI think what a lot of people are hoping for is they\u2019re going to AI their way out of this,\u201d says Wise. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is that currently AI is not robust enough to meet the requirements of the market.\u201d</p><h2>Bringing Humanoid Robots to Market</h2><p><span>Market requirements for humanoid robots include a slew of extremely dull, extremely critical things like battery life, reliability, and safety. Of these, battery life is the most straightforward\u2014for a robot to usefully do a job, it can\u2019t spend most of its time charging. The next version of Agility\u2019s Digit robot, which can handle payloads of up to 16 kilograms, includes a bulky \u201cbackpack\u201d containing a battery with a charging ratio of 10 to 1: The robot can run for 90 minutes, and fully recharge in 9 minutes. Slimmer humanoid robots from other companies must necessarily be making compromises to maintain their svelte form factors.</span></p><p>In operation, Digit will probably spend a few minutes charging after running for 30 minutes. That\u2019s because 60 minutes of Digit\u2019s runtime is essentially a reserve in case something happens in its workspace that requires it to temporarily pause, a not-infrequent occurrence in the logistics and manufacturing environments that Agility is targeting. Without a 60-minute reserve, the robot would be much more likely to run out of power mid-task and need to be manually recharged. Consider what that might look like with even a modest deployment of several hundred robots weighing over a hundred kilograms each. \u201cNo one wants to deal with that,\u201d comments Wise.</p><p>Potential customers for humanoid robots are very concerned with downtime. Over the course of a month, a factory operating at 99 percent reliability will see approximately 5 hours of downtime. Wise says that any downtime that stops something like a production line can cost tens of thousands of dollars per minute, which is why many industrial customers expect a couple more 9s of reliability: 99.99 percent. Wise says that Agility has demonstrated this level of reliability in some specific applications, but not in the context of multipurpose or general-purpose functionality.</p><h2>Humanoid Robot Safety</h2><p><span>A humanoid robot in an industrial environment must meet general </span><a href=\"https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/ansi-b11-standards-safety-of-machinery/\" target=\"_blank\">safety</a><span> </span><a href=\"https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2006-42-ec-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a><span> for industrial machines. In the past, robotic systems like autonomous vehicles and drones have benefited from immature regulatory environments to scale quickly. But Wise says that approach can\u2019t work for humanoids, because the industry is already heavily regulated\u2014the robot is simply considered another piece of machinery.</span></p><p>There are also more specific<a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ria/ansiriar15082020\" target=\"_blank\"> safety standards</a> currently under development for humanoid robots, explains Matt Powers, associate director of autonomy R&amp;D at Boston Dynamics. He notes that his company is helping develop an <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/91469.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) safety standard for dynamically balancing legged robots</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that the top players in the field, like Agility and Figure, are joining us in developing a way to explain why we believe that the systems that we\u2019re deploying are safe,\u201d Powers says.</p><p>These standards are necessary because the traditional safety approach of cutting power may not be a good option for a dynamically balancing system. Doing so will cause a humanoid robot to fall over, potentially making the situation even worse. There is no simple solution to this problem, and the initial approach that Boston Dynamics expects to take with its Atlas robot is to keep the robot out of situations where simply powering it off might not be the best option. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with relatively low-risk deployments, and then expand as we build confidence in our safety systems,\u201d Powers says. \u201cI think a methodical approach is really going to be the winner here.\u201d</p><p>In practice, low risk means keeping humanoid robots away from people. But humanoids that are restricted by what jobs they can safely do and where they can safely move are going to have more trouble finding tasks that provide value.</p><h2>Are Humanoids the Answer?</h2><p><span>The issues of demand, battery life, reliability, and safety all need to be solved before humanoid robots can scale.

A small core team will continue on to shut Natcast down over the next few weeks, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The organization was founded in 2023 to run NSTC, which the law established to conduct \u201cresearch and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology and grow the domestic semiconductor workforce to strengthen the economic competitiveness and security of the domestic supply chain.\u201d</p><p>However, on 25 August Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the department <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/natcast\" target=\"_blank\">would not deliver the US $7.4 billion</a> in funds under its contract with the government. In an accusatory <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Natcast-CEO-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to Natcast CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/deirdre-hanford/\" target=\"_blank\">Deirdre Hanford </a>and a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/department-commerce-takes-action-against-biden-administrations\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, Lutnick claimed the nonprofit was not created legally, and said that the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/chips\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> would be taking over NSTC operations.</p><p><span>The Commerce Department has been suppressing Natcast\u2019s operations for many months, </span><em>IEEE Spectrum</em><span> has learned. According to multiple sources, the organization\u2019s research agenda was completed in April and should have been accepted and processed by Commerce in a matter of weeks. But it never happened. A memo selecting awardees for research into </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/prism\" target=\"_blank\">reducing the impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from semiconductor manufacturing</a><span> was submitted to Commerce but never approved. Three groups won parts of a </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-finalizes-aidrfic-research-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">$30 million grant to transform the design of RF chips using machine learning</a><span>, but at least one awardee has gotten no word on when or whether the funding will flow.</span></p><p>\u201cThis is a sad end,\u201d said one person who requested anonymity and was involved in early debate about the NSTC. </p><p>Lutnick\u2019s characterization of Natcast\u2019s creation as cronyism \u201cis pretty frustrating,\u201d this person continued. The idea that NSTC would be operated by an independent public-private partnership, which is written into the law, came from deep consultation with industry and was intended to insulate its work from politics. The organization needed such protection to make good technical decisions, because in selecting who gets funds \u201cthere are always more losers than winners,\u201d this person said.</p><p>Over the past week, Natcast has been defending itself and its staff against Lutnick\u2019s accusations. On 4 September, in a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-member-letter-regarding-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">letter to its 200 members</a>, Hanford countered Lutnick\u2019s assertions that the organization was packed with Biden administration cronies and that it was run as a \u201cslush fund.\u201d Hanford pointed to the multiple layers of government and industry oversight Natcast operates under and the experienced semiconductor industry staff it has brought on. She added that the nonprofit had stuck to its agreements with the government, submitting 119 \u201cmilestones and deliverables\u201d to Commerce.</p><h2>What\u2019s Lost Without Natcast</h2><p>On 8 September, Natcast published a detailed <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-assets-supporting-the-continued-mission-of-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">overview of what it has done so far</a>. Accomplishments included creating an industry-driven R&amp;D agenda, the development of multiple workforce programs, and the signing on of some 200 members. These members included cutting-edge logic and memory companies (such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skhynix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SK Hynix</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona\" target=\"_self\">TSMC</a>), small companies like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/atomera-plans-to-breathe-new-life-into-older-chip-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">Atomera</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=encharge+ai\" target=\"_self\">EnCharge AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">Polar Semiconductor</a>, and multiple universities and makers of semiconductor tools and equipment.</p><p><a href=\"https://natcast.org/nstcmembership/members\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a> had the right to use facilities and other infrastructure that Natcast was standing up (for a fee) and participate in research. One goal for the infrastructure was to reduce the time from concept to prototype by 30 percent. Access to the tools and processes NSTC would provide is out of reach for even some of the country\u2019s top researchers, <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s source said. Without that access, startups and researchers won\u2019t be able to afford to do relevant work using 300-millimeter wafers and advanced chip-technology nodes. Despite the fact that not all of its facilities were complete, Natcast had plans to proceed with research by chaining together existing infrastructure around the country.</p><p>In addition, the document from 8 September detailed the expert in-house team at Natcast, and said that expertise allowed it to evaluate R&amp;D awards at twice the rate of federal agencies while requiring considerably less overhead than government, universities, and non-profit research organizations like Imec. (It forecast a 10 percent overhead on expenses over 10 years.)</p><p>\u201cNatcast was supposed to do what industry couldn\u2019t solve by itself,\u201d said a source familiar with the situation. Its R&amp;D program was aimed at solving big problems, such as collapsing the time and energy required to <a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/smap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">move data between memory and computing</a>, in a way that the whole industry could benefit from.<span></span></p>"

The exploit impacts Unitree\u2019s Go2 and B2 quadrupeds and G1 and H1 humanoids. Because the vulnerability is wireless, and the resulting access to the affected platform is complete, the vulnerability becomes wormable, </span><a href=\"https://github.com/Bin4ry/UniPwn?tab=readme-ov-file#the-wormable-threat\" target=\"_blank\">say the researchers</a>, meaning \u201ca<span>n infected robot can simply scan for other Unitree robots in BLE range and automatically compromise them, creating a robot botnet that spreads without user intervention.\u201d</span></p><p>Initially discovered by security researchers Andreas Makris and Kevin Finisterre, <a href=\"https://github.com/Bin4ry/UniPwn\" target=\"_blank\">UniPwn</a> takes advantage of several security lapses that are still present in the firmware of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/unitree\" target=\"_blank\">Unitree</a> robots as of 20 September, 2025. As far as <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> is aware, this is the first major public exploit of a commercial humanoid platform.</p><h2>Unitree Robots\u2019 BLE Security Flaw Exposed</h2><p>Like many robots, Unitree\u2019s robots use an initial BLE connection to make it easier for a user to set up a Wi-Fi network connection. The BLE packets that the robot accepts are encrypted, but those encryption keys are hardcoded and were <a href=\"https://x.com/Bin4ryDigit/status/1950566849072005304\" target=\"_blank\">published on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by Makris in July. Although the robot does validate the contents of the BLE packets to make sure that the user is authenticated, the researchers say that all it takes to become an authenticated user is to encrypt the string \u2018unitree\u2019 with the hardcoded keys and the robot will let someone in. From there, an attacker can inject arbitrary code masquerading as the Wi-Fi SSID and password, and when the robot attempts to connect to Wi-Fi, it will execute that code without any validation and with root privileges.</p><p>\u201cA simple attack might be just to reboot the robot, which we published as a proof-of-concept,\u201d explains Makris. \u201cBut an attacker could do much more sophisticated things: It would be possible to have a trojan implanted into your robot\u2019s startup routine to exfiltrate data while disabling the ability to install new firmware without the user knowing. And as the vulnerability uses BLE, the robots can easily infect each other, and from there the attacker might have access to an army of robots.\u201d</p><p>Makris and Finisterre first contacted Unitree in May in an attempt to responsibly disclose this vulnerability. After some back and forth with little progress, Unitree stopped responding to the researchers in July, and the decision was made to make the vulnerability public. \u201cWe have had some bad experiences communicating with them,\u201d Makris tells us, citing an <a href=\"https://takeonme.org/cves/cve-2025-2894/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier backdoor vulnerability</a> he discovered with the Unitree Go1. \u201cSo we need to ask ourselves\u2014are they introducing vulnerabilities like this on purpose, or is it sloppy development? Both answers are equally bad.\u201d Unitree has not responded to a request for comment from <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> as of press time.</p><p>\u201cUnitree, as other manufacturers do, has simply ignored prior security disclosures and repeated outreach attempts,\u201d says V\u00edctor Mayoral-Vilches, the founder of robotics cybersecurity company <a href=\"https://aliasrobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alias Robotics</a>. \u201cThis is not the right way to cooperate with security researchers.\u201d Mayoral-Vilches was not involved in publishing the UniPwn exploit, but he has found <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vmayoral_cybersecurity-ai-humanoid-robots-as-attack-activity-7374789262157901824-nE0I/\" target=\"_blank\">other security issues</a> with Unitree robots, including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14139\" target=\"_blank\">undisclosed streaming of telemetry data to servers in China</a> which could potentially include audio, visual, and spatial data.</p><p>Mayoral-Vilches explains that security researchers are focusing on Unitree primarily because the robots are available and affordable. This makes them not just more accessible for the researchers, but also more relevant, since Unitree\u2019s robots are already being deployed by users around the world who are likely not aware of the security risks. For example, Makris is concerned that the <a href=\"https://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/news/nottinghamshire/news/news/2025/august/officers-testing-revolutionary-robot-dog/\" target=\"_blank\">Nottinghamshire Police in the UK have begun testing a Unitree Go2</a>, which can be exploited by UniPwn. \u201cWe tried contacting them and would have disclosed the vulnerability upfront to them before going public, but they ignored us. What would happen if an attacker implanted themselves into one of these police dogs?\u201d</p><h2>How to Secure Unitree Robots</h2><p>In the short term, Mayoral-Vilches suggests that people using Unitree robots can protect themselves by only connecting the robots to isolated Wi-Fi networks and disabling their Bluetooth connectivity. \u201cYou need to hack the robot to secure it for real,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not uncommon and why security research in robotics is so important.\u201d</p><p>Both Mayoral-Vilches and Makris believe that fundamentally it\u2019s up to Unitree to make their robots secure in the long term, and that the company needs to be much more responsive to users and security researchers. But Makris says: \u201cThere will never be a 100 percent secure system.\u201d</p><p>Mayoral-Vilches agrees. \u201cRobots are very complex systems, with wide attack surfaces to protect, and a state-of-the-art humanoid exemplifies that complexity.\u201d</p><p>Unitree, of course, is not the only company offering complex state-of-the-art quadrupeds and humanoids, and it seems likely (if not inevitable) that similar exploits will be discovered in other platforms. The <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/navigating-the-dual-use-dilemma\" target=\"_blank\">potential consequences</a> here can\u2019t be overstated\u2014the idea that robots can be taken over and used for nefarious purposes is already a science fiction trope, but the impact of a high-profile robot hack on the reputation of the commercial robotics industry is unclear. Robots companies are barely talking about security in public, despite how damaging even the <em><em>perception</em></em> of an unsecured robot might be. A robot that is not under control has the potential to be a real physical danger.</p><p>At the <a href=\"https://2025humanoids.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Humanoids Conference</a> in Seoul from 30 September to 2 October, Mayoral-Vilches has organized <a href=\"https://aliasrobotics.com/cs4r_3.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a workshop on Cybersecurity for Humanoids</a>, where he will present a brief (co-authored with Makris and Finisterre) titled <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14139v2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Humanoid Robots as Attack Vectors</a>. Despite the title, their intent is not to overhype the problem but instead to encourage roboticists (and robotics companies) to take security seriously, and not treat it as an afterthought. As Mayoral-Vilches points out, \u201crobots are only safe if secure.\u201d</p>"

The area had about 28 small semiconductor companies at the time, many launched from the nanofabrication facility housed at University of California, Santa Barbara, where John works. But as these companies expand, \u201cthey are all headhunting the same 10 people, basically,\u201d John says.</p><p>\u201cIt really was hindering their ability to scale. When you start up a company, you might have five or six highly educated people,\u201d he says. \u201cAs [companies] get bigger and they go beyond the research devices, they really need technicians to start making more chips.\u2026 That\u2019s where they often had these problems.\u201d</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>Now, following the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-map\" target=\"_self\">CHIPS and Science Act</a> of 2022 and increasing investment from companies like Intel and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona\" target=\"_self\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.</a>, the United States is expecting a shortage of workers who can staff new facilities. In the next few years, tens of thousands of additional skilled workers will be needed across the semiconductor industry; in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/reimagining-labor-to-close-the-expanding-us-semiconductor-talent-gap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey & Co. estimated</a> a talent gap between 59,000 and 146,000 engineers and technicians before the end of the decade. As the United States invests in reshoring chip manufacturing, the industry faces a dilemma: How can the semiconductor workforce scale to meet the coming demand?</p><p>Efforts to develop a strong workforce have grown, for example with government-funded initiatives from the Microelectronics Commons, a U.S. Department of Defense program that established eight hubs across the country to bridge research and manufacturing. (The National Semiconductor Technology Center was also established by the CHIPS Act in part for workforce development. However, in late August, the Commerce Department <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/natcast\" target=\"_self\">revoked funding from the nonprofit</a> that was set up to administer the program.) Through a combination of federal programs, state funding, and private-sector partnerships, U.S. colleges and universities are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-workforce-development\" target=\"_self\">working to increase talent</a>.</p><p>To fill the gap, some universities\u2014including UC Santa Barbara\u2014are also offering microcredential programs separate from <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-design-enrollment\" target=\"_self\">traditional degree programs</a>. In these bite-size courses, which can be as short as a week or two, future engineers and technicians can gain critical hands-on experience in clean-room fundamentals or an introduction to topics like lithography or etching. Deploying short, standardized, and skill-based courses across the country could be an essential part of building a sustainable U.S. semiconductor workforce.</p><h2>Developing Microcredentials</h2><p>UC Santa Barbara launched its clean-room training in 2021, opening the university\u2019s clean room to enrolled students as well as those from outside the university, including community college students and people looking to make a career change. Many universities already have clean rooms where they teach undergraduates about semiconductor fabrication, but students outside of a four-year degree program typically can\u2019t access these facilities to gain the necessary training.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big mismatch in culture between companies and city colleges and universities. They all want to solve the same problem, but they don\u2019t actually understand each other\u2019s needs that well,\u201d John says. To him, the importance of these courses is in aligning the needs of the industry, students, and educational institutions.</p><p>While developing the UC Santa Barbara course, however, John was surprised to find there was no established educational standard for those wishing to enter the semiconductor workforce outside of a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Scientist in cleanroom suit handling silicon wafers in a semiconductor manufacturing facility.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e44fd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/scientist-in-cleanroom-suit-handling-silicon-wafers-in-a-semiconductor-manufacturing-facility.png?id=61607711&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A student at UC Santa Barbara loads wafers into a machine used for plasma etching. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ben Werner</small></p><p>Since then, he has collaborated with several other institutions and organizations working to implement a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-microcredential-program-2671959389\" target=\"_self\">microcredential program developed by IEEE</a> in partnership with the University of Southern California (USC) as part of <a href=\"https://dreamsgold.org/ieee-micro-credentials/\" target=\"_blank\">California DREAMS (Defense Ready Electronics and Microdevices Superhub)</a>, funded by the DOD. Other programs also offer short training courses, but the standardization IEEE aims to provide is important for ensuring participants\u2019 skills are widely recognized by employers across the country.</p><p>Initially, John aimed to address the shortage of technicians to help companies scale up production. But as the courses have expanded elsewhere, it has become clear that the same hands-on experience can be used for engineering students as well.</p><p>Students who take these introductory courses may go on to join the workforce or continue in their education to a bachelor\u2019s or advanced degree. \u201cThe entire ladder of different workforce exits into the semiconductor industry is really important,\u201d says John. The industry needs operators and technicians, who may seek employment right after high school, as well as Ph.D.-level engineers. \u201cThese microcredentials get somebody into the start of that workforce ladder.\u201d</p><h2>What the Semiconductor Industry Needs</h2><p>Microcredentials assure employers that applicants have the skills needed to work in their fabs. A common misconception is that companies need students who have already been taught how to build their particular technology. But \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter exactly which specific device you made. What matters is that this person has had the experience of making some real chip,\u201d John says. He compares it to carpentry: Someone who has spent time in a woodshop making furniture may not know how to frame a house, but \u201call the tools are basically the same. I know they can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>So, in addition to specific skills, the course demonstrates a student\u2019s ability to learn the processes\u2014and tolerate the environment. With its loud machines, safety procedures, and protective bunny suits, the clean room isn\u2019t a typical workplace. Having students experience that environment lowers the risk of employers hiring someone who dislikes it.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter exactly which specific device you made. What matters is that this person has had the experience of making some real chip.\u201d <strong>\u2014Demis John</strong></p><p>The course has students spend several days in a clean room, which is more likely than a single clean-room day to filter out participants who wouldn\u2019t last. That\u2019s important for companies that invest a lot of resources in hiring and training new people, notes the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/darickbaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Darick Baker</a>, who serves as acting director of the Washington Nanofabrication Facility, in Seattle. </p><h2>Can Hands-On Courses Scale Up?</h2><p>The hands-on experience is a critical part of semiconductor microcredential programs, because companies want employees who are excited about building things. But it also inherently limits how many students can enroll at once. \u201cIf I can handle 12 students at a time, maybe there\u2019s the pathway to 100 students a year. But that\u2019s not the numbers we need,\u201d says Baker.</p><p>Instead, scalability will likely come from offering courses more frequently, and at more universities. Many universities already have a clean room and courses for university students, John says, so the goal was to make it easy for universities to adapt programs already in place to fit with the microcredential program. This also requires training of the instructors. USC, for example, offers a microcredential for instructors themselves in a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d model.</p><p>For 10 years, Baker has run clean-room training courses during which students make a diode. He became excited about the possibility of awarding students IEEE\u2019s professional microcredentials as a way to give students an advantage in the job market.</p><p>Baker visited USC and UC Santa Barbara to observe their programs and realized they were already quite similar to his. With a few small changes, he could make his program meet the requirements for IEEE microcredentials. His hope is that \u201csomebody can look at that credential and say, maybe this person doesn\u2019t know everything about working at a fab, but they spent one week gowned-up in a bunny suit. They\u2019re not going to quit in that first month because they can\u2019t handle being in the lab.\u201d</p><p>Currently, these programs may have significance mostly to local employers. But \u201cnationally, it starts to take meaning when you have a critical mass of universities that are offering these credentials,\u201d says Baker. \u201cThe more universities we can get on board with this, the more meaning that credential has.\u201d</p>"

Since the widespread adoption of AI tools began in late 2022, a split has appeared, and early-career software engineers are among the hardest hit.</p><p>The researchers used data from the largest payroll provider in the United States, <a href=\"https://www.adp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Automatic Data Processing</a> (ADP), to gain up-to-date employment and earning data for millions of workers across industries, locations, and age groups.

Each age group is divided into five groups, based on AI exposure, and normalized to 1 in October 2022\u2014roughly when popular generative AI tools became available to the public.</span></p><p><span>The trend may be a harbinger for more widespread changes, and the researchers plan to continue tracking the data. \u201cIt could be that there are reversals in these employment declines. It could be that other age groups become more or less exposed [to generative AI] and have differing patterns in their employment trends.

He and his colleagues wanted to find data on what\u2019s happening now.</p><p><span><span>Since late 2022, early-career software engineers (between 22 and 30 years old) have experienced a decline in employment. At the same time, mid-level and senior employment has remained stable or grown. This is happening across the most AI-exposed jobs, and software engineering is a prime example.</span></span></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25205019/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p class=\"caption\">Since late 2022, employment for early-career software developers has dropped. Employment for other age groups, however, has seen modest growth.</p><p><span>Chandar cautions that, for specific occupations, the trend may not be driven by AI alone; other changes in the tech industry could also be causing the drop. Still, the fact that it holds across industries suggests that there\u2019s a real effect from AI.</span></p><p>The Stanford team also looked at a broader category of \u201ccomputer occupations\u201d based on the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Bureau of Labor</a> classifications\u2014which includes hardware engineers, web developers, and more\u2014and found similar results.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25218080/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p class=\"caption\">Growth in employment between October 2022 and July 2025 by age and AI exposure group.

Jobs in which AI tools augment work did not see the same declines in employment, compared to roles involving tasks that could be automated.</p><p>This part of the analysis was based on Anthropic\u2019s index alone. \u201cIdeally, we would love to get more data on AI usage from the other AI companies as well, especially Open AI and Google,\u201d Chandar says. (A recent paper from researchers at Microsoft did find that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07935\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot usage aligned closely</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj0998\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> of AI exposure the Stanford team used.)</p><p><span>Going forward, the team also hopes to expand to data on employment outside of the United States.</span></p>"
