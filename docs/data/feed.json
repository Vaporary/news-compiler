        "summary": "We document that rising volatility in U.S. interest rates, a key dimension of global financial risk, notably depresses the trend of economic activity in emerging market economies (EMEs) but not in advanced economies (AEs). Using a panel state-space model, we show that a one standard- deviation shock to U.S. monetary policy uncertainty permanently lowers the level of GDP in EMEs by about 25 basis points after three years, with negligible effects in AEs. We rationalize this fact in a small open economy model where firms borrow against future profits to finance innovation. Higher volatility compresses firm values, tightens collateral constraints, and endogenously slows productivity growth, especially when financial frictions are severe."

Using nationally representative household consumption surveys from 23 countries that together account for 50% of the world\u2019s poor, we estimate that reducing the poverty rate to 1% (from a baseline of 12% at the time of last survey) would cost $170B nominal per year. This is 5.5 times the corresponding reduction in the aggregate poverty gap, but only 19% of the cost of universal basic income. Extrapolated globally, the results correspond to a cost of (approximately) ending extreme poverty of roughly 0.3% of global GDP."

        "summary": "The Opportunity Zone program was designed to encourage investment in distressed communities across the United States. Early research found no evidence of impacts of the program on employment, earnings, or poverty of zone residents, but some evidence of positive effects on employment among businesses in zones. Using the latest survey-based as well as administrative data, we adopt a longer-run and more comprehensive perspective on the labor market impacts of OZs. We find that OZ designation increases job creation among businesses within zones. However, a large share of the newly created jobs in zones is offset by declines in nearby low-income communities. While we detect gains in OZ resident employment over the longer run, the increase comes from jobs with workplaces outside of OZs that, in light of the changing demographic composition of zones, are likely held by new as opposed to existing residents. Overall, our results suggest that OZs have limited benefits for existing residents of targeted areas and are associated mainly with a spatial reallocation of jobs and households."

We provide a complete theory of comparative statics for technological change in general multidimensional assignment models. Our main result is that any technological change is uniquely decomposed into two distinct components. The first component (gradient) gives a characterization of changes in marginal earnings through a Poisson equation. The second component (divergence-free) gives a characterization of labor reallocation. For U.S. data, we quantify equilibrium responses in sorting and earnings with respect to cognitive skill-biased technological change."

While more than half of product innovations originate from non-patenting firms, patent filings are on average followed by subsequent product introductions. Yet this relationship weakens with firm size. Patents held by market leaders also yield revenue premiums beyond what can be explained by their own product introductions and are associated with stronger deterrence of competitors\u2019 innovations. To interpret these findings, we develop a simple growth model in which larger firms have stronger incentives to engage in strategic patenting\u2014filing for protection rather than market innovation\u2014which dampens innovation and slows creative destruction."

This paper studies the role of innovations that introduce specialized financial products using a combination of granular data and a parsimonious model of security issuance. We present three key findings. First, differential product adoption across firms explains most of the observed variation in the amounts of funds raised. Second, firms that adopt new products are more successful in raising funds. Third, the funds raised from new financial products are often sourced from numerous highly specialized products, each used by only a few firms."

We then present a theoretical framework for maximizing the benefits of Ukraine\u2019s rebuilding effort to highlight the welfare effects of different allocations of post-war infrastructure. Finally, we consider the cost curve for reconstruction, as determined, in particular, by the cost of materials, labor, the industrial organization of the building industry and public practices in procurement and regulation. We highlight three broad strategies for shifting the cost curve: openness, standardization and investing-in-investing. We conclude by outlining areas for future research."

In its most high-dollar nuclear deal yet, the Trump administration in October launched <a href=\"https://westinghousenuclear.com/strategic-partnership/press-releases/brookfield/\" target=\"_blank\">a partnership to build at least $80 billion</a> worth of new, large-scale nuclear reactors, and chose <a href=\"https://westinghouse.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopW1I1bjAmm29LWgcnJ_FkucTWL5pWaydkuLVAE5MtcCeaE4z1Q\" target=\"_blank\">Westinghouse Electric Company</a> and its co-owners, Brookfield Asset Management and Cameco, for the job.</p><p>The money will support the construction of AP1000s, a type of pressurized water reactor developed by Westinghouse that can generate about 1,110 megawatts of electric power. These are the same reactors as units 3 and 4 at the <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vogtle-unit-4-enters-commercial-operation-302129976.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vogtle nuclear plant</a> in Georgia, which wrapped up seven years behind schedule in 2023 and 2024 and cost more than <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=57280\" target=\"_blank\">twice as much</a> as expected\u2014about $35 billion for the pair. Along the way, Westinghouse, based in Cranberry Township, Penn., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p><p>Chief executives of investor-owned utilities know that if they were to propose committing to similar projects on the same commercial terms, they\u2019d be sacked on the spot. As a result, the private sector in the United States has been unwilling to take on the financial risk inherent in building new reactors.</p><p>The $80 billion deal with the federal government represents the U.S. nuclear industry\u2019s best opportunity in a generation for a large-scale construction program. But ambition doesn\u2019t guarantee successful execution. The delays and cost overruns that dogged the Vogtle project present real threats for the next wave of reactors.</p><h2>Streamlining AP1000 Reactor Construction</h2><p>What might be different about the next set of AP1000s? On the positive side, delivering multiple copies of the same reactor ought to create the conditions for a steady decline in costs. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/slow-steady-progress-for-two-us-nuclear-power-projects\" target=\"_self\">Vogtle Unit 3 was the first AP1000 to be built</a> in the United States, and the lessons learned from it resulted in Vogtle Unit 4 costing 30 percent less than Unit 3. (Six AP1000s are currently operating outside the United States, and 14 more are under construction, according to Westinghouse.)</p><p>There\u2019s been a bipartisan effort in the United States to streamline regulatory procedures to ensure that future projects won\u2019t be delayed by the same issues that hampered Vogtle. The Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1111\" target=\"_blank\">(ADVANCE) Act</a> that was signed into law by former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2024, includes several measures intended to improve processes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An industrial site hosting four conical towers with smoke billowing out and a sunset in the background. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d4aa1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-industrial-site-hosting-four-conical-towers-with-smoke-billowing-out-and-a-sunset-in-the-background.jpg?id=62599125&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The last nuclear reactors to be built in the United States\u2014Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Waynesboro, Georgia\u2014were completed seven years behind schedule and cost more than twice as much as expected.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Georgia Power Co. </small></p><p>That included a mandated change in the NRC\u2019s mission statement, setting a goal of \u201cenabling the safe and secure use and deployment of civilian nuclear energy technologies\u201d. It was a symbol of Congress\u2019s intent to encourage the commission to support nuclear development.</p><p>In May President Trump built on that legislation with <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/9-key-takeaways-president-trumps-executive-orders-nuclear-energy\" target=\"_blank\">four executive orders</a> intended to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/doe-advanced-nuclear-site-permit\" target=\"_self\">speed up reactor licensing</a> and accelerate nuclear development\u2014a framework that has yet to be tested in practice. In November the NRC published <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/11/26/2025-21305/streamlining-select-rules-of-practice-and-procedure\" target=\"_blank\">regulations</a> setting out how it planned to implement the president\u2019s orders. The changes are focused on removing redundant and duplicative rules.</p><p>One of Trump\u2019s orders included a series of provisions intended to help build the U.S. nuclear workforce, but it\u2019s clear that that will be a challenge. The momentum gained in training skilled workers during the construction at Vogtle is already dissipating. Without other active new reactor projects to move on to immediately in the United States, many of the people who worked there have likely gone into other sectors, such as liquified natural gas (LNG) plants.</p><p>Around the time that construction was wrapping up at Vogtle, many employers in the industry were already reporting difficulties in finding the staff they need, according to the Department of Energy\u2019s 2025 <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/policy/us-energy-employment-jobs-report-useer\" target=\"_blank\">United States Energy and Employment Report</a>. Surveyed in 2024, 22 percent of employers in nuclear construction said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to hire the workers they needed, and 63 percent said it was \u201csomewhat difficult\u201d. In nuclear manufacturing, 63 percent of employers said hiring was \u201cvery difficult\u201d.</p><p>If reactor construction really begins to pick up, there is clearly a danger that those numbers will rise. </p><h2>U.S. Nuclear Power Expansion Plans</h2><p>So just how many reactors will $80 billion buy? Assuming an average of $16 billion per AP1000\u2014slightly less than for Vogtle, and allowing for cost reductions from economies of scale and learning-by-doing\u2014the plan would mean five new reactors. That would represent an increase of about 5.7 percent in total U.S. nuclear energy generation capacity, if all the reactors currently in service remain online.</p><p>The full details of the $80 billion deal, including the precise allocation of financing and risk-sharing, have not been specified. But Westinghouse\u2019s co-owner, Brookfield, did disclose that the partnership includes profit-sharing mechanisms that will give the U.S. government some of the upside if the initiative succeeds.</p><p>The <em><em>Washington Post</em></em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/28/nuclear-trump-japan-westinghouse/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that after the U.S. signs the final contracts for $80 billion worth of new reactors, it will be entitled to 20 percent of all Westinghouse\u2019s returns over $17.5 billion. And if Westinghouse\u2019s valuation surpasses $30 billion, the administration can require it to be floated on the stock market. If that happens, the government will get a 20 percent stake.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Deep pool of liquid containing two cylinder-shaped structures holding metal rods \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6872c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/deep-pool-of-liquid-containing-two-cylinder-shaped-structures-holding-metal-rods.jpg?id=62599130&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Enriched uranium is loaded at Vogtle Unit 4.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Georgia Power Co. </small></p><p>Japan\u2019s government is also playing a key role. As part of a <a href=\"https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/tariff_measures/houmon/pdf/250905oboegaki.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$550 billion U.S.-Japan trade deal</a> struck in July, the Japanese government pledged large-scale investment in U.S. energy, including nuclear. Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Group, and IHI Corp., are interested in investing up to $100 billion in the United States to support the construction of new AP1000s and small modular reactors (SMRs), the two governments said.</p><p>The Westinghouse deal supports a range of the administration\u2019s objectives, including power for AI and investment and job creation in the American industrial sector. The focus on AP1000s also makes it possible to rely on U.S.-produced fuel, strengthening energy security. (Many of the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-powered-data-center\" target=\"_self\">designs for SMRs</a>, which have garnered a considerable amount of excitement globally, use high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel, which is not currently produced on a large scale in the United States).</p><h2>U.S. Nuclear Energy Investment</h2><p>There have been other recent moves to add additional nuclear capacity in the United States. <a href=\"https://www.santeecooper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Santee Cooper</a>, a South Carolina utility, announced plans for completing the construction of two AP1000 reactors that had been abandoned in 2017 at the <a href=\"https://www.ans.org/news/2025-10-24/article-7493/santee-cooper-opts-to-reboot-summer-reactor-project/\" target=\"_blank\">V.C. Summer site in Jenkinsville, S.C</a>.</p><p>Separately, Google announced in October <a href=\"https://newsroom.nexteraenergy.com/NextEra-Energy-and-Google-Announce-New-Collaboration-to-Accelerate-Nuclear-Energy-Deployment-in-the-U-S?l=12\" target=\"_blank\">a deal with NextEra Energy</a> to reopen a 615-MW nuclear plant in Iowa. The Duane Arnold Energy Center was shut down in 2020, and the aim is to have it operational again by the first quarter of 2029. Google has agreed to buy a share of the plant\u2019s output for 25 years.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Industrial construction site with cranes, large windowless buildings and a domed structure.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9ad61\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/industrial-construction-site-with-cranes-large-windowless-buildings-and-a-domed-structure.jpg?id=62599135&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Construction of two AP1000 reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear site in Jenkinsville, S.C. were abandoned in 2017 after delays and cost overruns. Executives leading the projects were charged with fraud.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chuck Burton/AP </small></p><p>But the plans that have been announced so far pale in comparison to the Trump administration\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Earlier this year, Trump set a goal of adding a whopping <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/9-key-takeaways-president-trumps-executive-orders-nuclear-energy\" target=\"_blank\">300 gigawatts of nuclear capacity</a> by 2050, up from a little under 100 GW today. That would mean much stronger growth than is currently projected in Wood Mackenzie\u2019s forecasts, which show a near-doubling of U.S. nuclear generation capacity to about 190 GW in 2050.</p><p>The main driver behind the Trump administration\u2019s interest in nuclear is its ambitions for artificial intelligence. Chris Wright, the U.S. energy secretary, has described the race to develop advanced AI as the Manhattan Project of our times, critical to national security, and dependent upon a steep increase in electricity generation. Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-us-secretary-energy-chris-wright\" target=\"_blank\">Wright promised</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to make it easy to build power generation and data centers in our country.\u201d </p><p>One of the hallmarks of the Trump administration has been its readiness to intervene in markets to pursue its policy goals. Its nuclear strategy exemplifies that approach. In many ways, the Trump administration is acting like an energy company: using its financial strength and its convening power to put together a deal that covers the entire nuclear value chain. </p><p>Throughout the history of nuclear power, the industry has worked closely with governments. But the federal government effectively taking a commercial position in the development of new reactors would be a first for the United States. In the first wave of U.S. reactor construction in the 1970s, federal government support was limited to R&amp;D, uranium mining and enrichment, and indemnifying operators against the risk of nuclear accidents.</p><p>Before the partial deregulation of U.S. electricity markets that began in the 1990s, utilities could develop nuclear plants with the assurance that the costs could be recovered from customers, even if they went far over budget. With many key markets now at least partially deregulated, nuclear project developers will need other types of guarantees to secure financing and move forward.</p><p>The first new plants that result from the $80 billion deal will come online years after Trump has left office. But they could play an important role in boosting U.S. electricity supply and developing advanced AI for decades.</p>"

My primary worry was that iRobot would get swallowed up and effectively cease to exist, which tends to happen with acquisitions like these, but regulators in the United States had much more pointed concerns: namely, that Amazon would <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-jones-lawmakers-call-on-ftc-to-oppose-amazons-proposed-165-billion-acquisition-of-irobot\" target=\"_blank\">leverage its marketplace power to restrict competition</a>. The European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5990\" target=\"_blank\">expressed similar objections</a>.</p><p>By late January 2024, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-amazon\" target=\"_self\">the deal had fallen through</a>, iRobot laid off a third of its staff, suspended research and development, and CEO and cofounder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinangle/\" target=\"_blank\">Colin Angle</a> left the company. Since then, iRobot has seemed resigned to its fate, coasting along on a few lackluster product announcements and not much else, and so Sunday\u2019s announcement of bankruptcy was a surprise to no one\u2014perhaps least of all to Angle.</p><h2>iRobot\u2019s Bankruptcy and Amazon Deal Collapse</h2><p>\u201ciRobot\u2019s bankruptcy filing was really just a public-facing outcome of the tragedy that happened a year and a half ago,\u201d Angle told <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> on Monday. \u201cToday sucks, but I\u2019ve already mourned. I mourned when the deal with Amazon got blocked for all the wrong reasons.\u201d Angle points out that by the early 2020s, iRobot was no longer monopolizing the robot-vacuum market. This was especially true in Europe, where iRobot\u2019s market share was 12 percent and decreasing. But from Angle\u2019s perspective, regulators were more focused on making a point about Big Tech than they were about the actual merits and risks of the merger. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A suited man with short blonde hair and glasses holds a round black robot vacuum in a hallway covered in patents.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5ec16\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-suited-man-with-short-blonde-hair-and-glasses-holds-a-round-black-robot-vacuum-in-a-hallway-covered-in-patents.jpg?id=62593550&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cofounder Colin Angle says that iRobot\u2019s bankruptcy filing was unsurprising after a failed acquisition by Amazon a year and a half ago.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Charles Krupa/AP</small></p><p>\u201cWe were roadkilled in a larger agenda,\u201d Angle says. \u201cAnd this kind of regulation is incredibly destructive to the innovation economy. The whole concept of starting a tech company and having it acquired by a bigger tech company is far and away the most common positive outcome. For that to be taken away is not a good thing.\u201d And for iRobot, it was fatal. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268854\" target=\"_blank\">common criticism</a> of iRobot even before the attempted Amazon merger is that the company was simply being out-innovated in the robot-vacuum space, and Angle doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree. \u201cBy 2020, China had become the largest market in the world for robot vacuums, and Chinese robotics companies with government support were investing two or three times as much as iRobot was in R&amp;D. We simply didn\u2019t have the capital to move as quickly as we wanted to. In order for iRobot to continue to innovate and lead the industry, we needed to do so as part of a larger entity, and Amazon was very aligned with our vision for the home.\u201d</p><p>This situation is not unique to iRobot, and there is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm\" target=\"_blank\">significant concern in robotics</a><strong> </strong>about how companies can effectively compete against the massive advantage that China has in the production of low-cost hardware. In some sense, what happened to iRobot is an early symptom of what Angle (<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm\" target=\"_self\">and others</a>) see as a fundamental problem with robotics in the United States: lack of government support. In China, <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/11/embodied-ai-china-smart-robots\" target=\"_blank\">long-term government support for robotics and embodied AI</a> (in the form of both policy and direct investment)  can be found across industry and academia, something that neither the United States nor the European Union has been able to match. <span>\u201cRobotics is in a global competition against some very fearsome competitors,\u201d Angle says.</span><span> \u201c</span><span>We have to decide whether we want to support our innovation economy. And if the answer is no, then the innovation economy g</span><span>oes elsewhere.\u201d</span></p><p>The consequence of companies like iRobot losing this competition can be more than just bankruptcy. In iRobot\u2019s case, a Chinese company now owns iRobot\u2019s intellectual property and app infrastructure, which gives it access to data from millions of highly sensorized autonomous mobile robots in homes across the world. I asked Angle whether or not Roomba owners should be concerned about this. \u201cWhen I was running the company, we talked a lot about this, and put a lot of effort into privacy and security,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was fundamental to Roomba\u2019s design. Now, I can\u2019t speak to what they\u2019ll prioritize.\u201d</p><p>While Angle has moved on from iRobot, and has since cofounded a more-mysterious-than-we\u2019d-like company called <a href=\"https://www.familiarmachines.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Familiar Machines and Magic</a>, he still feels strongly that what has happened to iRobot should be a warning to both robotics companies and policymakers. \u201cMake no mistake: China is good at robots. So we need to play this hard. There\u2019s a lot to learn from what we did at iRobot, and a lot of ways to do it better.\u201d</p>On a personal note, I\u2019m choosing to remember the iRobot that was\u2014not just the company that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-roomba-history\" target=\"_self\">built a robot vacuum out of nothing</a> and conquered the world with it for nearly two decades, but also the company that built the <a href=\"https://robotsguide.com/robots/packbot\" target=\"_blank\">PackBot</a> to save lives, as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUd1miyCn5I\" target=\"_blank\">all of these other crazy robots</a>. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s ever been a company quite like iRobot, and there may never be again. It will be missed."

Entire cities lost electricity in the middle of the day. In the bustling airports of Madrid, Barcelona, and other key hubs, departure boards went blank. No power. No Internet. Even mobile phone service\u2014something most people take for granted\u2014was severely compromised. It was just disconnection and disruption. On the roads, traffic lights stopped functioning, snarling traffic and leaving people wondering when the power would return.</p><p>The size and scale of the impact were unsettling, but the scariest part was the speed at which it happened. Within minutes, the whole of the Iberian Peninsula\u2019s energy generation dropped from roughly 25GW to less than 1.2GW.</p><p> While this may sound like a freak accident, incidents like this will continue to happen, especially given the rapid changes to the electrical grid over the past few decades. Worldwide, power systems are evolving from large centralized generation to a multitude of diverse, distributed generation sources, representing a major paradigm shift. This is not merely a \u201cpower\u201d problem but is also a \u201csystems\u201d problem. It involves how all the parts of the power grid interact to maintain stability, and it requires a holistic solution.</p><p>Power grids are undergoing a massive transformation\u2014from coal- and gas-fired plants to millions of solar panels and wind turbines scattered across vast distances. It\u2019s not just a technology swap. It\u2019s a complete reimagining of how electricity is generated, transmitted, and used. And if we get it wrong, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for more catastrophic blackouts like the one that hit all of Spain and Portugal. The good news is that a solution developed by our group at <a href=\"https://www.iit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> over the last two decades and commercialized by our company, <a href=\"http://www.syndem.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Syndem</a>, has achieved global standardization and is moving into large-scale deployment. It\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.syndem.com/Products.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Synchronous Machines</a>, and it might be the key to keeping the lights on as we transition to a renewable future.</p><h2>Rapid Deployment of Renewable Energy</h2><p>The<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) created a <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Net Zero</a> by 2050 roadmap that calls for nearly 90% of global electricity generation to come from renewable, distributed sources, with <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/solar-pv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solar photovoltaic (PV</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/wind\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wind</a> accounting for almost 70%. We are witnessing firsthand a paradigm shift in power systems, moving from centralized to distributed generation.</p><p>The IEA projects that <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">renewable power installations will more than double between 2025 and 2030</a>, underscoring the urgent need to integrate renewables smoothly into existing power grids. A key technical nuance is that many distributed energy resources (DERs) produce direct current (DC) electricity, while the grid operates on alternating current (AC). To connect these resources to the grid, inverters convert DC into AC. To understand this further, we need to discuss inverter technologies.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An array of touch screens and Syndem converters in a control room.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3b7b2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-array-of-touch-screens-and-syndem-converters-in-a-control-room.jpg?id=62297380&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Professor Beibei Ren\u2019s team at Texas Tech University built modules for a SYNDEM test bed with 12 modules and a substation module, consisting of 108 converters. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Beibei Ren/Texas Tech University</small></p><p>Most of the inverters currently deployed in the field directly control the current (power) injected to the grid while constantly following the grid voltage, often referred to as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy-transition\" target=\"_blank\">grid-following inverters</a>. Therefore, this type of inverter is a current source, meaning that its current is controlled, but its terminal voltage is determined by what it connects to. Grid-following inverters rely on a stable grid to inject power from renewable sources and operate properly. This is not a problem when the grid is stable, but it becomes one when the grid is less stable. For instance, when the grid goes down or experiences severe disturbances, grid-following inverters typically trip off, meaning they don\u2019t provide support when the grid needs them most.</p><p>In recent years, attempts to address grid instability have led to the rise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-inverter\" target=\"_blank\">grid-forming inverters.</a> As the name suggests, these inverters could help form the grid. These usually refer to an inverter that controls its terminal voltage, including both the amplitude and frequency, which indirectly controls the current injected into the grid. This inverter behaves as a voltage source, meaning that its terminal voltage is regulated, but its current is determined by what it is connected to. Unlike grid-following inverters, grid-forming inverters can operate independently from the grid. This makes them useful in situations where the grid goes down or isn\u2019t available, such as during blackouts. They can also help balance supply and demand, support voltage, and even restart parts of the grid if it shuts down. </p><p>One issue is that the term \u201cgrid-forming\u201d means different things to different people. Some of them lack clear physical meaning or robust performance under complex grid conditions. Many grid-forming controls are model-based and may not scale properly in large systems. As a result, the design and control of these inverters can vary significantly. Grid-forming inverters made by different companies may not be interoperable, especially in large or complex power systems, which can include grid-scale battery systems, high-voltage DC (HVDC) links, solar PV panels, and wind turbines. The ambiguity of the term is increasingly becoming a barrier for grid-forming inverters, and no standards have been published yet.</p><h2>Systemic Challenges when Modernizing the Grid</h2><p>Let\u2019s zoom out for a moment to examine the broader landscape of structural challenges we need to address when transitioning today\u2019s grid into its future state. This transition is often called the <em><em>democratization of power systems</em></em>. Just as in politics, where democracy means everyone has a say, this transition in power systems means that every grid player can play a role. The primary difference between a political democracy and a power system is that the power system needs to maintain the stability of its frequency and voltage. If we apply a purely democratic approach to manage the power grid, it will sow the seeds for potential systemic failure.</p><p>The second systemic challenge is compatibility. The current power grid was designed long ago for a few big power plants\u2014not for millions of small, intermittent energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines. Ideally, we\u2019d build a whole new grid to fit today\u2019s needs, but that would bring too much disruption, cost too much, and take too long. The only feasible option is to somehow make various grid players compatible with the grid. To better conceptualize this, think about the invention of the modem, which solved the compatibility issues between computers and telephone systems, or the widespread adoption of USB ports. These inventions made many devices, such as cameras, printers, and phones, compatible with computers.</p><p>The third systemic challenge is scalability. It\u2019s one thing to hook up a few solar panels to the grid. It\u2019s entirely different to connect millions of them and still keep everything running safely and reliably. It\u2019s like walking one large dog versus walking hundreds of Chihuahuas at once. It is crucial for future power systems to adopt an architecture that can operate at different scales, allowing a power grid to break into smaller grids when needed or reconnect to operate as one grid, all autonomously. This is crucial to ensure resilience during extreme weather events, natural disasters, and/or grid faults.</p><p>To address these systemic challenges, the technologies need to undergo a seismic transformation. Today\u2019s power grids are electric-machine-based, with electricity generated by large synchronous machines in centralized facilities, often with slow dynamics. Tomorrow\u2019s grid will run on power electronic converters\u2014small, distributed, and with fast dynamics. It\u2019s a significant change, and one we need to plan carefully for.</p><h2>The Key is Synchronization</h2><p>Traditional fossil fuel power plants use synchronous machines to generate electricity, as they can inherently synchronize with each other or the grid when connected. In other words, they autonomously regulate their speeds and the grid frequency around a preset value, meeting a top requirement of power systems. This synchronization mechanism has underpinned the stable operation and organic expansion of power grids for over a century. So, preserving the synchronization mechanism in today\u2019s grids is crucial for addressing the systemic challenges as we transition from today\u2019s grid into the future.</p><p>Unlike traditional power plants, inverters are not inherently synchronous, but they need to be. The key enabling technology is called v<a href=\"http://www.syndem.com/Products.html\" target=\"_blank\">irtual synchronous machines</a> (VSMs). These are not actual machines, but instead are power electronic converters controlled through special software codes to behave like physical turbines. You can think of them as having the body of power converters with the brain of the older spinning synchronous machines. With VSMs, distributed energy resources can synchronize and support the grid, especially when something unexpected happens.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"clear box with a green circuit board and some copper coils.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ece07\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/clear-box-with-a-green-circuit-board-and-some-copper-coils.jpg?id=62297364&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Syndem\u2019s all-in-one reconfigurable and reprogrammable power electronic converter educational kit.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">SYNDEM</small></p><p>This naturally addresses the systemic challenges of compatibility and scalability. Like conventional synchronous machines, distributed energy resources are now compatible with the grid and can be integrated at any scale. But it gets better. First, inverters can be added to existing power systems without major hardware changes. Second, VSMs support the creation of small, local energy networks\u2014known as microgrids\u2014that can operate independently and reconnect to the main grid when needed. This flexibility is particularly useful during emergencies or power outages. Lastly, VSMs provide an elegant solution for the common concern about inertia, traditionally provided by large spinning machines that help cushion the grid against sudden changes. By design, VSMs can offer similar or even better characteristics of inertia.</p><p>VSMs are poised to become mainstream in the coming decade, driven in part by the backing of a global standard. After years of hard work, IEEE approved and published the first global standard on VSM, <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2988/10581/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Standard 2988-2024</a>. It involved members affiliated with key manufacturers, including <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">General Electric</a>, <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hitachienergy.com/us/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hitachi Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.se.com/us/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Schneider Electric</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eaton</a>, in addition to regulators and utilities, including <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</a> (NERC), <a href=\"https://www.misoenergy.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Midcontinent Independent System Operator</a> (MISO), <a href=\"https://www.nationalgridus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Grid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sce.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Southern California Edison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.duke-energy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Duke Energy Corporation</a>, and <a href=\"https://energinet.dk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Energinet</a>.</p><h2>The Holistic SYNDEM Architecture</h2><p>Until now, much of the expert discourse has focused primarily on energy generation. But that\u2019s only half of the equation\u2014the other half is demand: how different loads consume the electricity. Their behavior also plays a crucial role in maintaining grid stability, in particular when generation is powered by intermittent renewable energy sources.</p><p>There are many different loads, including motors, Internet devices, and lighting, among others. They are physically different, but technically have one thing in common: They will all have a rectifier at the front end because motor applications are more efficient with a motor drive, which consists of a rectifier; and Internet devices and LED lights consume DC electricity, which needs rectifiers at the front end as well. Like inverters, these rectifiers can also be controlled as VSMs, with the only difference being the direction of the power flow. Rectifiers consume electricity while inverters supply electricity.</p><p>As a result, most generation and consumption facilities in a future grid can be equipped and unified with the same synchronization mechanism to maintain grid stability in a <a href=\"https://resourcecenter.ieee-pels.org/education/webinars/pelsweb032018v#:~:text=Qing%2DChang%20Zhong&amp;text=Power%20systems%20are%20going%20through,syndem.com%20for%20more%20details.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">synchronized-and-democratized</a> (SYNDEM) manner. Yes, you read that correctly. Even devices that use electricity\u2014like motors, computers, and LED lights\u2014can play a similar active role in regulating the grid by autonomously adjusting their power demand according to instantaneous grid conditions. A less critical load can adapt its power demand by a larger percentage as needed, even up to 100%. In comparison, a more critical load can adjust its power demand at a smaller percentage or maintain its power demand. As a result, the power balance in a SYNDEM grid no longer depends predominantly on adjusting the supply but on dynamically adjusting both the supply and the demand, making it easier to maintain grid stability with intermittent renewable energy sources.</p><p>For many loads, it is often not a problem to adjust their demand by 5-10% for a short period. Cumulatively, this offers significant support for the grid. Due to the rapid response of VSM, the support provided by such loads is equivalent to inertia and/or spinning reserve\u2014extra power from synchronized generators not at full load. This can reduce the need for large spinning reserves that are currently necessary in power systems and reduce the effort to coordinate generation facilities. It also mitigates the impact of dwindling inertia caused by the retirement of conventional large generating facilities.</p><p>In a SYNDEM grid, all active grid players, regardless of size, whether conventional or renewable, supplying or consuming, would follow the same SYNDEM rule of law and play the same equal role in maintaining grid stability, democratizing power systems, and paving the way for autonomous operation. It is worth highlighting that the autonomous operation can be achieved without relying on communication networks or human intervention, lowering costs and improving security.</p><p>The SYNDEM architecture takes VSMs to new heights, addressing all three systemic challenges mentioned above: democratization, compatibility, and scalability. With this architecture, you can stack grids at different scales, much like building blocks. Each home grid can be operated on its own, multiple home grids can be connected to form a neighborhood grid, and multiple neighborhood grids can be connected to create a community grid, and so on. Moreover, such a grid can be decomposed into smaller grids when needed and can reconnect to form a single grid, all autonomously, without changing codes or issuing commands.</p> The holistic theory is established, the enabling technologies are in place, and the governing standard is approved. However, the full realization of VSMs within the SYNDEM architecture depends on joint ventures and global deployment. This isn\u2019t a task for any one group alone. We must act together. Whether you\u2019re a policymaker, innovator, investor, or simply someone who cares about keeping the lights on, you can play a role. Join us to make power systems worldwide stable, reliable, sustainable, and, eventually, fully autonomous."

A large black quadcopter drone, more than two meters spanning the propeller tips, sat parked on the grass. Nestled between the legs of its landing gear was a red balloon filled with water. Not far away, on a concrete pad, a stack of wood pallets was ablaze, the flames whipping around in a heavy wind. A student at the University of Maryland (UMD) would fly the <a href=\"https://freeflysystems.com/alta-x\" target=\"_blank\">Alta X</a> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/drones-sensors-wildfire-detection\" target=\"_self\">drone</a> all of about 25 meters to the fire.

As a second, smaller drone outfitted with a thermal camera surveyed the scene from above, Rivas maneuvered the balloon-laden drone to the proper position. After about a half minute, he released the water bomb...and the balloon plummeted to the ground just wide of the platform, bursting with a <em><em>thwaaaap</em></em>.</p><p>On this warm but blustery day in mid-October, a team of about 20 UMD students and professors were gathered at a fire and rescue training center in La Plata, Md., to demonstrate the building blocks of what could be the future of wildfire fighting. They called their team <a href=\"https://crossfire.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossfire</a>. Their guests were a handful of officials from the <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/\" target=\"_blank\">XPrize Foundation</a>, which has organized a pair of competitions to vastly speed up <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/competitions/wildfire\" target=\"_blank\">wildfire detection and suppression</a>. Twelve other teams are competing with Crossfire in the semifinals for the autonomous wildfire-suppression track of the competition. In the final round, to be held in June 2026, five of those teams will have to find a fire within 1,000 square kilometers of what XPrize calls \u201cenvironmentally challenging\u201d terrain and then navigate to and extinguish it, all within 10 minutes. The winner collects a US $3.5 million purse\u2014and, hopefully, the world\u2019s wildfire-fighting armies get a powerful new weapon for their arsenals.</p><h2>The Wildfire Problem<br /></h2><p>Wildfires are growing more severe and affecting more people worldwide. The November 2018 Camp Fire that burned down 620 square kilometers of Northern California, including most of the town of Paradise, was the most deadly and destructive in the state\u2019s recorded history, and it sent <a href=\"https://www.pge.com/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Gas and Electric</a>, the giant utility <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article230445554.html\" target=\"_blank\">responsible</a> for starting <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-an-australian-state-faced-devastation-from-gridsparked-wildfires\" target=\"_self\">the fire</a>, into bankruptcy. XPrize had long been based in the Los Angeles area, so that catastrophe was undoubtedly on the minds of its staffers when they formulated the competition in 2019. \u201cThis was just something that was really personal and close to a lot of the individuals at the organization,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/people/andrea-santy\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Santy</a>, program director for the wildfire competition. XPrize eventually organized a separate track of the competition to award $3.5 million for detecting small fires with satellites.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman in a blue jacket and red hat seen from behind.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3f6e3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-in-a-blue-jacket-and-red-hat-seen-from-behind.jpg?id=62599503&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Andrea Santy, one of the program managers from XPrize in charge of the wildfire competition, looks on during Crossfire\u2019s trials.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>Santy says XPrize\u2019s competition designers met with more than 100 experts in the field, including fire scientists, agency officials, and technologists\u2014\u201call the experts that you would want at the table were at the table.\u201d Where their views aligned, Santy says, XPrize researchers detected the \u201ccore problems.\u201d One of the most important was response time. In the best case, an hour can often pass between when a fire is first detected and when it\u2019s extinguished. XPrize aims to shrink that drastically. An additional $1 million will go to the teams that (per the rules) \u201csuccessfully demonstrate accurate, precise, and rapid detection.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://fpe.umd.edu/clark/faculty/601/Arnaud-Trouv%C3%A9\" target=\"_blank\">Arnaud Trouv\u00e9</a>, chair of the UMD\u2019s Fire Protection Engineering department, thinks even the 10-minute limit may not be good enough. \u201cOn a <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mqt/redflagtips\" target=\"_blank\">red flag</a> day with high-wind conditions, a fire that starts is going to be taking a big size within a matter of tens of seconds,\u201d he said as we waited for the Alta X to try again. \u201cSo even the 10 minutes you have to go do something will be too slow.\u201d Whatever comes from the XPrize, he says, will be adopted, but more likely in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00141-z\" target=\"_blank\">developed areas</a>, where fires spread more slowly and could be extinguished early on, when firefighters are often busy evacuating residents.</p><p>In any event, the time limit pointed most teams\u2014and all the teams to make the semifinals\u2014toward drones. Firefighters have worked, or tried to work, given bureaucratic and other hurdles, with drones for years, but mainly for reconnaissance, says <a href=\"https://wfca.com/staff/bob-roper/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Roper</a>, a senior wildfire advisor for the <a href=\"https://wfca.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Western Fire Chiefs Association</a>. Many of the hurdles around using drones have been cleared, but no drone exists yet that can carry enough suppressant to be useful on its own, says Roper. (The <a href=\"https://www.helicopterexpress.com/blog/how-much-water-can-a-helicopter-carry#:~:text=The%20standard%20Bambi%20Bucket%2C%20the,2%2C600%20gallons%20(9%2C840%20liters).&amp;text=The%20Bambi%20MAX%20Bucket%20developed,US%20gallons%20(9%2C800%20liters).&amp;text=Bambi%20Torrentula%20Bucket%2C%20introduced%20in,flexible%20and%20efficient%20firefighting%20operations\" target=\"_blank\">smallest helicopter bucket</a> carries 270 liters.)

How teams get to the fire has been driven by regulation\u2014the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap11_section_3.html\" target=\"_blank\">FAA has restrictions on drones weighing more than</a> 25 kilograms (55 pounds), as well as autonomous systems dropping payloads, which is why Rivas had to pilot the Alta X. \u201cSome are looking at how we can address the problem within the current regulations, so they\u2019re trying to stay within the 55 pounds,\u201d says Santy. Others are designing systems that ultimately could be deployed only under new regulations. That primarily comes down to either using a swarm of smaller drones or one heavy-lift drone. Teams that fly heavy in the finals will have to get FAA approval for the contest, just as Crossfire would need it to operate the Alta X autonomously.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A black quadcopter drone flies with a red balloon beneath it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b225c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-quadcopter-drone-flies-with-a-red-balloon-beneath-it.jpg?id=62601815&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Crossfire\u2019s fire-suppression drone flies toward a fire carrying a balloon full of water. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>Curiously, the XPrize appears not to have spurred much innovation in actually putting out a fire.

The balloon didn\u2019t completely burst until it hit the platform, spraying water all over and creating a huge puff of steam. But when the smoke cleared, the fire still burned. Crossfire\u2019s detonators, it turned out, were rated for warmer weather than this October day. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested this probably 20 different times, and 20 different times it\u2019s been successful,\u201d Alvarez said ruefully.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Crossfire\u2019s drone carries a water balloon skyward, finds the fire, and drops the balloon.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>But the third attempt, several hours later, was the charm.

Along with Taha, aerospace engineering professor <a href=\"https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/58/Derek-A-Paley\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Paley</a> has talked to some 40 potential customers\u2014mainly fire departments and government agencies\u2014for the system Crossfire is developing. He\u2019s currently uncertain whether there are enough organizations willing to adopt the technology to make it commercially viable. So far, he says, \u201cit\u2019s a little bit of an uphill battle, but we\u2019re hoping with the visibility brought to the problem by XPrize\u201d and the momentum of being a finalist\u2014and, better still, some prize money in hand\u2014\u201cwe\u2019ll have enough to have a compelling business model.\u201d</p><p>Roper, of the Western Fire Chiefs Association, acknowledges that \u201cpolitical considerations\u201d around existing fleets of crewed aircraft will challenge the transition to drones, but he says that these can gain a foothold by operating when and where crewed aircraft can\u2019t, at night, for example. Still, it will take multiple companies commercializing the technology to prod fire departments to purchase drones. Even then, he says, \u201cit\u2019s probably going to have to be adopted either at the federal or the state level first and then there\u2019s a trickle-down effect to the local fire departments.\u201d</p><p>If not, Paley says, \u201cour tech is applicable to law enforcement, and other aspects of public safety.

The lengthy process involves system planning, permit requests, and regulatory approvals. Only about 5 percent of new projects are approved each year, he says, in part because of grid reliability issues.</p><p>The interconnection technique takes about half the time, he says, bringing cleaner energy online faster. By overcoming interconnection bottlenecks, such as major transmission upgrades that delay renewable projects, the process speeds up project timelines and lowers expenses.</p><h3>Power Engineers Are In Short Supply</h3><br /><p>If you want to work in a secure, recession-proof industry, consider a career in power engineering, Kopzhanov says\u2014especially in an unstable job market, when even <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a>, and other large companies are laying off thousands of engineers.</p><p>The power industry desperately needs engineers. The global power sector will require between 450,000 and 1.5 million more engineers by 2030 to build, implement, and operate energy infrastructure, according to an <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">article</a> based on a <a href=\"https://ieee-pes.org/climate-change/2025-ieee-pes-workforce-development-report/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> conducted this year of the power engineering workforce by the <a href=\"https://ieee-pes.org/climate-change/2025-ieee-pes-workforce-development-report/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Power & Energy Society</a>.</p><p>One of the reasons for the shortage, Kopzhanov says, is that the power sector doesn\u2019t seem exciting to young engineers.</p><p>\u201cIt has not been popular because the technologies we\u2019re implementing nowadays were invented quite a long time ago,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there were not too many recent innovations.\u201d</p><p>But with new technologies being introduced, such as the generator replacement interconnection process, now is a great time to get into the industry, he says.</p><p>\u201cWe are facing lots of different kinds of interesting and big challenges, and we definitely need power engineers who can solve them, such as the supply and demand situation facing us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need right-minded people who can deal with that.</p><p>\u201cUntil this point, the marvelous engineering systems that have been designed and built with close to 100-percent reliability are not going to be the case moving forward, so we have to come up with innovative approaches.\u201d</p><p>Just because you have a power engineering degree, however, doesn\u2019t mean you have to work as a power engineer, he says.</p><p>\u201cMost students might assume they will have to dedicate themselves to only being a power engineer for the rest of their life\u2014which is not the case,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be on the business side or be an asset manager like me.</p><p>\u201cThe power sector is an extremely dynamic and vast area.

The first 460 MW of capacity is expected to be operational soon.</span></p><p>Another new project, developed with Middle River, is a battery system installed in April at California\u2019s <a href=\"https://svcleanenergy.org/news/battery-project-supports-reliability-and-reduces-emissions/\" target=\"_blank\">Hanford Hybrid Energy Center</a>, a natural gas reliability facility. It used existing and incremental interconnection capacity to add the storage system. The surplus renewable energy from the batteries will be used during peak times to reduce the plant\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a <a href=\"https://svcleanenergy.org/news/battery-project-supports-reliability-and-reduces-emissions/\" target=\"_blank\">Silicon Valley Clean Energy article</a> about the installation.</p><p>\u201cThese projects are uniquely positioned to be colocated with existing power plants,\u201d Kopzhanov says. \u201cBut, at the same time, they are renewable and sustainable sources of power\u2014which is also helping to decarbonize the environment and meet the emission-reduction goals of the state.\u201d</p><h2>Influenced by Kazakhstan\u2019s power industry</h2><p>Born and raised in Taraz, Kazakhstan, Kopzhanov was surrounded by relatives who worked in the power industry. It\u2019s not surprising that he has pursued a career in the field.</p><p>Until 1991, when the country was still a Soviet republic, most Kazakhs were required to help build the country\u2019s power and transmission systems, he says. His mother and father are chemical engineers, and his grandfather was involved in the power industry. They told him about how they designed the transformers and overhead power lines. From a young age, he knew he wanted to be an engineer too, he says.</p><p>Today the Central Asian country is a major producer of oil, gas, and coal.</p><p>Kopzhanov left Kazakhstan in 2008 to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at <a href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Purdue University</a>, in West Lafayette, Ind.</p><p>After graduating in 2012, he was hired as an electrical design engineer by <a href=\"https://www.fluor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fluor Corp</a>. in Farnborough, England. He oversaw the development of a master plan for a power project there. He also engineered and designed high-voltage switchgears, substations, and transformers.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cEvery power plant has its own interconnection rights but, amazingly, most are not fully utilizing them.\u201d</span></p><p>In 2015 he joined <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ExxonMobil</a> in Houston, working as a project manager. During his six years there, he held managerial positions. Eventually, he was promoted to asset advisor and was responsible for evaluating the feasibility of investing in decarbonization and electrification projects by identifying their risks and opportunities.</p><p>He decided he wanted to learn more about the business aspects of running a company, so he left in 2021 to pursue an MBA at <a href=\"https://poetsandquants.com/2021/12/08/meet-the-mba-class-of-2023-talgat-kopzhanov-indiana-university-kelley/\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business</a>, in Bloomington. During his MBA program, he briefly worked as a consultant for a lithium-ion manufacturing firm, offering advice on the viability of their proposed projects and investments.</p><p>\u201cEngineers aren\u2019t typically connected to the business world,\u201d he says, \u201cbut having an understanding of what the needs are and tailoring your future goals toward that is extremely important. In my view, that\u2019s how you\u2019ll become a great technical expert. I definitely recommend that engineers have some kind of understanding of the business side.\u201d</p><p>He joined Middle River shortly after graduating from Indiana with his MBA in 2023.</p><h2>The power of membership</h2><p>Kopzhanov was introduced to IEEE by a colleague at ExxonMobil after he asked the member about an IEEE plaque displayed on his desk.

It also aimed to train 110,000 workers over five years.

SMART is a public-private partnership operated by SRC Manufacturing Consortium Corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the <a href=\"https://www.src.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)</a>. Established in 1982, and backed by the semiconductor industry, SRC funds R&amp;D at universities and has sponsored more than 15,000 students. </p><p>According to an email dated 12 December,  sent to SMART USA participants, and obtained by <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, Commerce notified the organization of the termination on 10 December. The funds were withdrawn \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nasbp.org/post/the-government-contractors-guide-to-termination-for-convenience/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">for convenience</a>,\u201d an option that allows the government to unilaterally withdraw from an agreement that is written into many federal contracts, the email states. Requests for comment from the Commerce Department were not returned by press time.</p><p>\u201cAlthough DOC acknowledged that we built an effective organization and met all performance targets, the administration has chosen not to support R&amp;D and workforce development in this direction,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddyounkin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Younkin</a>, SMART USA\u2019s executive director and the CEO of SRC, wrote in the email.</p><h2>What Comes Next?</h2><p>Details of what happens next are still coming, but Younkin wrote that the organization would hold a Q&amp;A webinar on Wednesday 17 December to answer member questions.</p><p>\u201cWhile this is a setback, it doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of the work or the strength of our shared commitment to advancing leadership in microelectronics and advanced packaging,\u201d he wrote in the email. He added that SRC will continue to fund research through its other programs.</p><p>In response to <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>\u2019s questions, Younkin\u2019s office confirmed that the email was genuine. <strong></strong></p><p>Younkin reiterated that SMART USA had met its performance targets, and that the organization\u2019s performance was not the reason for the move. The organization added that it is \u201ccoordinating a responsible transition with [the Commerce Department] and members.\u201d</p><p>Regarding SRC, Younkin stated: \u201cWhile this transition is challenging, it does not define our future. We have united the semiconductor community for decades, and will continue to do so. SRC will continue to drive industry-led innovation, fostering strong ecosystems and collaborations. That includes empowerment of the next generation of semiconductor professionals, who must deliver the next era of compute and communications. Together, we will turn this moment into momentum.\u201d </p><p>In a statement, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-henshall-8a21497\" target=\"_blank\">David N. Henshall</a>, chief operations officer for SMART USA, and senior vice-president for SRC, said: \u201cFederal contracting decisions evolve over time, and \u2018termination for convenience\u2019 is an established mechanism in those agreements and is not a reflection of the significant work we were doing. What\u2019s clear is the industry\u2019s continued need: the challenges in microelectronics and advanced packaging remain, and SRC\u2019s programs provide a durable path forward for collaborative R&amp;D and talent.\u201d</p><p> <cite class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cNIST has a reputation as a neutral and steadfast partner that can work with any industry and academic organization. This reputation is very much at risk\u201d</cite><span>\u2014Zoe Lofgren and Haley Stevens, House of Representatives Committee on Science Space, and Technology</span></p><p>The addition of SMART USA to SRC\u2019s portfolio led to some disruption, according to an academic participant who did not wish to be named. This scientist\u2019s three-year, $450,000 proposal had been accepted for funding in 2025, 2026, and 2027 under <a href=\"https://www.src.org/program/grc/about/mission/\" target=\"_blank\">SRC\u2019s Global Research Collaboration</a> program. But, early in 2025, years two and three of the grant were canceled and the scientist was invited to apply to SMART USA instead. </p><p>The new program required expanding the scope of the project, boosting the number of academic participants, and seeking participation and funding from SMART USA members. He joined up with researchers from eight other universities and a chipmaking equipment firm, then spent the summer writing a new proposal and trying to get SMART USA industry members on board. By August, \u201cwe were not able to secure enough funding commitments from SMART USA members to even submit,\u201d he said, adding that many of the SRC member companies that the group had been working with had not joined SMART USA by the time of submission, and those that had seemed to be putting in very little cash into the effort.</p><h2>Commerce vs. the CHIPS Act</h2><p>The withdrawal of funding from SMART USA echoes an earlier move that withdrew $7.4 billion from Natcast, the public-private partnership set up to run the National Semiconductor Technology Center, the CHIPS Act\u2019s main R&amp;D effort.</p><p>However, the two events are starkly different in tone and publicity. Commerce has so far made no public statement about SMART USA. But in a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Natcast-CEO-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">public letter</a> announcing the withdrawal of funds from Natcast, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick implied impropriety on the part of organization, its CEO\u2014<a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipient/deirdre-hanford/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Frederik Philips Award</a> winner Dierdre Hanford\u2014and other experts involved in its creation. Within weeks, Natcast was forced to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/natcast-layoffs\" target=\"_self\">lay off the majority of its staff</a> and has now folded. </p><p>In a <a href=\"https://democrats-science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2025-12-17_HSST_Letter_Lofgren-Stevens_SmartUSA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter to Craig Burkhardt</a>, Acting Undersecretary of Commerce for standards and technology, date 17 December, two members of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology questioned the move to defund SMART USA. </p><p>California Democrat <a href=\"https://lofgren.house.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Zoe Lofgren</a> and Michigan Democrat <a href=\"https://stevens.house.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Haley Stevens</a> \u201cquestion the Department\u2019s recent decisions to halt or delay semiconductor research and development (R&amp;D) programs and awards authorized by Congress, and break existing obligations to industry and academia.\u201d</p><p>The lawmakers worry that these moves cause long term harm to the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Science and Technology</a> (NIST), the agency within Commerce that implements the CHIPS Act. \u201cNIST has a reputation as a neutral and steadfast partner that can work with any industry and academic organization,\u201d they write. \u201cThis reputation is very much at risk. Few companies would willingly seek partnership with an organization that cancels its obligation on a whim.\u201d </p><p>The letter then went on to criticize NIST\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/chips/r%2526d-funding-opportunities/crdo-broad-agency-announcement-baa\" target=\"_blank\">solicitation of R&amp;D proposals</a> made in September in the wake of the destruction of Natcast. \u201cNIST seems to have pivoted its model to that of an investment accelerator or venture capital fund, funding riskier research in exchange for intellectual property and equity,\u201d they write. \u201cWhile there is a time and place for the venture capital model, especially in the private sector, dedicating the entire CHIPS R&amp;D program to it would unquestionably fail to meet the clear text and intent of the CHIPS Act.\u201d</p>"

In fact, scientists have been working toward that goal since <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-topsy-turvy-world-of-quantum-computing\" target=\"_self\">at least the 1980s</a>, and it has proved difficult, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cIf someone says quantum computers are commercially useful today, I say I want to have what they\u2019re having,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvalboger/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yuval Boger</a>, chief commercial officer of the quantum-computing startup <a href=\"https://www.quera.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">QuEra</a>,<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvalboger/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>on stage at the<a href=\"https://iqtevent.com/quantumai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Q+AI</a> conference in New York City in October.</p><p>Because the goal is so lofty, tracking its progress has also been difficult. To help chart a course toward truly transformative quantum technology and mark milestones along the path, the team at <a href=\"https://quantum.microsoft.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Quantum</a> has come up with a new <a href=\"https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/insights/blogs/qsharp/defining-logical-qubits-criteria-for-resilient-quantum-computation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">framework</a>.</p><p>This framework lays out three levels of quantum-computing progress. The first level includes the kinds of machines we have today: the so-called noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. These computers are made up of roughly 1,000 quantum bits, or qubits, but are noisy and error prone. The second level consists of small machines that implement<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-error-correction\" target=\"_self\"> </a>one of many protocols that can robustly <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-error-correction\" target=\"_self\">detect and correct qubit errors</a>. The third and final level represents a large-scale version of those error-corrected machines, containing hundreds of thousands or even millions of qubits and capable of millions of quantum operations, with high fidelity.</p><p>If you accept this framework, 2026 is slated to be the year when customers can finally get their hands on level-two quantum computers. \u201cWe feel very excited about the year 2026, because lots of work that happened over the last so many years is coming to fruition now,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivas-prasad-suga-77b2ab5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Srinivas Prasad Sugasani</a>, vice president of quantum at Microsoft.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"quantum\">Microsoft, in collaboration with the startup <a href=\"https://atom-computing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Atom Computing</a>, plans to<a href=\"https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/news/eifo-and-the-novo-nordisk-foundation-acquire-the-worlds-most-powerful-quantum-computer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> deliver</a> an error-corrected quantum computer to the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark and the <a href=\"https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Novo Nordisk Foundation</a>. \u201cThis machine should be utilized toward establishing a scientific advantage\u2014not a commercial advantage yet, but that\u2019s the path forward,\u201d Sugasani says.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.quera.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">QuEra</a> has also <a href=\"https://www.quera.com/press-releases/aist-selects-quera0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">delivered</a> a quantum machine ready for error correction to Japan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)</a>, and plans to make it available to global customers in 2026.</p><h2>The significance of error correction</h2><p>Arguably, the main trouble with today\u2019s quantum computers is their propensity for noise. Quantum bits are inherently fragile and thus sensitive to all kinds of environmental factors, such as electric or magnetic fields, mechanical vibrations, or even cosmic rays. Some have argued that even noisy quantum machines can be useful, but almost everyone agrees that for truly transformative applications, quantum computers will need to become error resilient.</p><p>To make classical information robust against errors, one can simply repeat it. Say you want to send a 0 bit along a noisy channel. That 0 might get flipped to a 1 along the way, causing a miscommunication. But if you instead send three zeros in a row, it will still be obvious that you were trying to send a 0 even if one gets flipped.</p><p>Simple repetition does not work with qubits, because they cannot be copied and pasted. But there are still ways to encode the information contained in a single qubit onto many physical qubits, making it more resilient. These groups of physical qubits encoding one qubit\u2019s worth of information are known as logical qubits. Once information is encoded in these logical qubits, as the computation proceeds and errors occur, error-correction algorithms can then tease apart what mistakes were made and what the original information was.</p><p>Just creating these logical qubits is not enough\u2014it\u2019s important to experimentally verify that encoding information in logical qubits leads to lower error rates and better computation. Back in 2023, the team at QuEra, in collaboration with researchers at Harvard, MIT, and the University of Maryland, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06927-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">showed</a> that quantum operations carried out with logical qubits outperformed those done with bare physical qubits. The Microsoft and Atom Computing team <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2411.11822v1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">managed the same feat</a> in 2024.</p><p>This year, these scientific advances will reach customers. The machine that Microsoft and Atom Computing will be delivering, called Magne, will have 50 logical qubits, built from some 1,200 physical qubits, and should be operational by the start of 2027. QuEra\u2019s machine at AIST has around 37 logical qubits (depending on implementation) and 260 physical qubits, Boger says.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"neutral\">Quantum computers made of atoms</h2><p>It may be no coincidence that both of the level-two quantum computers will be built out of the same types of qubits: neutral atoms. While the classical computing world has long since settled on the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/invention-of-the-transistor\" target=\"_self\">transistor</a> as the fundamental device of choice, the quantum-computing world has yet to pick the perfect qubit, be it a superconductor (pursued at <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/quantum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a>, <a href=\"https://quantumai.google/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, and others), a photon (used by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.psiquantum.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PsiQuantum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xanadu.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xanadu</a>), an ion (developed by <a href=\"https://ionq.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IonQ</a> and <a href=\"https://www.quantinuum.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=16455839979&amp;utm_content=585537331104&amp;utm_term=quantum%20computing&amp;matchtype=b&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;loc_physical_ms=9207015&amp;loc_interest_ms=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=16455839979&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoc8oL3Uw1XoLHVdoWkNjPpv_50QI&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAoNbIBhB5EiwAZFbYGPm7HANc0Z-8-8AsuB4d5Cb4bR1Nlfoq1RyE_n369Wa45upR8lhPBxoCrxsQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Quantinuum</a>, to name a few), or other.</p><p>All of these options have their advantages and disadvantages, but there is a reason some of the earliest error-corrected machines are built with neutral atoms. The physical qubits that make up a logical qubit need to be close to each other, or connected in some way, in order to share information. Unlike, say, superconducting qubits printed on a chip, any two atomic qubits can be brought right next to each other (an advantage shared by <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/05/1127659/a-new-ion-based-quantum-computer-makes-error-correction-simpler/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">trapped ions</a>).</p><p>\u201cNeutral atoms can be moved around,\u201d says QuEra\u2019s Boger. \u201cThat allows us to build error-correction methods that are just not possible with static qubits.\u201d</p><p>A neutral-atom quantum computer consists of a vacuum chamber. Inside the chamber, a gas of atoms is cooled to just above absolute zero. Then, individual atoms are captured, held, and even moved around by tightly focused laser beams in a technique known as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-tweezers-can-now-manipulate-matter-on-a-nanoscale\" target=\"_blank\">optical tweezing</a>. Each atom is a single physical qubit, and these qubits can be arranged in a 2D or even 3D array.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of scientific optical equipment with colorful reflections and intricate components.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"27240\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-scientific-optical-equipment-with-colorful-reflections-and-intricate-components.jpg?id=62604110&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Neutral-atom quantum computers consist of individual atoms that are manipulated and controlled primarily by lasers.

Computations on atomic systems are about one-hundredth to one-thousandth as fast as their superconducting counterparts, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerrymchow/\" target=\"_blank\">Jerry Chow</a>, director of quantum systems at IBM Quantum.</p><p>However, Boger argues that this slowdown can be compensated for. \u201cBecause of the unique capabilities of neutral atoms, we have shown that we can create a 50x or 100x speedup over what previously was thought,\u201d he says, referring to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09543-5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent work</a> at QuEra in collaboration with Harvard and Yale. \u201cWe think that when you compare what some people call time to solution, not just clock speed but how long it would take you to get to that useful result\u2026that neutral atoms today are comparable to superconducting qubits.\u201d Even though each operation is slow, more operations are done in parallel and fewer operations are needed for error correction, allowing for the speedup.</p><h2>More than one way to skin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat </h2><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"level\">Microsoft\u2019s three-level framing is not accepted by everyone in the industry.</p><p>\u201cI think that kind of level framing\u2026is a very physics-device-oriented view of the world, and we should be looking at it more from a computational view of the world, which is, what can you actually use these circuits for and enable?\u201d says IBM\u2019s Chow.</p><p>Chow argues that, although a large error-corrected machine is the ultimate goal, it doesn\u2019t mean error correction must be implemented first. Instead, the team at IBM is focusing on finding use cases for existing machines and using other error-suppressing strategies along the way, while also working toward a fully error-corrected machine in <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/roadmaps/quantum/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2029</a>.</p><p>Whether or not you accept the framing, the teams at QuEra, Microsoft, and Atom Computing are optimistic about the neutral-atom approach\u2019s potential to reach large-scale devices. \u201cIf there\u2019s one word, it\u2019s scalability.

The phenomenon of cavitation\u2014the formation and collapse of tiny gas bubbles due to changes in pressure\u2014was considered an undesirable and largely uncontrollable side effect. But in 2001, researchers at the University of Michigan began exploring ways to harness the phenomenon for the destruction of cancerous tumors and other problematic tissue.</p><p>The trouble was, creating and controlling cavitation generated heat, which harmed healthy tissue beyond the target area. <a href=\"https://bme.umich.edu/people/xu-zhen/\" target=\"_blank\">Zhen Xu</a>, who was working on a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering at the time, was bombarding pig heart tissue in a tank of water with ultrasound when she made a breakthrough.</p><p>The key was using extremely powerful ultrasound to produce negative pressure of more than 20 megapascals, delivered in short bursts measured in microseconds\u2014but separated by relatively long gaps, between a millisecond and a full second long. These parameters created bubbles that quickly formed and collapsed, tearing apart nearby cells and turning the tissue into a kind of slurry, while avoiding heat buildup. The result was a form of incisionless surgery, a way to wipe out tumors without scalpels, radiation, or heat.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>\u201cThe experiments worked,\u201d says Xu, now a professor at Michigan, \u201cbut I also destroyed the ultrasound equipment that I used,\u201d which was the most powerful available at the time. In 2009, she cofounded a company, <a href=\"https://histosonics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HistoSonics</a>, to commercialize more powerful ultrasound machines, test treatment of a variety of diseases, and make the procedure, called histotripsy, widely available.</p><p>So far, the killer app is fighting <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cancer\" target=\"_blank\">cancer</a>. In 2023, HistoSonics\u2019 Edison system received FDA approval for <a href=\"https://histosonics.com/news/fda-awards-histosonics-clearance-of-its-first-of-a-kind-edison-histotripsy-system-2/\" target=\"_blank\">treatment of liver tumors</a>. In 2026, clinicians will conclude a <a href=\"https://histosonics.com/news/worlds-first-kidney-tumor-treated-using-the-histosonics-edison-histotripsy-system/\" target=\"_blank\">pivotal kidney cancer study</a> and apply for regulatory approval. They\u2019ll also launch a large-scale pivotal trial for pancreatic cancer, considered one of the deadliest forms of the disease with a five-year survival rate of just <a href=\"https://pancan.org/press-releases/pancreatic-cancer-diagnoses-and-mortality-rates-climb-five-year-survival-rate-for-pancreatic-cancer-stalls-at-13/\" target=\"_blank\">13 percent</a>. An effective treatment for pancreatic cancer would represent a major advance against one of the most lethal malignancies.</p><h2>Histotripsy\u2019s Benefits for Cancer Treatment</h2><p>HistoSonics is not the only developer of histotripsy devices or techniques, but it is first to market with a purpose-built device. \u201cWhat HistoSonics has developed is a symphony of technologies, which combines physics, biology, and biomedical engineering,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.cc.nih.gov/meet-our-doctors/bwood\" target=\"_blank\">Bradford Wood</a>, an interventional radiologist at the National Institutes of Health, who is not affiliated with the company. Its engineering effort has spanned multiple disciplines to produce robotic, computer-guided systems that turn physical forces into therapeutic effects.</p><p>Over the past decade, research has confirmed or found other benefits of histotripsy. With precise calibration, fibrous tissue\u2014such as blood vessels\u2014can be spared from damage even in the target zone. And while other noninvasive techniques may leave scar tissue, the liquefied debris created by histotripsy is cleared away by the body\u2019s natural processes.</p><p>In HistoSonics\u2019 early trials for pancreatic cancer, doctors used focused ultrasound pulses to ablate, or destroy, tumors deep within the pancreas. \u201cIt\u2019s a great achievement for the entire field to show that it is possible to ablate pancreatic tumors and that it\u2019s well tolerated,\u201d says <a href=\"https://gastro.uw.edu/people/faculty/khokhlova-t\" target=\"_blank\">Tatiana Khokhlova</a>, a medical ultrasound researcher at the University of Washington, in Seattle, who has worked on alternative histotripsy techniques.</p><p>Khokhlova says the key to harnessing histotripsy\u2019s benefits \u201cwill be combining ablation of the primary tumor in the pancreas with some other therapy.\u201d Combination treatment could fight recurrent cancer and tiny tumors that ultrasound might miss, while also tapping into a surprising benefit.</p><p>Histotripsy generally seems to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31940590/\" target=\"_blank\">stimulate an immune response</a>, helping the body attack cancer cells that weren\u2019t targeted directly by ultrasound. The mechanical destruction of tumors likely leaves behind recognizable traces of cancer proteins that help the immune system learn to identify and destroy similar cells elsewhere in the body, explains Wood. Researchers are now exploring ways to pair histotripsy with immunotherapy to amplify that effect.</p><p>The company\u2019s capacity to explore the treatment\u2018s potential for different conditions will only improve with time, says HistoSonics CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-blue-860b9522/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Blue</a>. The company has fresh resources to accelerate R&amp;D: A new ownership group, which includes billionaire Jeff Bezos, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250807749442/en/HistoSonics-Announces-%242.25B-Acquisition-by-Consortium-of-Top-Tier-Investors\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> HistoSonics in August 2025 at a valuation of US $2.25 billion. </p><p>Engineers are already testing a new guidance system that uses a form of X-rays rather than ultrasound imaging, which should expand use cases. The R&amp;D team is also developing a feedback system that analyzes echoes from the therapeutic ultrasound to detect tissue destruction and integrates that information into the live display, says Blue.</p><p>If those advances pan out, histotripsy could move well beyond the liver, kidney, and pancreas in the fight against cancer. What started as a curiosity about bubbles might soon become a new pillar of noninvasive medicine\u2014a future in which surgeons wield not scalpels, but sound waves.</p><p><em>This article appears in the January 2026 print issue.</em></p>"
