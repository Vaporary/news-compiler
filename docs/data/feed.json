        "summary": "The extent to which women participate in the labor market varies greatly across the globe. If such differences reflect distortions that women face in accessing good jobs, they can reduce economic activity through a misallocation of talent. In this paper, we build on Hsieh et al. (2019) to provide a methodology to quantify these productivity consequences. The index we propose, the \u201dGlobal Gender Distortions Index (GGDI)\u201d, measures the losses in aggregate productivity that gender-based misallocation imposes. Our index allows us to separately identify labor demand distortions (e.g., discrimination in hiring for formal jobs) from labor supply distortions (e.g., frictions that discourage women\u2019s labor force participation) and can be computed using data on labor income and job types. Our methodology also highlights an important distinction between welfare-relevant misallocation and the consequences on aggregate GDP if misallocation arises between market work and non-market activities. To showcase the versatility of our index, we analyze gender misallocation within countries over time, across countries over the development spectrum, and across local labor markets within countries. We find that misallocation is substantial and that demand distortions account for most of the productivity losses."

        "summary": "As Ukraine emerges from the devastation of war, it faces a historic opportunity to engineer its own Wirtschaftswunder\u2014a productivity-driven economic transformation akin to post-war West Germany. While investment-led growth may offer quick wins, it is efficiency, innovation, and institutional reform that will determine Ukraine\u2019s long-term economic trajectory. Drawing on rich micro-level firm data spanning 25 years, this paper uncovers deep structural distortions that have suppressed creative destruction and productivity in Ukraine. It finds that business dynamism is on the decline, alongside rising market concentration among incumbent businesses, including low productivity state owned enterprises. To inform priorities for reviving business dynamism, this study develops a model of creative destruction drawing on Acemoglu et al. (2018) and Akcigit et al. (2021). The quantitative assessment highlights that policies that discipline entrenched incumbents are the bedrock for reviving business dynamism and engineer Ukraine\u2019s Wirtschaftswunder. Policies targeting specific types of firms have limited efficacy when incumbents run wild."

        "summary": "With higher education costs consistently outpacing inflation and public funding declining, college affordability has become a critical barrier to economic mobility for middle- and low-income families. While College Savings Accounts (CSAs), or 529 plans, offer tax-advantaged vehicles for college savings, their adoption patterns and educational impacts remain poorly understood. Using comprehensive administrative data from over 900,000 Illinois 529 accounts (2000-2023) linked to educational outcomes, plus complementary surveys of account owners and parents, we provide the first large-scale analysis of CSA participation and effectiveness. We find that while CSA adoption has expanded to every ZIP code in Illinois, participation remains concentrated among higher-income, more educated families. Financial literacy emerges as a key barrier: 61% of parents who could save enough to cover half of future college costs still perceive their potential savings as meaningless. Among participants, higher savings are strongly correlated with better educational outcomes, including four-year college enrollment, attendance at selective institutions, and the pursuit of post-graduate degrees. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing financial literacy gaps and misperceptions about modest savings could significantly expand CSA effectiveness as a tool for educational equity. Beyond state-level 529 program optimization, our findings suggest several promising avenues for federal policy coordination and institutional innovation."

        "summary": "We use a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model of international investment and production to investigate the real implications of the last five decades of financial globalization. We introduce a wedge accounting framework to estimate country- and time-varying measures of outward and inward Revealed Capital Account Openness (RKO). We show how to identify these wedges for a large panel of countries using limited publicly available data on national accounts and external asset and liability positions since the 1970s. Our analysis reveals striking cross-country differences in the pace and direction of financial account opening: wealthier countries have become relatively more open to foreign capital inflows, while poorer countries have become relatively more open to capital outflows, a phenomenon we call \u201cUnbalanced Financial Globalization.\u201d Counterfactual simulations show that this unbalanced financial globalization has worsened capital allocation, resulting in a 5.9% decrease in world GDP, a 3.4% rise in cross-country income inequality, lower wages in poorer countries, and a decline in rates of return on capital in richer countries. In contrast, if financial account opening had been uniform, the improved allocation of capital would have reduced income inequality, and increased global GDP. These findings underscore the crucial role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping the real impact of international capital markets integration."

The early stages of startup formation remain one of the least understood aspects of firm growth. The nature of this program and the data collected from its operations are well suited to investigate open questions in entrepreneurial strategy, entrepreneurial finance, advice, and technology transfer. This dataset combines three critical features for rigorous empirical research. First, the large, multi-year sample includes roughly 15,000 applicants, 9,000 founders in admitted startups, and nearly 2,000 mentors. Second, CDL recognized the academic value from the outset and built enterprise IT linking venture-level characteristics, structured longitudinal records of firm development and operations, and unstructured verbatim transcripts of mentor\u2013founder discussions. Third, the data cover 27 technological domains such as therapeutics and quantum computing. This paper provides an overview of the setting from which data is collected, a high-level description of available data, and information on how to access these data for research."

Reducing information frictions may make it easier for effective teachers to move to their preferred schools and increase cross-school inequality, but it may also attract high-quality entrants and improve market-level teacher quality. Taking these factors into account, we develop an equilibrium model of the teacher labor market and estimate it using data from the Houston Independent School District, which launched a transparent teacher evaluation system in 2011. Counterfactual simulations reveal that (1) making district teachers\u2019 quality observable to all district schools improves average teacher quality at the district level and in the top and bottom quartiles of schools ranked by student performance, while decreasing it in other schools; (2) budget-neutral bonus programs that incentivize high-quality teachers to teach in low-performing schools can increase overall teacher quality and reduce cross-school inequalities; and (3) these programs are more effective in markets with cross-employer information symmetry."

        "summary": "We estimate the impacts of large-scale unconditional cash transfers on child survival. One-time transfers of USD 1000 were provided to over 10,500 poor households across 653 randomized villages in Kenya. We collected census data on over 100,000 births, including on mortality and cause of death, and detailed data on household health behaviors. Unconditional cash transfers (accounting for spillovers) lead to 48% fewer infant deaths before age one and 45% fewer child deaths before age five. Detailed data on cause of death, transfer timing relative to birth, and the location of health facilities indicate that unconditional cash transfers and access to delivery care are complements in generating mortality reductions: the largest gains are estimated in neonatal and maternal causes of death largely preventable by appropriate obstetric care and among households living close to physician-staffed facilities and those who receive the transfer around the time of birth, and treatment leads to a large increase in hospital deliveries (by 45%). The infant and child mortality declines are concentrated among poorer households with below median assets or predicted consumption. The transfers also result in a substantial decline of 51% in female labor supply in the three months before and the three months after a birth, and improved child nutrition. Infant and child mortality largely revert to pre-program levels after cash transfers end. Despite not being the main aim of the original program, we show that unconditional cash transfers in this setting may be a cost-effective way to reduce infant and child deaths."

This was the \u201coveremployed\u201d craze, and the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/\" target=\"_blank\">/r/overemployed</a> subreddit ballooned to nearly half a million members. The dream was to earn double the income, accelerate the path to financial freedom, and subtly defy corporate America.</span></p><p>As we\u2019ve come back to physical offices, overemployment has become less common, but I was shocked when an engineer recently told me he was working two full-time jobs. He was enjoying the extra pay, but he was also stressed out about keeping secrets from both his managers. Beyond the anxiety of juggling two jobs, overemployment is clearly a career-limiting move for engineers.</p><p>Beyond the obvious contractual breaches\u2014most full-time employment agreements explicitly forbid this kind of moonlighting without consent\u2014overemployment is simply a bad idea.</p><p>With overemployment, you\u2019re essentially trying to \u201cget by\u201d in two roles. Instead of building strong relationships and genuinely contributing, you must perform a delicate balancing act, hoping neither employer catches on. This is incredibly short-sighted. Your career growth isn\u2019t about accumulating company logos; it\u2019s about the skills you acquire, the impact you make, and the people who can advocate for you. You\u2019ll grow exponentially faster\u2014and frankly, have a lot more fun\u2014 if you commit fully to one role.</p><p>The temporary financial bump of overemployment comes at a steep price; your coworkers will likely stop trusting you. This concern increases as you become more senior. At the Staff or Principal Engineer level, your <span>job</span> will depend on the relationships you\u2019ve built and your ability to work with (and through) other people. Overemployment, especially when it\u2019s a covert operation, is a fundamental violation of trust. How can you provide meaningful mentorship or truly collaborate when you\u2019re hiding a massive part of your professional life? I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible.</p><p>The ultimate career hack is quite simple: commit fully to a <span>job</span> where you\u2019re surrounded by smart coworkers in a company that\u2019s growing rapidly. This is far less complicated (and more ethical) than overemployment. This advice applies equally to engineers who believe they can do multiple personal projects alongside their full-time <span>job</span>.</p><p>The compounding effect of real skill development, strong professional relationships, and single-threaded focus will provide significantly better returns than any short-term double-dipping scheme.

Of those three features, data integrity will become of paramount importance.</p><h3>Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Blue rocket launching near a tower with an explosive burst overhead.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8b9a4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blue-rocket-launching-near-a-tower-with-an-explosive-burst-overhead.png?id=61453398&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A 64-bit velocity calculation was converted to</span> a 16-bit output, causing an error called overflow. The corrupted data triggered catastrophic course corrections that forced the US $370 million rocket to self-destruct.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>When we have agency in digital spaces, we naturally maintain their integrity\u2014protecting them from deterioration and shaping them with intention. But in territories controlled by distant platforms, where we\u2019re merely temporary visitors, that connection frays. A disconnect emerges between those who benefit from data and those who bear the consequences of compromised integrity. Like homeowners who care deeply about maintaining the property they own, users in the Web 3.0 paradigm will become stewards of their personal digital spaces.</p><p>This will be critical in a world where <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-agents\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> don\u2019t just answer our questions but act on our behalf. These agents may execute financial transactions, coordinate complex workflows, and autonomously operate critical infrastructure, making decisions that ripple through entire industries. As digital agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the question is no longer whether we will trust AI but what that trust is built upon. In the new age we\u2019re entering, the foundation isn\u2019t intelligence or efficiency\u2014it\u2019s integrity.</p><h2>What Is Data Integrity?</h2><p>In information systems, integrity is the guarantee that data will not be modified without authorization, and that all transformations are verifiable throughout the data\u2019s life cycle. While availability ensures that systems are running and confidentiality prevents unauthorized access, integrity focuses on whether information is accurate, unaltered, and consistent across systems and over time.</p><h3>NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract satellite orbiting orange planet on a dark blue background with scattered dots.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"016f0\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-satellite-orbiting-orange-planet-on-a-dark-blue-background-with-scattered-dots.png?id=61453435&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br />Lockheed Martin\u2019s software calculated thrust in pound-seconds, while NASA\u2019s navigation software expected newton-seconds. The failure caused the $328 million spacecraft to burn up in the Mars atmosphere.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It\u2019s a new idea. The undo button, which prevents accidental data loss, is an integrity feature. So is the reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state. Checksums are an integrity feature; so are verifications of network transmission.</p><p>Without integrity, security measures can backfire. Encrypting corrupted data just locks in errors. Systems that score high marks for availability but spread misinformation just become amplifiers of risk.</p><p>All IT systems require some form of data integrity, but the need for it is especially pronounced in two areas today. First: Internet of Things devices interact directly with the physical world, so corrupted input or output can result in real-world harm. Second: AI systems are only as good as the integrity of the data they\u2019re trained on, and the integrity of their decision-making processes. If that foundation is shaky, the results will be too.</p><p>Integrity manifests in four key areas. The first, <em>input integrity,</em> concerns the quality and authenticity of data entering a system. When this fails, consequences can be severe. In 2021, <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook\u2019s global outage</a> was triggered by a single mistaken command\u2014an input error missed by automated systems. Protecting input integrity requires robust authentication of data sources, cryptographic signing of sensor data, and diversity in input channels for cross-validation.</p><p>The second issue is <em>processing integrity,</em> which ensures that systems transform inputs into outputs correctly. In 2003, the <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Documents/August_2003_Blackout_Final_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.\u2013Canada blackout</a> affected 55 million people when a control-room process failed to refresh properly, resulting in damages exceeding US $6 billion. Safeguarding processing integrity means formally verifying algorithms, cryptographically protecting models, and monitoring systems for anomalous behavior.</p><h3>Microsoft\u2019s Tay Chatbot (2016)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract robot illustration with orange eyes, yellow face, blue-black mouth and beige background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fca2a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-robot-illustration-with-orange-eyes-yellow-face-blue-black-mouth-and-beige-background.png?id=61454030&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Released on Twitter, Microsoft</span>\u2019s AI chatbot was vulnerable to a \u201crepeat after me\u201d command, which meant it would echo any offensive content fed to it.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><em>Storage integrity</em> covers the correctness of information as it\u2019s stored and communicated. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration was <a href=\"https://www.thestack.technology/faa-outage-cause-notam-database-file-not-cyber/\" target=\"_blank\">forced to halt</a> all U.S. departing flights because of a corrupted database file. Addressing this risk requires cryptographic approaches that make any modification computationally infeasible without detection, distributed storage systems to prevent single points of failure, and rigorous backup procedures.</p><p>Finally, <em>contextual integrity</em> addresses the appropriate flow of information according to the norms of its larger context. It\u2019s not enough for data to be accurate; it must also be used in ways that respect expectations and boundaries. For example, if a smart speaker listens in on casual family conversations and uses the data to build advertising profiles, that action would violate the expected boundaries of data collection. Preserving contextual integrity requires clear data-governance policies, principles that limit the use of data to its intended purposes, and mechanisms for enforcing information-flow constraints.</p><p>As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions with reduced human oversight, all these dimensions of integrity become critical.</p><h2>The Need for Integrity in Web 3.0</h2><p>As the digital landscape has shifted from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and now evolves toward Web 3.0, we\u2019ve seen each era bring a different emphasis in the <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad\" target=\"_blank\">CIA triad</a> of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><h3>Boeing 737 MAX (2018)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Cartoon airplane crashes into water; orange 'X' symbol above indicates failure.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8f82b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/cartoon-airplane-crashes-into-water-orange-x-symbol-above-indicates-failure.png?id=61454071&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Input integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Faulty sensor data caused a</span>n automated flight-control system to repeatedly push the airplane\u2019s nose down, leading to a fatal crash.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Returning to our home metaphor: When simply having shelter is what matters most, availability takes priority\u2014the house must exist and be functional. Once that foundation is secure, confidentiality becomes important\u2014you need locks on your doors to keep others out. Only after these basics are established do you begin to consider integrity, to ensure that what\u2019s inside the house remains trustworthy, unaltered, and consistent over time.</p><p>Web 1.0 of the 1990s prioritized making information available. Organizations digitized their content, putting it out there for anyone to access. In Web 2.0, the Web of today, platforms for e-commerce, social media, and cloud computing prioritize confidentiality, as personal data has become the Internet\u2019s currency.</p><p>Somehow, integrity was largely lost along the way. In our current Web architecture, where control is centralized and removed from individual users, the concern for integrity has diminished. The massive social media platforms have created environments where no one feels responsible for the truthfulness or quality of what circulates.</p><h3>SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack (2020)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Capitol building with skull emblem and coding patterns, symbolizing cybersecurity threats.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e236\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/capitol-building-with-skull-emblem-and-coding-patterns-symbolizing-cybersecurity-threats.png?id=61454168&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Russian hackers compromised </span>the process that SolarWinds used to package its software, injecting malicious code that was distributed to 18,000 customers, including nine federal agencies.

This is not speculative; it\u2019s already emerging. For example, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol behind decentralized social networks like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, combines content sharing with built-in attribution. Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solid protocol</a> restructures the Web around personal data pods with granular access controls.</p><p>These technologies prioritize integrity through cryptographic verification that proves authorship, decentralized architectures that eliminate vulnerable central authorities, machine-readable semantics that make meaning explicit\u2014structured data formats that allow computers to understand participants and actions, such as \u201cAlice performed surgery on Bob\u201d\u2014and transparent governance where rules are visible to all. As AI systems become more autonomous, communicating directly with one another via standardized protocols, these integrity controls will be essential for maintaining trust.</p><h2>Why Data Integrity Matters in AI</h2><p>For AI systems, integrity is crucial in four domains. The first is decision quality. With AI increasingly contributing to decision-making in health care, justice, and finance, the integrity of both data and models\u2019 actions directly impact human welfare. Accountability is the second domain. Understanding the causes of failures requires reliable logging, audit trails, and system records.</p><h3>ChatGPT Data Leak (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Unlocked orange padlock with phone displaying keyhole; purple background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b856\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/unlocked-orange-padlock-with-phone-displaying-keyhole-purple-background.png?id=61454212&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A bug in </span>OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT mixed different users\u2019 conversation histories. Users suddenly had other people\u2019s chats appear in their interfaces with no way to prove the conversations weren\u2019t theirs.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The third domain is the security relationships between components. Many authentication systems rely on the integrity of identity information and cryptographic keys. If these elements are compromised, malicious agents could impersonate trusted systems, potentially creating cascading failures as AI agents interact and make decisions based on corrupted credentials.</p><p>Finally, integrity matters in our public definitions of safety. Governments worldwide are introducing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\" target=\"_self\">rules for AI</a> that focus on data accuracy, transparent algorithms, and verifiable claims about system behavior. Integrity provides the basis for meeting these legal obligations.</p><p>The importance of integrity only grows as AI systems are entrusted with more critical applications and operate with less human oversight. While people can sometimes detect integrity lapses, autonomous systems may not only miss warning signs\u2014they may exponentially increase the severity of breaches. Without assurances of integrity, organizations will not trust AI systems for important tasks, and we won\u2019t realize the full potential of AI.</p><h2>How to Build AI Systems With Integrity</h2><p>Imagine an AI system as a home we\u2019re building together. The integrity of this home doesn\u2019t rest on a single security feature but on the thoughtful integration of many elements: solid foundations, well-constructed walls, clear pathways between rooms, and shared agreements about how spaces will be used.</p><h3>Midjourney Bias (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract digital screen with colorful user icons and communication symbols.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"59897\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-digital-screen-with-colorful-user-icons-and-communication-symbols.png?id=61454522&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Contextual integrity failure</strong> <br />Users discovered that the AI image generator often produced biased images of people, such as showing white men as CEOs regardless of the prompt. The AI tool didn\u2019t accurately reflect the context requested by the users.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We begin by laying the cornerstone: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\" target=\"_self\">cryptographic verification</a>. Digital signatures ensure that data lineage is traceable, much like a title deed proves ownership. Decentralized identifiers act as digital passports, allowing components to prove identity independently. When the front door of our AI home recognizes visitors through their own keys rather than through a vulnerable central doorman, we create resilience in the architecture of trust.</p><p>Formal verification methods enable us to mathematically prove the structural integrity of critical components, ensuring that systems can withstand pressures placed upon them\u2014especially in high-stakes domains where lives may depend on an AI\u2019s decision.</p><p>Just as a well-designed home creates separate spaces, trustworthy AI systems are built with thoughtful compartmentalization. We don\u2019t rely on a single barrier but rather layer them to limit how problems in one area might affect others. Just as a kitchen fire is contained by fire doors and independent smoke alarms, training data is separated from the AI\u2019s inferences and output to limit the impact of any single failure or breach.</p><p>Throughout this AI home, we build transparency into the design: The equivalent of large windows that allow light into every corner is clear pathways from input to output. We install monitoring systems that continuously check for weaknesses, alerting us before small issues become catastrophic failures.</p><h3>Prompt Injection Attacks (2023\u20132024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Stylized blue bug on screen with keyboard; sad face in orange circle connected by line.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c6e75\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/stylized-blue-bug-on-screen-with-keyboard-sad-face-in-orange-circle-connected-by-line.png?id=61454587&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input integrity failure</strong> <br />Attackers embedded hidden prompts in emails, documents, and websites that hijacked AI assistants, causing them to treat malicious instructions as legitimate commands.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>But a home isn\u2019t just a physical structure, it\u2019s also the agreements we make about how to live within it. Our governance frameworks act as these shared understandings. Before welcoming new residents, we provide them with certification standards. Just as landlords conduct credit checks, we conduct integrity assessments to evaluate newcomers. And we strive to be good neighbors, aligning our community agreements with broader societal expectations.</p><p>Perhaps most important, we recognize that our AI home will shelter diverse individuals with varying needs. Our governance structures must reflect this diversity, bringing many stakeholders to the table. A truly trustworthy system cannot be designed only for its builders but must serve anyone authorized to eventually call it home.</p><p>That\u2019s how we\u2019ll create AI systems worthy of trust: not by blindly believing in their perfection but because we\u2019ve intentionally designed them with integrity controls at every level.</p><h2>A Challenge of Language</h2><p>Unlike other properties of security, like \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cprivate,\u201d we don\u2019t have a common adjective form for \u201cintegrity.\u201d This makes it hard to talk about it. It turns out that there is a word in English: \u201cintegrous.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recorded the word used in the mid-1600s but now <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/integrous_adj?tab=factsheet&amp;tl=true#210671\" target=\"_blank\">declares it obsolete</a>.</p><h3>CrowdStrike\u00a0Outage (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Three panels: people on escalator, government building, hospital with red cross flag.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"031f4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-panels-people-on-escalator-government-building-hospital-with-red-cross-flag.png?id=61454608&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Processing integrity failure</strong><br />A faulty software update from CrowdStrike caused 8.5 million Windows computers worldwide to crash\u2014grounding flights, shutting down hospitals, and disrupting banks.

The update, which contained a software logic error, hadn\u2019t gone through full testing protocols.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We believe that the word needs to be revived. We need the ability to describe a system with integrity. We must be able to talk about integrous systems design.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><p>Ensuring integrity in AI presents formidable challenges. As models grow larger and more complex, maintaining integrity without sacrificing performance becomes difficult. Integrity controls often require computational resources that can slow systems down\u2014particularly challenging for real-time applications. Another concern is that emerging technologies like quantum computing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2668949802\" target=\"_self\">threaten current cryptographic protections</a>. Additionally, the distributed nature of modern AI\u2014which relies on vast ecosystems of libraries, frameworks, and services\u2014presents a large attack surface.</p><p>Beyond technology, integrity depends heavily on social factors. Companies often prioritize speed to market over robust integrity controls. Development teams may lack specialized knowledge for implementing these controls, and may find it particularly difficult to integrate them into legacy systems. And while some governments have begun establishing regulations for aspects of AI, we need worldwide alignment on governance for AI integrity.</p><h3>Voice-Clone Scams (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"People holding phones, speech bubble showing happiness, money, and skull emoji.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"26ea5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/people-holding-phones-speech-bubble-showing-happiness-money-and-skull-emoji.png?id=61454716&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input and processing integrity failure</strong><br />Scammers used AI-powered voice-cloning tools to mimic the voices of victims\u2019 family members, tricking people into sending money. These scams succeeded because neither phone systems nor victims identified the AI-generated voice as fake.<br /></p><p><span>Addressing these challenges requires sustained research into verifying and enforcing integrity, as well as recovering from breaches. Priority areas include fault-tolerant algorithms for distributed learning, verifiable computation on encrypted data, techniques that maintain integrity despite adversarial attacks, and standardized metrics for certification. We also need interfaces that clearly communicate integrity status to human overseers.</span></p><p>As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the stakes for integrity have never been higher. We are entering an era where machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous agents will operate with reduced human oversight and make decisions with profound impacts.</p><p>The good news is that the tools for building systems with integrity already exist. What\u2019s needed is a shift in mind-set: from treating integrity as an afterthought to accepting that it\u2019s the core organizing principle of AI security.</p><p>The next era of technology will be defined not by what AI can do, but by whether we can trust it to know or especially to do what\u2019s right. Integrity\u2014in all its dimensions\u2014will determine the answer. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

The directives, delivered via a set of four executive orders, set ambitious goals, such as having <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/reinvigorating-the-nuclear-industrial-base/\" target=\"_blank\">10 new large reactors</a> under construction by 2030, and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission/\" target=\"_blank\">overhauling the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (NRC).</p><p>One <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/deploying-advanced-nuclear-reactor-technologies-for-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\">particularly eager provision</a> instructs the U.S. Department of Energy to designate, within 90 days, at least one site on DOE-controlled land for the deployment of an advanced nuclear reactor\u2014a nearly impossible deadline that\u2019s coming up August 21.</p><p>The orders sparked a flurry of discussion across the nuclear industry and sent stakeholders scrambling. Experts weighed the promise of accelerated nuclear deployments against the potential of losing regulatory integrity. Whether the U.S. government, military, and industry stakeholders can meet the demands of the directives and timelines is unclear.</p><p>As someone with deep expertise in nuclear project development and licensing, I\u2019ve chosen to focus this article on the 90-day site-selection directive\u2014perhaps the first litmus test to see if the Trump administration will execute on its challenging deadlines.<strong> </strong></p><p>The process for selecting a site for a new nuclear plant in the United States is an arduous and complex process that blends engineering feasibility, environmental science, safety, emergency planning, economics, and public trust, all while complying with regulations and guidance. It\u2019s never been done in 90 days, at least not with regulatory approval.</p><p>But there might be one way for the DOE to meet that deadline: Rely on sites that are already deeply prepared with existing documentation and few unknowns. There are two locations in the United States that come close to fitting this category: <a href=\"https://inl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho National Laboratory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>.</p><h2>How to Pick a Site for an Advanced Nuclear Reactor</h2><p>To host a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States, a site must first receive a license from the NRC. To get that license, reactor owners typically take a couple of years to prepare the application, 6 to 12 months of which is needed to perform and document the site-selection process. The regulator then reviews the application and performs an environmental impact statement (EIS)\u2014a process that historically took more than two years, but is <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/29/2025-09798/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission\" target=\"_blank\">now required to be completed in 18 months, per new directives</a>.</p><p>The first step in selecting a site is to identify the region of interest. Next, unsuitable or problematic parts of that region, such as those that are prone to earthquakes, flooding, or landslides, are eliminated.</p><p>Remaining areas of land in the region are then assessed for technical and environmental suitability. For a small modular reactor (SMR), a type of advanced nuclear reactor, an ideal site size is a couple of hundred acres (about 80 hectares), while a thousand acres (over 400 ha) is ideal for a large nuclear plant. Reactors also need sufficient cooling water, which typically comes from a nearby ocean, lake, river, or aquafer.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Pushes $900 Million for Small Modular Reactor</a></p><p>Developers must assess the nearby population and infrastructure, search for endangered species, and assess wetlands. Business factors are also considered, such as distance to interconnection with transmission, cost to install and operate cooling, and the amount of site grading needed.</p><p>Finally, applicants assign weighting values to the criteria and rate sites against the various parameters. This iterative process, followed by further field investigations and narrowing of options, leads to the selection of one preferred site, with two to four others defined as alternatives. After that, the NRC reviews the application and proceeds with the environmental impact statement process.</p><h2>DOE\u2019s Looming Site-Selection Deadline</h2><p>It\u2019s unclear how far along the DOE is in its attempt to comply with the executive order\u2019s 90-day challenge to pick a site for a nuclear plant. Meeting the deadline will require creative thinking and decisive action.</p><p>With that in mind, the best path forward for the DOE is to focus on sites that have already undergone National Environmental Policy Act review and some NRC licensing. The DOE\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=Idaho+National+Lab\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho National Laboratory</a> (INL) in Idaho Falls, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=oak+ridge+national+Lab\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) in Tennessee, both meet those criteria.</p><p>Near INL, there are two options: the site where <a href=\"https://www.nuscalepower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NuScale Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uamps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems</a> were pursuing an NRC license for an SMR facility before <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactors-nuscale\" target=\"_blank\">abandoning the project</a> in November 2023, and the site proposed for the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/fc/areva-eagle-rock-lc.html\" target=\"_blank\">Eagle Rock uranium enrichment facility</a> that received a license in 2011 but was not constructed.</p><p>INL has hosted <a href=\"https://inl.gov/history/52-reactors/#:~:text=Nuclear%20Heritage,square%2Dmile%20site%20since%201949.\" target=\"_blank\">52 reactors since 1949</a>, so it\u2019s likely a suitable place from an environmental and safety perspective. Although both the NuScale and Eagle Rock sites meet the intent of the executive order, neither received an environmental impact statement from the NRC for a new nuclear reactor. Further, the Eagle Rock site is adjacent to INL, not on its site.</p><p>Perhaps the ideal choice is the 935-acre (378-ha) parcel of land on a peninsula on the Clinch River in Tennessee, adjacent to ORNL. The site is federally owned, currently controlled by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is the only site in the United States that has received a green light\u2014an early site permit from the NRC\u2014for SMRs.</p><p>The Clinch River site was partially developed in the 1970s for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor project, a liquid-metal fast breeder reactor that was abandoned in the early 1980s. The NRC in 2019 licensed the site to TVA for the construction and operation of two or more SMRs. This <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1935/ML19352D868.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">permit</a> allows for up to 800 megawatts electric (MWe) of nuclear power and followed a thorough environmental and safety review that remains valid through 2039.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An illustration imagines what the TVA BWRX-300 SMR as a large white building and electrical equipment surrounded by lush green forests and land, with a river and city in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5f2ff\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-imagines-what-the-tva-bwrx-300-smr-as-a-large-white-building-and-electrical-equipment-surrounded-by-lush-green-f.jpg?id=61421173&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A small modular reactor called the BWRX-300, developed by GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy, is planned for the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s Clinch River site.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">TVA </small></p><p>In May this year, <a href=\"https://www.tva.com/news-media/releases/tva-submits-nation-s-first-construction-permit-application-for-bwrx-300-smr\" target=\"_blank\">TVA requested a construction permit</a> to build on that site an SMR called the <a href=\"https://www.gevernova.com/nuclear/carbon-free-power/bwrx-300-small-modular-reactor\" target=\"_blank\">BWRX-300</a>, a boiling-water reactor, which would have a capacity of 300 MWe. But the site can accommodate additional SMRs and other advanced or microreactor units, which would fulfill the executive order\u2019s objectives.</p><h2>Clinch River Is Ideal for New Nuclear</h2><p>TVA was prescient in its thinking: Its stated objectives for the Clinch River site include powering mission-critical electricity loads for national defense, which aligns with the executive order\u2019s priorities. In fact, TVA\u2019s 2016 application assessed underground transmission lines to serve mission-critical loads on ORNL\u2014a design feature that makes it less susceptible to intentional destructive acts and natural phenomena such as tornadoes.</p><p>The area already hosts the DOE\u2019s largest electricity user, the <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/tema/prepare/technical-hazards/department-of-energy/about-the-oak-ridge-reservation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge Reservation</a>, which includes ORNL and the <a href=\"https://www.y12.doe.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Y-12 National Security Complex</a>, where nuclear-weapons components are manufactured and highly enriched uranium is stored and processed. Historically, the region supported the K-25 uranium-enrichment facility, which consumed, until the 1980s, more than 1,000 MWe. Today, the robust power infrastructure built to serve K-25 remains available in Oak Ridge, including redundant 161- and 500-kilovolt  transmission lines that transect the Clinch River site.</p><p>East Tennessee is also home to one of the nation\u2019s deepest and most experienced nuclear workforces, with TVA, DOE, the University of Tennessee, and many private-sector nuclear companies including <a href=\"https://www.centrusenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Centrus Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://kairospower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kairos Power</a>, <a href=\"https://laseristech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LIS Technologies</a>, <a href=\"https://nanonuclearenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Nuclear Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.orano.group/usa/en/our-news/news-releases/2025/orano-opens-project-ike-office-in-oak-ridge-tennessee-to-support-developing-its-american-uranium-enrichment-facility\" target=\"_blank\">Orano</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.standardnuclear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Nuclear</a>, <a href=\"https://typeoneenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Type One Energy</a>, and <a href=\"https://x-energy.com/fuel/triso-x\" target=\"_blank\">X-Energy</a>, plus numerous smaller suppliers, all calling Oak Ridge home.</p><p>TVA has not, thus far, catered to data centers\u2014one of the Trump administration\u2019s priorities. But on 24 July the DOE named the Oak Ridge Reservation one of four locations where it will invite private-sector partners to <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-site-selection-ai-data-center-and-energy-infrastructure-development-federal\" target=\"_blank\">develop cutting-edge AI data-center and energy-generation projects</a>. An adjacent advanced-nuclear plant on the Clinch River site would pair nicely.</p><h2>TVA\u2019s New Nuclear Constraints</h2><p>This rare combination of attributes simply doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere, and makes the Clinch River site the ideal location to try to meet the provisions in the executive orders. But several challenges lie ahead.</p><p>TVA\u2019s status as a federally owned corporation comes with constraints that impede progress. Namely, a US $30 billion cap on the amount of debt it can take on was bestowed upon it through the <a href=\"https://www.tva.com/about-tva/our-history/the-tva-act\" target=\"_blank\">TVA Act</a> and hasn\u2019t been increased since 1979. TVA has been <a href=\"https://www.powermag.com/americas-nuclear-renaissance-how-the-tva-can-lead-our-energy-future/\" target=\"_blank\">accused of moving too slowly</a> in the development of advanced nuclear and SMRs, and Tennessee senators and the president have called for leadership change at the power provider.</p><p>Successful execution of the directive will require leadership within the Trump administration. It will require TVA to seek creative solutions and overcome its constraints. One option would be to transfer the Clinch River site and its permit from TVA to the DOE. Or perhaps the simplest solution is for the DOE to contract for power in a manner that enables third-party financing of new nuclear capacity, so that the debt doesn\u2019t fall on TVA\u2019s balance sheet.</p><p>Given the urgency, importance, and magnitude of the challenge of meeting the United States\u2019 growing electricity needs and to accomplish the intent of the executive orders<strong>,</strong> DOE should designate <em><em>both</em></em> INL and ORNL as locations to host new nuclear reactors.</p>"

Even more concerning are the over 1.2 million pieces of space debris larger than one centimeter hurtling through space at incredible speeds. At those velocities, even a paint chip can damage a spacecraft, while larger debris can <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-jamming\" target=\"_blank\">destroy entire satellites</a>.</p><p>This growing congestion has turned collision avoidance into a daily headache for satellite operators worldwide. Currently, teams of specialists must manually assess threats, calculate risks, and coordinate with other operators when collisions seem likely.

It aims to revolutionize this chaotic process by automating most collision avoidance activities. The system can evaluate potential crashes, generate precise manoeuver plans, and support decision making with minimal human intervention. Think of it as an air traffic control system for space, but with artificial intelligence handling much of the complex coordination.</p><h2>SUBHEAD 1</h2><p>One of CREAM\u2019s most innovative features is its ability to connect different types of organizations involved in space operations. Satellite operators, space monitoring services, regulators, and observers can all communicate through the system, streamlining what was previously a fragmented and often frustrating process.</p><p>The system goes even further by facilitating negotiations between operators when potential collisions involve two active satellites rather than debris. If operators disagree on the best solution, CREAM can refer the dispute to mediation services, ensuring fair and transparent resolution.</p><p>Currently, CREAM exists as a ground-based prototype system developed by <a href=\"https://www.gmv.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">GMV</a>, a Spanish private capital interest group, and <a href=\"https://guardtime.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Guardtime</a>, an Estonian data management company. This version can already provide collision alerts and generate actionable avoidance manoeuvers that ground crews can implement. However, the real breakthrough will come when CREAM moves into orbit itself.</p><p>The project is preparing for expanded pilot testing while simultaneously developing space-based versions. These include \u201cpiggyback missions\u201d where CREAM will ride aboard other spacecraft as a digital payload, plus a dedicated demonstration mission to test the system\u2019s capabilities in the harsh environment of space.</p><p>Beyond preventing immediate collisions, CREAM addresses a fundamental challenge in space governance. Establishing \u201crules of the road\u201d for space traffic has always faced a chicken and egg problem; you need both international agreement on the rules and the technology to enforce them.</p><p>CREAM provides that missing technological foundation. The system offers standardized tools that help operators follow best practices while giving regulators ways to monitor compliance. Its flexible design allows non-technical users to update standards and rules as international norms evolve. This adaptability ensures CREAM will remain relevant as space technology advances and new challenges emerge. Rather than becoming obsolete, the system can grow and adapt alongside our expanding presence in space.</p>"

Today\u2019s technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are evolving quickly, and you need to stay on top of the latest innovations. </li><li>Don\u2019t wait for the perfect opportunity; rather, create it. </li><li>Don\u2019t view yourself as \u201cjust\u201d a software engineer or \u201cjust\u201d an associate engineer. Go the extra mile, even if you aren\u2019t paid to do so. That way, you\u2019ll always be one step ahead of the competition. </li><li>Build solutions that will have a real-world impact, not just theoretical value. Theoretical value is good to study, but make the application practical. When you do practical work, you\u2019ll come to know the difficulties, the failures, and the pros and cons.</li><li>Staying true to yourself will help you grow in your career.</li><li>Stay humble, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they are silly.</li><li>Get involved in a professional organization, such as IEEE, early in your career. You\u2019ll get to know about cutting-edge technologies, meet great leaders, and pick up skills that will help your career.</li></ul><p><span>\u201cIEEE stays updated on the frontier of technologies and gives back to the engineering community,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt also provides services to students and initiates talks where we can explore topics with respect to our skills and knowledge, and mentor others.\u201d</span></p><p>Interested in volunteering and mentoring, he decided to nominate himself for the position of IEEE Richmond Section chair. The section has more than 800 members and covers six cities and 26 counties.</p><p>Being chair is his first volunteer leadership position. He says he believed that running the section would enhance his leadership skills. Winning the election \u201cwas a miracle,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was another enrichment opportunity for my career.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/about/excom-2/\" target=\"_blank\">He began his term in January</a> and was initially anxious about the additional workload, he says, but so far his term has been an \u201camazing experience.\u201d He credits IEEE Senior Member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenjjones/\" target=\"_blank\">Allen Jones</a>, a past chair of the section, for helping him through the transition.</p><p>Pandy has been busy since taking office. The section formed a <a href=\"https://life.ieee.org/volunteers/life-members-affinity-groups/\" target=\"_blank\">life members affinity group</a> and has held events with the <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/vcu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Virginia Commonwealth University student branch</a> in Richmond. The section also held <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/leadership-skills-ieee-courses\" target=\"_blank\">career-development</a> events there, allowing IEEE members to mentor engineering students, provide them with networking tips, and help them refine their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://ieeemagnetics.org/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Magnetics Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society</a> chapters partnered with VCU, <a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI Ready RVA</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ritsva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Richmond Institute of Technology and Science</a> to increase<a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> artificial intelligence literacy for preuniversity students in underserved communities</a>. The initiative provides training to educators and offers workshops to students demonstrating the technology and its practical applications.</p><p>Through leading all those activities, Pandy says, he has picked up important skills including strategic planning, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5-tips-technical-presentations\" target=\"_blank\">public speaking</a>, team collaboration, and budget planning, which he can apply at work.</p><p>\u201cThese experiences have helped me drive large-scale IT transformation projects in my professional role,\u201d he says, \u201cand improved my ability to lead diverse and cross-functional teams.</p><p>\u201cVolunteering fuels my energy rather than drains it. Also, it\u2019s kind of a small, rewarding part of my weekly routine. I feel that I\u2019ve done a little bit to help someone somewhere move a step ahead in their career\u2014which gives me great satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Pandy hasn\u2019t lost his desire to be an entertainer.

The standard was a result of a <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 memorandum</a> from the Biden administration that requires federal agencies to transition to PQC-based security by 2035.</p><p>Cryptography relies on math problems that are nearly impossible to solve, but easy to check if a solution is correct. Armed with such math problems, only the holder of a secret key can check their solution and get access to the secret data. Today, most online cryptography relies on one of two such algorithms: either <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rsa-token-replacement-a-slow-process\" target=\"_blank\">RSA</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography\" target=\"_blank\">elliptic curve cryptography</a>.</p><p>The cause for concern is that quantum computers, if a large enough one is ever built, would make easy work of the \u201chard\u201d problems underlying current cryptographic methods. Luckily, there are other math problems that appear to be equally hard for quantum computers and their existing classical counterparts. That\u2019s the basis of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2667758178\" target=\"_blank\">post-quantum cryptography</a>: cryptography that\u2019s secure against hypothetical quantum computers.</p><p>With the mathematics behind PQC ironed out, and standards in hand, the work of adoption is now underway. This is no easy feat: every computer, laptop, smartphone, self-driving car, or IoT device will have to fundamentally change the way they run cryptography.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ali.elkaafarani\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ali El Kaafarani</a> is a research fellow at the Oxford Mathematical Institute who contributed to the development of NIST\u2019s PQC standards. He also founded a company, <a href=\"https://pqshield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PQShield</a>, to help bring post-quantum cryptography into the real world by assisting original equipment manufacturers in implementing the new protocols. He spoke with <em>IEEE Spectrum <strong></strong><strong></strong></em><span>about</span> how adoption is going and whether the new standards will be implemented in time to beat the looming threat of quantum computers.</p><p><strong>What has changed in the industry since the NIST PQC standards came out?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait photograph of Ali El Kaafarani, dark haired man with a beard, a mustache and glasses\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"65f9b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-photograph-of-ali-el-kaafarani-dark-haired-man-with-a-beard-a-mustache-and-glasses.jpg?id=61455658&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ali El Kaafarani</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">PQShield</small></p><p><strong>Ali El Kaafarani</strong>: Before the standards came out, a lot of people were not talking about it at all, in the spirit of \u201cIf it\u2019s working, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d Once the standards were published, the whole story changed, because now it\u2019s not hypothetical quantum hype, it\u2019s a compliance issue. There are standards published by the U.S. government. There are deadlines for the adoption. And the 2035 [deadline] came together with the publication from [the National Security Agency], and was adopted in formal legislation that passed Congress and therefore there is no way around it. Now it\u2019s a compliance issue.</p><p>Before, people used to ask us, \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer. But that\u2019s the issue, because we\u2019re talking about a risk that can materialize any time. Some other, more intelligent people who have access to a wider range of information decided in 2015 to categorize quantum computing as a real threat. So this year was a transformational year, because the question went from \u201cWhy do we need it?\u201d to \u201cHow are we going to use it?\u201d And the whole supply chain started looking into who\u2019s going to do what, from chip design to the network security layer, to the critical national infrastructure, to build up a post-quantum-enabled network security kit.</p><h2>Challenges in PQC Implementation</h2><p><strong>What are some of the difficulties of implementing the NIST standards?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> You have the beautiful math, you have the algorithms from NIST, but you also have the wild west of cybersecurity. That infrastructure goes from the smallest sensors and car keys, etc., to the largest server sitting there and trying to crunch hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, each with different security requirements, each with different energy consumption requirements. Now that is a different problem. That\u2019s not a mathematical problem, that\u2019s an implementation problem. This is where you need a company like PQShield, where we gather hardware engineers, and firmware engineers, and software engineers, and mathematicians, and everyone else around them to actually say, \u201cWhat can we do with this particular use case?\u201d</p><p>Cryptography is the backbone of cybersecurity infrastructure, and worse than that, it\u2019s the invisible piece that nobody cares about until it breaks. If it\u2019s working, nobody touches it. They only talk about it when there\u2019s a breach, and then they try to fix things. In the end, they usually put bandaids on it. That\u2019s normal, because enterprises can\u2019t sell the security feature to the customers. They were just using it when governments force them, like when there\u2019s a compliance issue. And now it\u2019s a much bigger problem, as someone is telling them, \u201cYou know what, all the cryptography that you\u2019ve been using for the past 15 years, 20 years, you need to change it, actually.\u201d</p><p><strong>Are there security concerns for the PQC algorithm implementations?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> Well, we haven\u2019t done it before. It hasn\u2019t been battle-tested. And now what we\u2019re saying is, \u201cHey, AMD and the rest of the hardware or semiconductor world go and put all those new algorithms in hardware, and trust us, they\u2019re going to work fine, and then nobody\u2019s going to be able to hack them and extract the key.\u201d That\u2019s not easy, right? Nobody has the guts to say this.</p><p>That\u2019s why, at PQShield, we have vulnerability teams that are trying to break our own designs, separately from those teams who are designing things. You have to do this. You need to be one step ahead of attackers. That\u2019s all you need to do, and that\u2019s all you can do, because you can\u2019t say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got something that is secure. Nobody can break it.\u201d If you say that, you\u2019re going eat a humble pie in 10 years\u2019 time, because maybe someone will come up with a way to break it. You need to just do this continuous innovation and continuous security testing for your products.</p><p>Because PQC is new, we still haven\u2019t seen all the creativity of attackers trying to bypass the beautiful mathematics, and come up with those creative and nasty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\" target=\"_blank\">side-channel attacks</a> that just laugh at the mathematics. For example, some attacks look at the energy consumption the algorithm is taking on your laptop, and they extract the key from the differences in energy consumption. Or there are timing attacks that look at how long it takes for you to encrypt the same message 100 times and how that\u2019s changing, and they can actually extract the key. So there are different ways to attack algorithms there, and that\u2019s not new. We just don\u2019t have billions of these devices in in our hands now that have post-quantum cryptography that people have tested.</p><h2>Progress in PQC Adoption</h2><p><strong>How would you say adoption has been going so far?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> The fact that a lot of companies only started when the standards were published, it puts us in a position where there are some that are well advanced in their thoughts and their processes and their adoption, and there are others that are totally new to it because they were not paying attention, and they were just kicking the can down the road. The majority of those who were kicking the can down the road are the ones that don\u2019t sit high up in the supply chain, because they felt like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s responsibility. But they didn\u2019t understand that they have they had to influence their suppliers when it comes to their requirements and timelines and integration and so many things that they have to prepare. This is what\u2019s going on now: A lot of them are doing a lot of work.</p><p>Now, those who sit high up in the supply chain, quite a few of them have made great progress and started embedding post-quantum cryptography designs into new products, and are trying to work out a way to upgrade products that are already on the ground.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re in in a great place, where everyone is doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. That\u2019s not the case. But I think that from last year, when many people were asking \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d and are now asking \u201cHow can I be compliant? Where do you think I should start? And how can I evaluate where the infrastructure to understand where the most valuable assets are, and how can I protect them? What influence can I exercise on my suppliers?\u201d I think huge progress has been made.</p><p>Is it enough? It\u2019s never enough in security. Security is damn difficult. It\u2019s a multi-disciplinary topic. There are two types of people: Those who love to build security products, and those who would love to break them. We\u2019re trying to get most of those who love to break them into the right side of history so that they can make products stronger rather than actually making existing ones vulnerable for exploitation.</p><p><strong>Do you think we\u2019re going to make it by 2035?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> I think that the majority of our infrastructure should be post quantum secure by 2035, and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s a good thought to have. Now, what happens if quantum computers happen to become reality before that? That\u2019s a good topic for a TV series or for a movie. What happens when most secrets are readable? People are not thinking hard enough about it. I don\u2019t think that anyone has an answer for that. <strong></strong></p>"

Growing up in India, he would take apart remote-controlled cars and use the motors and batteries to build something new.</p><p>No one in his family worked in science, technology, engineering, or math, he says, but science has always felt \u201ccompletely natural.\u201d</p><p>His fascination with STEM subjects deepened in high school, and his teachers fueled his passion. But it was M.R. Shenoy, a physics professor at the <a href=\"https://home.iitd.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>, who inspired him to pursue research in the semiconductor field.</p><p>As an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://www.mnnit.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology</a>, in Allahabad, India, Rudra took an online semiconductor optoelectronics certification course offered by NPTEL that was taught by Shenoy.</p><p>Motivated to gain experience in the field, from 2017 to 2019 Rudra completed several internships working on semiconductor fabrication at organizations including the <a href=\"https://iitbhu.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of technology (BHU)</a>, Varanasi; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology</a>, Kharagpur; and the <a href=\"https://www.ceeri.res.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute</a>.</p><p>\u201cThese internships were my first real exposure to experimental research and gave me a foundation in device physics and material science,\u201d he says.</p><p>He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communications engineering from MNNIT in 2019.</p><h2>Working in semiconductor fabrication and FinFET</h2><p>After graduating he became a research assistant at the <a href=\"https://iisc.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), in Bengaluru.</p><p>There he developed a thin film of manganese vanadium oxide using the epitaxy process. The method grows the manganese vanadium oxide on top of the crystal substrate\u2014which gives engineers more control over the film\u2019s thickness, composition, and crystal structure, according to <a href=\"https://www.photonics.com/EDU/epitaxial_deposition/d8286\" target=\"_blank\">Photonics Media</a>. Rudra used the film to develop a photodetector for infrared light.</p><p>After a year he joined semiconductor manufacturer <a href=\"https://gf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GlobalFoundries</a>, also in Bengaluru, as an integration and yield engineer. He continued his work at IISc on the weekends.</p><p>\u201cBefore joining, I had modest expectations\u2014largely because of the limited semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in India,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I realized that hardware-focused work was indeed happening in the industry. That experience planted the seed of transitioning from academia to cutting-edge industrial R&amp;D.\u201d</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cFor any young professional in STEM, IEEE isn\u2019t just a resource; it\u2019s a launchpad.\u201d</span></p><p><span></span>While at GlobalFoundries, he worked on BEOL interconnects to enhance the yield of the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-foundry-finfet\" target=\"_self\">FinFET</a> chips, which are used in automotive technology, smartphones, and smart speakers. In conventional planar transistors, the gate sits atop a flat silicon channel, controlling the flow of current between the source and drain from only one side. As transistors shrank in size, however, they became <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">less reliable and leaked current,</a> wasting power. FinFET development was led by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">Chenming Hu</a>, who received the 2020<a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for the invention. FinFET\u2019s 3D structure provides better control of the current.</p><p>In 2021 Rudra decided to continue his education and was accepted into the master\u2019s degree program in electrical and computer engineering at the <a href=\"https://odei.umich.edu/2023/10/19/university-of-michigan-celebrates-first-generation-college-students-during-week-long-events/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor.</p><p>\u201cI chose this school because there was a particular professor working on LED devices whose research really resonated with me,\u201d he says. The professor, <a href=\"https://mi.engin.umich.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Fellow Zetian Mi</a>, was working on III-V semiconductor optoelectronic devices. Rudra was part of Mi\u2019s research team for the first two semesters of his graduate program, working on the fabrication and characterization of III-Nitride-based microLEDs. Rudra also completed an internship at <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> in Redmond, Wash., where he developed integration processes for waveguide-based photonic devices for AR/VR systems.</p><p>\u201cThat experience helped me understand how photonics intersects with semiconductor manufacturing,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly in emerging applications like next-gen displays and wearable optics.\u201d</p><p>After earning his degree in 2023, he joined <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Semiconductor</a> in Austin, Texas, as a device integration engineer. There he returned to working on FinFETs, but this time analyzing and optimizing device and front-end-of-line integration for 14-nm node technology and how different processes affect the electrical performance and yield of FinFETs.</p><p>After a year, he left to join IBM Research.</p><p>\u201cBeing part of such a high-impact, globally collaborative initiative has been a fantastic experience and one that continues to push me technically and professionally,\u201d he says.</p><p>Since working at the company, he has filed 22 U.S. patents.</p><p>He received a slew of honors last year, including being named to<a href=\"https://www.semiconwest.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon West</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30 list, the<a href=\"https://www.sme.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Society of Manufacturing Engineers</a>\u2019s 30 Under 30, and<a href=\"https://www.semiconeuropa.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon Europa</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30.

Nigeria\u2019s big telecom operators continue to build long-distance, high-capacity fiber-optic networks from the cables to the important commercial nodes in the cities. But distribution to the urban peripheries and to rural places such as Atan is still incomplete.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Incomplete is an understatement: <a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Less than half</a> of the country\u2019s 237 million people have regular access to broadband, with that access mostly happening through <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/statistics-reports/subscriber-data#monthly-subscriber-technology-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mobile devices</a> rather than more stable fixed connections. Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy has set a goal to almost double the length of the country\u2019s fiber-optic backbone and for broadband to reach <a href=\"https://fmcide.gov.ng/ministry-launches-national-broadband-alliance-for-nigeria-nban-to-drive-broadband-connectivity-and-infrastructure-development/\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent of the population</a> by the end of this year. But the ministry also<a href=\"https://von.gov.ng/fg-launches-774-lg-internet-connectivity-project/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> claimed in 2024</a> that it would connect Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments to the broadband backbone; as of February 2025, it had reached only 51. The broadband buildout has been seriously hampered by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nigeria-power-grid\" target=\"_blank\">Nigeria\u2019s unreliable power grid</a>. Beyond the mere inconvenience of frequent outages, the poor quality of electricity drives up costs for operators and customers alike.</p><p>During a visit to Nigeria earlier this year, I talked to dozens of people about broadband\u2019s impact on their lives. For more than two decades, the country has possessed an incredible portal to the world, and so I had hoped to hear stories of transformation. In some cases, I did. But that experience was far from uniform, with much work left to do.</p><h2>Where Nigeria\u2019s broadband has arrived</h2><p>Broadband is enabling all kinds of changes in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country.

The state-run telephone monopoly, Nigerian Telecommunications (Nitel), was mainly responsible for the rollout of SAT-3 within the country. Less than 1 percent of the 130 million Nigerians had phone lines in 2002, so the government established a second carrier, Globacom, to try to accelerate competition in the telecom market.</p><p>But a mixture of mismanagement and wider difficulties contributed to the sluggish spread of broadband, as<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\"> <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> reported in 2004</a>. Broadband access has soared since then, and yet Aliyu of Phase3 Telecom estimates that the country is using only around 25 percent of the total capacity of its undersea cables.</p><p>Nigeria\u2019s unreliable electricity drives up telecom prices, making it harder for poor Nigerians to afford broadband. The spotty power grid means that standard telecom equipment needs backup power. But battery or diesel-powered cellphone towers attract theft, which in turn undermines network reliability.

NTEL backs up the grid electricity with a battery bank and two generators.</p><h2>In Nigeria, mobile broadband is popular</h2><p>What is often missing in Nigeria is the local connection, the last few kilometers leading to customers. In the developed world, that connection works like this: Internet service providers (ISPs) plug into the nearest backbone via one of several technologies and deliver a small slice of bandwidth to their business and residential customers. A switching station called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence\" target=\"_blank\">point of presence</a> (PoP) serves as an on- and off-ramp between the backbone and the ISPs. The ISPs are responsible for installing the fiber-optic cables that lead to their customers; they may also use microwave antennas to beam a signal to customers.</p><p>But in Nigeria, fiber-optic ISPs have been sluggish to capture market share. Of the country\u2019s<a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/internet-service-operator-data\" target=\"_blank\"> 300,000 or so fixed-line broadband subscribers</a>\u2014just 0.001 percent of Nigerians\u2014about a third are served by the leading ISP, <a href=\"https://spectranet.com.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectranet</a>. By comparison, the average fixed broadband penetration rate among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/broadband-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\">42.5 percent in 2023</a>, led by South Korea, with 89.6 percent penetration. </p><p>Starlink\u2019s satellite-based service, <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2025/starlink-nigeria-internet-elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced in Nigeria in 2023</a>, is now the second biggest broadband ISP, with about 60,000 subscribers. That\u2019s almost triple the third biggest ISP, <a href=\"https://fob.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">FiberOne</a>. Satellite is outcompeting fiber because it\u2019s more reliable and has <a href=\"https://www.ookla.com/articles/starlink-ssa-q1-2025\" target=\"_blank\">higher speeds and tolerable latency</a>, even though it costs more. A Starlink satellite terminal can serve up to 200 subscribers and retails for about US $200 plus a $37 monthly fee. A comparable fiber-to-the-home plan in Abuja, where the median monthly take-home pay is $280, costs about $19 a month.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a row of color display cases holding cellphones, with signs offering phone and laptop repair.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"57d0f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-row-of-color-display-cases-holding-cellphones-with-signs-offering-phone-and-laptop-repair.jpg?id=61426635&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In Lagos\u2019s Computer Village, you can buy or sell a mobile phone or computer, or get yours repaired.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>Meanwhile, Nigeria has <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/subscriber-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">142 million cellular subscriptions</a>, and so most Internet users access the Internet wirelessly, via a mobile network. In other words, Nigeria\u2019s mobile market is nearly 500 times as big as the market for fixed broadband. The mobile networks also rely on the fiber-optic backbones, but instead of using PoP gateways, they link to cellular base stations, each of which can reach up to thousands of mobile devices but may not offer ideal quality of service. </p><p>Mobile Internet is a good thing for people who can afford it, which is<a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" target=\"_blank\"> most Nigerians</a>, according to the <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/\" target=\"_blank\">International Telecommunication Union</a>. The cost of fixed-line broadband is still around five times as much, which explains why its market share is so tiny. But mobile Internet isn\u2019t enough to run many businesses, nor do mobile network operators guarantee network speeds or low latency, which are crucial factors for high-frequency trading, telemedicine, and e-commerce, and for white-collar jobs requiring streaming video calls.</p><h2>Nigeria is 129th in the world in Internet speeds</h2><p>Internet speeds across Nigeria vary, but broadband tester Ookla\u2019s spring 2025 median for fixed broadband was 28 megabits per second for downloads and 15 Mb/s for uploads, with latency of 25 milliseconds. That puts Nigeria 129th in the world for fixed broadband. In May, Starlink delivered download speeds between 44 and 50 Mb/s, uploads of around 12 Mb/s, and latency of around 61 ms. The top country, <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/singapore\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore</a>, averaged 393 Mb/s down and 286 Mb/s up, with 4 ms latency.

Local gangs may cut the cables or steal components. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>There are many causes for the slow Internet, but chief among them are frequent cable cuts\u2014<a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/50000-incidents-recorded-in-2024-fg-sets-up-panel-to-address-telecoms-cables-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">50,000 in 2024</a>, according to the federal government. The problem is so bad that in February, the government established a committee to prevent network blackouts due to cable cuts during road construction, which it blamed for 60 percent of the incidents.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is reaching the hinterland,\u201d Aliyu of Phase3 Telecom says, and keeping lines intact once there. To make his point, Aliyu, dressed in a snappy three-piece suit and red tie, drives a company pickup truck from Phase3\u2019s well-appointed offices in a leafy part of Abuja to a nearby ring road. He pulls over in the shade of an overpass and steps onto the dirt shoulder. A concrete manhole cover sits perched along one edge of an open manhole, looking like the lid of a sarcophagus.</p><p>Pointing at the hole, Aliyu explains how easy it is for local gangs, called area boys, to steal components or cut the cables, forcing backbone providers and ISPs to strike unofficial security deals with the boys, or the more powerful, shadowy men behind them. Of course, part of the problem is self-inflicted: Sloppy work crews leave manholes open and expose the cables to potential damage from nesting animals or a stray cigarette butt that ignites tumbleweed and melts the cables.</p><p>Phase3 and other telecom companies are also contending with the expense of replacing the first generation of fiber-optic cables, now about 20 years old, as well as upgrading PoP hardware to increase capacity. They\u2019re spending money not just to reach new customers, but also to provide competitive service to existing customers.</p><p>For mobile operators such as Globacom, there\u2019s the additional challenge of ensuring reliable power for their base stations. They often rely on diesel or gasoline generators to back up grid power, but fuel scarcity, infrastructure theft, and supply chain issues can undermine base station reliability.</p><h2>How Nigeria\u2019s offline half lives</h2><p>The hamlet of <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/553626-special-report-inside-abujas-forgotten-communities-lacking-basic-amenities-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tungan Ashere</a> is 3 km northwest of the major international airport serving Abuja. To get here, you leave the highway and drive past cinder-block huts with traditional reed roofs. The side of the dirt road is adorned with concrete pylons waiting to be strung with power lines but still naked as the day they were installed in 2021. People here farm cassava, watermelon, yam, and corn. Some keep small herds of goats and cattle. To get to market, they can ride on one of a handful of dirt-bike taxis.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a plastic tarp covering a round green structure on a platform, with a group of people gathered inside.

The metal resonates, not quite like a church bell, but it serves a similar purpose. \u201cThe bell, it\u2019s to tell everybody to go to sleep, to wake up, if there\u2019s an announcement. It\u2019s an ancient way of communicating,\u201d explains Lukman Aliu, a telecom engineer who drove me here.</p><p>The concept of connectivity in the village differs from just a few kilometers away at the airport, where passengers can enjoy free high-speed Wi-Fi in the comfort of a caf\u00e9. Yet the potential benefits of affordable broadband access for people living in places like Tungan Ashere are enormous.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usman.isah.5205?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\" target=\"_blank\">Usman Isah Dandari</a> is trying to meet that need. He is a technical assistant at the <a href=\"https://citad.org.ng/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD)</a>, a nonprofit based in Kano, Nigeria. Dandari coordinates a handful of community networking projects, including one in Tungan Ashere. Better broadband here would help farmers track market prices, help students complete their homework, and make it easier for farmers and craftspeople to advertise their goods. CITAD uses a mixture of hardware, including Starlink terminals and cellular modems, to offer relatively reliable broadband to areas neglected by commercial operators. The group is also considering using Nigeria\u2019s national satellite operator, <a href=\"https://nigcomsat.gov.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">NigComSat</a>, and working with the Nigerian Communications Commission to lower the costs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a man in Nigerian garb standing in front of a seated group of mainly children who are looking at tablets.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10785\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-man-in-nigerian-garb-standing-in-front-of-a-seated-group-of-mainly-children-who-are-looking-at-tablets.jpg?id=61426661&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Usman Isah Dandari [standing] coordinates several projects like the one in Tungan Ashere, to provide affordable broadband access.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>A few meters away from the scrap-metal bell in Tungan Ashere is a one-story building painted rust red, topped with a pastel green corrugated metal roof and eight solar panels, which power a computer lab inside. There\u2019s no grid electricity here, but the solar panels are enough to run a CITAD-provided cellular modem, a few desktop computers, and a formidable floor fan some of the time.</p><p>Many of the people in the village once lived where the airport is now. The Nigerian government<a href=\"https://dailytrust.com/the-sad-story-of-communities-displaced-for-abuja-airport/\" target=\"_blank\"> displaced them</a> when it chose the region as the new federal capital territory in 1991. Since then, successive local governments have provided services piecemeal, usually in the runup to elections. The result is a string of communities like Tungan Ashere\u201410,000 people in all\u2014that still lack running water, paved roads, grid electricity, and reliable Internet. These people may live on the edge of Nigeria\u2019s broadband backbone, but they reap few of its benefits.</p><h2>A private undersea cable shows how to do it</h2><p>Not every undersea cable rollout has been fraught. In 2005, electrical engineer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funke_Opeke\" target=\"_blank\">Funke Opeke</a> was working at Verizon Communications in the United States. <a href=\"https://www.mtn.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">MTN</a>, an African telecom company, hired her to help it build its submarine cables. Then Nitel hired her to help manage its privatization. There, she saw up close how the organization was failing to get the Internet from SAT-3 into Nigerians\u2019 lives.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a woman seated at a table with her hands folded in front of her.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3565a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-woman-seated-at-a-table-with-her-hands-folded-in-front-of-her.jpg?id=61426663&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Funke Opeke founded MainOne to build Nigeria\u2019s first private undersea fiber-optic cable.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Osodi/Bloomberg/Getty Images</small></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a question of capital or return on investment, policy, or interest,\u201d Opeke says. Instead, officials favored suppliers offering kickbacks over those with competent bids.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity for a well-managed submarine cable, Opeke approached private investors about developing a cable of their own. The result is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_One\" target=\"_blank\">MainOne cable</a>, which arrived in Lagos in 2010 and is operated by the company of the same name. MainOne offered the first private competition to Nitel\u2019s SAT-3 and Globacom\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLO-1\" target=\"_blank\">Glo-1</a>, which began service in 2010. (MTN\u2019s two cables landed in Nigeria in 2011.)</p><p>At first, the MainOne cable suffered the same problem as the others\u2014its capacity wasn\u2019t reaching users. \u201cAfter we built, there was no distribution,\u201d Opeke, who\u2019s now an advisor with MainOne, says. So the company got its own ISP license and began building fiber links into major metro areas\u2014eventually <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/04/equinix-enters-africa-closing-the-us-320-million-acquisition-of-mainone\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,200 km</a> in states near its undersea-cable landing site. It ended up offering a more complete service than originally intended, bringing the Internet from overseas, onshore, across Nigeria, and the last kilometers into businesses and homes, and it attracted more than 800 business clients.</p><p>MainOne\u2019s success forced the publicly held telecoms and the mobile providers to compete. \u201cThe mobile networks were built for voice, and they were not investing fast enough\u201d in data capacity, Opeke says. MainOne did invest, helping to create the broadband capacity needed for Nigeria\u2019s first data centers. It then diversified into data centers, and in 2022 sold its whole business to American data-center giant <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Equinix</a>.</p><p>Other companies, including the major mobile operators, also began building fiber between Nigerian cities, duplicating each other\u2019s infrastructure. The problem is they didn\u2019t offer competitive prices to independent ISPs that wanted to piggyback on those new fiber-optic links, says the telecom analyst Odufuwa.</p><p>And neither the public sector nor the private sector is meeting the needs of Nigerians at the bottom of the market, especially in rural communities such as Tungan Ashere and Atan. A crucial first step will be to improve the reliability of the electrical grid, Opeke says, which will help drive down costs for telecom operators and other businesses, and create a virtuous cycle for further growth.</p><p>Almost everyone <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> interviewed for this story said security is another challenge: If Nigerian states and the federal government could ensure the security of the infrastructure, telecom operators would invest more in expanding their networks. Building telecom infrastructure is well within the reach of Nigerian engineers. \u201cNigeria doesn\u2019t have a skill problem,\u201d Opeke says. \u201cIt has an opportunity problem.\u201d</p><p>If the bureaucrats, businesspeople, and engineers can overcome those policy and technical hurdles, the unconnected half of Nigerians stand to gain a lot. Reliable broadband in Atan would draw more young people to agriculture, says the farmer and sociologist Bolaji Adeniyi: \u201cIt will provide jobs.\u201d Then, like Adeniyi, maybe those young connected Nigerians will reconsider whether farming is just father\u2019s work\u2014perhaps it could be their future, too. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Special thanks to IEEE Senior Member John Funso-Adebayo for his assistance with the logistics and reporting for this story. </em></p>"

Graphite is composed of stacked layers of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/paragraf-graphene-foundry\" target=\"_blank\">graphene</a>, a single-atom-thick sheet of carbon atoms arranged in repeating hexagonal rings. Now add pentagons, septagons, and octagons of carbon atoms into the sheet, and you\u2019re looking at a <a href=\"https://news.nus.edu.sg/new-material-sharpens-proton-beams-boosting-cancer-treatment/\" target=\"_blank\">new form of ultra-thin carbon</a> that promises to sharpen <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/engineers-unveil-particle-accelerator-on-a-chip\" target=\"_blank\">beams of subatomic particles</a> used in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/fighting-cancer-with-protons\" target=\"_blank\">proton therapy</a>.</p><p>Ultra-thin foils of carbon materials have been used for decades in proton therapy to filter particles into high-precision beams meant to kill tumors. But, they take time to make and often contain impurities from the manufacturing process that lower the precision of the beam. In research described in <a href=\"https://www-nature-com.yale.idm.oclc.org/articles/s41565-025-01968-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Nature Nanotechnology,</em></em></a> <a href=\"https://chemistry.nus.edu.sg/people/lu-jiong/\" target=\"_blank\">Jiong Lu</a> and his <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01968-3#author-information\" target=\"_blank\">colleagues at National University of Singapore and in China</a> developed a technique that can grow a 200-millimeter sheet of a new kind of ultra-thin carbon material in just three seconds, with no detectable impurities.</p><p>Proton therapy is a non-invasive radiation treatment in which hydrogen ions are accelerated through a cyclotron to form a high-energy beam used to destroy DNA in tumors. In a cyclotron, an electromagnetic field accelerates ions of molecular hydrogen, which spiral outward as they pick up speed. They then strike a carbon foil that strips away the hydrogen\u2019s electrons, leaving protons that exit the machine as a high-energy beam. Proton therapy is often preferred as a treatment because of its precision. The sharp beam eliminates tumors while preserving healthy tissue. The new carbon promises an even sharper and more energy-intense beam, potentially making the treatment more potent.</p><p>The benefits of the new material, called ultra-clean monolayer amorphous carbon (UC-MAC), are derived from its disordered ring structure, which contrasts with the perfect hexagonal rings in graphene. The structures present in UC-MAC create tiny pores in the material that are only one tenth of a nanometer wide. The researchers have found a way to fine-tune these angstrom-scale pores to control how the material filters hydrogen ions, in order to produce proton beams with less scattering.</p><h2>Nanograins and Nanopores</h2><p>The new technique starts with depositing a thin film of copper on top of a sapphire wafer inside a chamber filled with high-density plasma. Depending on the temperature of the copper and the rate at which it\u2019s deposited, irregular crystals a couple dozen nanometers in size called nanograins form. The nanograins provide the right conditions for UC-MAC to grow, and eventually, a complete layer of the atom-thick carbon material crystallizes on top of the copper. This growth happens in just three seconds, more than an order of magnitude faster than previous methods used to grow carbon foils.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/huihui-lin-4a6911281/?originalSubdomain=sg\" target=\"_blank\">Huihui Lin</a>, a research scientist at A*STAR who worked on the project, explains that the synthesis\u2019 rapid speeds come from the high density of the nanograins that form on the copper, and from the plasma in the growth chamber, which provides high quantities of particles that react with the substrate to form the carbon structure. </p><p>Despite its potential importance in cancer treatment though, Lin says that UC-MAC was originally designed with different applications in mind. \u201cWe tried it in electronics and optical devices, and after three years of work, we discovered its unique advantage as a membrane for producing precision proton beams,\u201d he explains.</p><p>Because of the angstrom-sized pores in the material, the team discovered that UC-MAC was uniquely suited to turning molecular hydrogen ions into protons. Accelerating molecular hydrogen ions through the cyclotron instead of already-filtered protons increased the quantity of protons in the beam in a given amount of time, by an order of magnitude. </p><p>Lin thinks it will still take time to get the material to the point of commercialization. He explains that like many other 2D materials, \u201cyou need tens of steps\u201d to grow the carbon on the substrate. So, simplifying the process is crucial to getting closer to commercialization. Eventually though, the material may make proton therapy a more widely available treatment option. \u201cThe UC-MAC makes proton beams more tunable [and] affordable,\u201d says Lin.</p>"

Farmers like Joe are helping to move his country of 237 million people toward self-sufficiency in rice.</p><p>But farmer Joe has a handicap. \u201cFor me, the power grid is a fiction,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t get any electricity from the grid, and I never will.\u201d</p><p>Five years ago, Joe installed solar panels to power his farm\u2019s irrigation system, which draws water from a nearby river. His milling and bagging machines, meanwhile, still run on diesel generators.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 600 million people\u2014about 53 percent\u2014still have <a href=\"https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditccom2023d1_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">no access to electricity</a>. Even this grim statistic understates the problem, because \u201caccess\u201d can mean just enough wattage to illuminate a few LED lightbulbs some of the time. It\u2019s not what Western Europeans or North Americans would consider electricity.</p><p>And <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nigeria-power-grid\" target=\"_self\">traditional power grids in sub-Saharan Africa</a> are hampered by poor reliability and frequent outages. Even when offered electricity, many customers can\u2019t afford to pay, and so theft of service is endemic.

Such a rapid expansion means bringing electricity to an additional 4.2 million people <em><em>every month</em></em> on average.</p><p>While plausible, the expansion faces headwinds, most notably from the sub-Saharan\u2019s net population gain of about 2.5 million people per month. If that population growth continues for all six years of the initiative, there will be an additional 180 million people requiring electricity access.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is large.

(The North African countries aren\u2019t part of the sub-Saharan region, and, except for Libya, have electrification rates of 100 percent.)</p><h2><span>Off-grid solar\u2019s untapped potential in Africa</span></h2><p>Fossil fuels still play a big role in Africa\u2019s power generation. Natural gas is the single largest source of electricity generation, while coal is significant only in South Africa. Together, they account for roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s electricity production, according to BloombergNEF.

UNCTAD estimates that Africa has 60 percent of the world\u2019s best global solar resources. That translates to a solar potential of over 10 terawatts. \u201cOff-grid solar and storage is taking off in a big way,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonia-dunlop-62868354\" target=\"_blank\">Sonia Dunlop</a>, CEO of the <a href=\"https://www.globalsolarcouncil.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Solar Council</a> in London. \u201cThere are already about 600 million people, almost all in sub-Saharan Africa, who use off-grid solar and storage at least once a week.\u201d Dunlop expects to see a 40 percent increase in solar installations next year in the region.</p><p>Off-grid solar power lends itself to bottom-up bootstrapping in rural areas by communities, small farms, businesses, and residential customers. To make the technology more affordable, the expansion of microfinancing will be key, as <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tIEmpwEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Mwoya Byaro</a> and<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nanzia_Mmbaga\" target=\"_blank\"> Nanzia Florent Mmbaga</a> point out in a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227622003209\" target=\"_blank\">2022 study</a> in <em><em>Scientific African</em></em>.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED:<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/offgrid-solars-killer-app\" target=\"_self\"> Off-Grid Solar\u2019s Killer App</a></p><p>I know firsthand the difference off-grid solar can make.

They now illuminate communal areas that were formerly dark at night. The compound and the neighborhood aren\u2019t connected to the grid, though, so for indoor electricity, our relatives still rely on diesel generators.</p><h2>The future of hydropower in sub-Saharan Africa</h2><p>While off-grid solar could bring electricity to millions of people, hydropower is \u201cAfrica\u2019s renewable-electricity powerhouse, largely thanks to excellent resources in the East and Central regions of the continent,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/Africa-Power-Transition-Factbook-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">BloombergNEF reported in 2024</a>.

As with solar, Africa uses only a small fraction of its hydropower potential. Mini hydropower dams from 100 kilowatts to 1 megawatt are important for remote and small communities of around 50 to 500 homes, MacColl says. Large dams are under construction or have been recently completed in Angola, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Zambia.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24668849/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p><span>But constructing hydropower dams is costly and carries the risk of corruption and mismanagement that comes with big projects, as well as the cost of connecting a new power source to the power grid.

But Ghana, which runs a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Research_Reactor-1\" target=\"_blank\">research reactor</a>, is planning its first nuclear power plant with assistance from China, Japan, and the United States. Uganda has chosen a site for its first reactors, as has Kenya. And the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority says it has signed technical agreements on nuclear power with France, India, Russia, and South Korea. But in all these cases, generating electricity from nuclear power is at least a decade away, according to the World Nuclear Association.</p><h2>Kenya\u2019s electrification success story</h2><p> Ultimately, increased access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa will come from a variety of sources. One success story is Kenya, where off-grid electricity, primarily from solar, is complementing expanded grid access. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://idev.afdb.org/sites/default/files/documents/files/IE%20of%20the%20AfDB-supported%20Kenya%20Last%20Mile%20Connectivity%20Project%20Phase%20I%20-%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Last Mile Connectivity Project</a> aims to extend the grid to an additional 280,000 residences, 30,000 businesses, and health centers and schools in all 47 counties, according to the African Development Bank, which helped fund the effort. Previously, the national utility, Kenya Power, succeeded in increasing the number of grid-connected households in the <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/478251467995396760/pdf/106032-BRI-PUBLIC-IMPACT-9-ESMAP-ImpactStory-Kenya-Electrification.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">poorest urban areas</a> from 3,000 to 150,000. Kenya also has the largest wind farm in Africa, the <a href=\"https://ltwp.co.ke/\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Turkana Wind Power Project</a>. The 310-MW plant\u2019s 365 turbines account for about 15 percent of Kenya\u2019s installed electricity capacity.</p><p>These sustained efforts <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinero/2025/05/09/kenya-more-than-doubled-electricity-access-over-a-decade\" target=\"_blank\">doubled Kenya\u2019s electrification access rate</a> between 2013 and 2023 to 79 percent. Kenya Power now aims to achieve <a href=\"https://newsroom.kplc.co.ke/articles/a-total-of-150000-customers-targeted-for-connection-in-a-new-last-mile-connectivity-project\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">universal electricity access by 2030</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Nigeria, the most populous sub-Saharan country, the outlook for electricity access is cloudier. Joe, the Nigerian rice farmer, is considering installing more solar on his farm, to expand his mill. With more electricity, he says, \u201cwe can grow more rice, and mill and bag more for our people.\u201d If the power grid won\u2019t\u2014or can\u2019t\u2014come to him, at least he has the means to generate his own electricity to meet his own needs. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

While we continue to debate whether artificial intelligence (AI) <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/sentient-ai\" target=\"_blank\">can possess consciousness</a>, one thing is certain: AI will experience time differently. Its sense of time will be dictated not by biology, but by its computational, sensory, and communication processes. How will we coexist with an alien intelligence that perceives and acts in a very different temporal world?</p><h2>What Simultaneity Means to a Human</h2><p>Clap your hands while looking at them. You see, hear, and feel the clap as a single multimodal event\u2014the visual, audio, and tactile senses appear simultaneous and define the \u201cnow.\u201d Our consciousness plays out these sensory inputs as simultaneous, although they arrive at different times: Light reaches our eyes faster than sound reaches our ears, while our brain processes audio faster than it does complex visual information. Still, it all feels like one moment.</p><p>That illusion stems from a built-in brain mechanism. The brain defines \u201cnow\u201d through a brief window of time during which multiple sensory perceptions are collected and integrated. This span of time, usually<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2015-07857-001.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> up to few hundreds of milliseconds</a>, is called the temporal window of integration (TWI). As a proxy for this temporal grid, films with 24 frames per second create an illusion of continuous movement.</p><p>But the human TWI has its limits. See a distant lightning flash and you\u2019ll hear the rumble of thunder seconds later. The human TWI evolved to stitch together sensory information only for events within roughly 10 to 15 meters. That\u2019s our horizon of simultaneity.</p><h2>Alien Intelligence in the Physical World</h2><p>AI is poised to become a standard part of robots and other machines that perceive and interact with the physical world. These machines will use sensors hardwired to their bodies, but also remote sensors that send digital data from afar. A robot may receive data from a satellite orbiting 600 km above Earth and treat the data as real-time, as transmission takes only 2 ms\u2014far faster than the human TWI.</p><p>A human\u2019s sensors are \u201chardwired\u201d to the body, which establishes two premises for how the brain interacts with the physical world. First, the propagation delay from each sensor to the brain is predictable. When a sound occurs in the environment, the unpredictable factor is the distance between the sound source and our ears; the time delay from the ears to the brain is fixed. Second, each sensor is used by only one human brain. The human horizon of simultaneity evolved through millions of years under these premises, optimized to help us assess opportunities and threats. A lion at 15 meters was worth worrying about, but thunder at 3 kilometers was likely not.</p><p>These two premises won\u2019t always be valid for intelligent machines with multimodal perception. An AI system may receive data from a remote sensor with unpredictable link delays. And a single sensor can provide data to many different AI modules in real time, like an eye shared by multiple brains. As a result, AI systems will evolve their own perception of space and time and their own horizon of simultaneity, and they\u2019ll change much faster than the glacial pace of human evolution. We will soon coexist with an alien intelligence that has a different perception of time and space.</p><h2>The AI Time Advantage</h2><p>Here\u2019s where things get strange. AI systems are not limited by biological processing speeds and can perceive time with unprecedented precision, discovering cause-and-effect relationships that occur too quickly for human perception.</p><p>In our hyperconnected world, this could lead to wide-scale<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Rashomon effects</a>, where multiple observers give conflicting perspectives on events. (The term comes from a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> classic Japanese film</a> in which several characters describe the same incident in dramatically different ways, each shaped by their own perspective.) </p><p>Imagine a traffic accident in the year 2045 at a busy city intersection, witnessed by three observers: a human pedestrian, an AI system directly connected to street sensors, and a remote AI system receiving the same sensory data over a digital link. The human simply perceives a robot entering the road just before a car crashes into it. The local AI, with immediate sensor access, records the precise order: the robot moving first, then the car braking, then the collision. Meanwhile, the remote AI\u2019s perception is skewed by communication delays, perhaps logging the braking before it perceives the robot stepping into the road. Each perspective offers a different sequence of cause and effect. Which witness will be considered credible, a human or a machine? And which machine? </p><p>People with malicious intent could even use high-powered AI systems to fabricate \u201cevents\u201d using generative AI, and could insert them in the overall flow of events perceived by less capable machines. Humans equipped with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/augmented-reality\" target=\"_blank\">extended-reality interfaces</a> might be especially vulnerable to such manipulations, as they\u2019d be continuously taking in digital sensory data.</p><p>If the sequence of events is distorted, it can disrupt our sense of causality, potentially disrupting time-critical systems such as emergency response, financial trading, or autonomous driving. People could even use AI systems capable of predicting events milliseconds before they occur to confuse and confound. If an AI system predicted an event and transmitted false data at precisely the right moment, it could create a false appearance of causality. For example, an AI that could predict movements of the stock market could publish a fabricated news alert just before an anticipated sell-off.</p><h2>Computers Put Timestamps, Nature Does Not</h2><p>The engineer\u2019s instinct might be to solve the problem with digital timestamps on sensory data. However, timestamps require precise clock synchronization, which requires more power than many small devices can handle.</p><p>And even if sensory data is timestamped, communication or processing delays may cause it to arrive too late for an intelligent machine to act on the data in real time. Imagine an industrial robot in a factory tasked with stopping a machine if a worker gets too close. Sensors detect a worker\u2019s movement and a warning signal\u2014including a timestamp\u2014travels over the network. But there\u2019s an unexpected network hiccup and the signal arrives after 200 milliseconds, so the robot acts too late to prevent an accident. The timestamps don\u2019t make communication delays predictable, but they can help to reconstruct what went wrong after the fact.</p><p>Nature, of course, does not put timestamps on events. We infer temporal flow and causality by comparing the arrival times of event data and integrating it with the brain\u2019s model of the world.</p><p>Albert Einstein\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/einstein-states-his-theory-special-relativity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> special theory of relativity</a> noted that simultaneity depends on the observer\u2019s frame of reference and can vary with motion. However, it also showed that the causal order of events, the sequence in which causes lead to effects, remains consistent for all observers. Not so for intelligent machines. Because of unpredictable communication delays and variable processing times, intelligent machines may perceive events in a different causal order altogether.</p><p>In 1978,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Leslie Lamport</a> addressed this issue for distributed computing, introducing logical clocks to determine \u201chappened before\u201d relation among digital events. To adapt this approach to the intersection of the physical and digital worlds, we must grapple with unpredictable delays between a real-world event and its digital timestamp.</p><p>This crucial tunneling from the physical to the digital world happens at specific access points: a digital device or sensor, WiFi routers, satellites, and base stations. As individual devices or sensors can be hacked fairly easily, the responsibility for maintaining accurate and trustworthy information about time and causal order will fall increasingly on large digital infrastructure nodes.</p><p>This vision aligns with developments within 6G, the forthcoming wireless standard. In 6G, base stations will not only relay information, they will also sense their environments. These future base stations must become trustworthy gateways between the physical and the digital worlds. Developing such technologies could prove essential as we enter an unpredictable future shaped by rapidly evolving alien intelligences.</p>"
