        "summary": "U.S. laws make it illegal for employers to knowingly hire undocumented migrants. This legal constraint affects which firms will employ unauthorized workers and what jobs undocumented migrants can expect to get. As a result, unauthorized migrants are more likely to end up in jobs that have a lower risk of detection of immigration status and are less desirable. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which began in August 2012, gave temporary legal authorization to work in the U.S. to a subset of undocumented migrants \u2013 those who arrived in the U.S. as children meeting certain other eligibility criteria. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the effect of DACA on the occupational outcomes of young adults who arrived in the U.S. as children. Applying this strategy to individual-level data from the American Community Survey, we find that DACA eligibility decreases the likelihood that noncitizen childhood immigrants hold traditional immigrant jobs or jobs with a high risk of injury, and increases the likelihood of holding a government job or jobs that require occupational licensing. On the whole, DACA eligibility shifts noncitizen childhood immigrants to occupations that are higher-paying and employ more educated workers. These findings are consistent with legal barriers constraining undocumented childhood migrants from taking the jobs they are interested in and have the skills for. These workers are shunted to jobs they find less desirable and there are societal losses from the misallocation of talent."

        "summary": "Science has long been concentrated in the Western world, but the global research landscape is undergoing a profound reorganization. Using data on 44 million publications from 1980 to 2022, we document the geography of science in terms of who produces it, what it studies, and where it diffuses. The share of publications produced in the United States has fallen from 40% in 1980 to 15% in 2022, while China\u2019s share has risen from near-zero to 32%. This pattern extends even to elite outlets, with China now producing over 35% of top-journal publications. Notably, this is driven not only by an expanding researcher base but also\u2014to a large extent\u2014by increases in individual productivity. This growth varies by fields: China leads in the Engineering and Physical Sciences (such as Chemistry), while the US retains its lead in Biomedical and Health Sciences. Moreover, China\u2019s expanding leadership in scientific production has not translated into a commensurate shift in global diffusion and integration. Elite research remains disproportionately focused on US topics (40% of breakthrough publications), and citations to Chinese research disproportionately come from within China rather than from other regions, even for top-tier science. Similar to China, other middle- and low-income countries (including India, Russia, and Brazil) have also expanded output producing as much research as high-income European Union countries combined (about 21% overall) but they remain underrepresented in top-tier journals. Overall, our findings highlight both the democratization and fragmentation of global science, raising important questions about the future of the global scientific enterprise."

        "summary": "This paper presents the first direct test of two interlinked predictions at the core of the monopsony theory of the labor market: (i) that firms exploit wage-setting power by marking down wages below the marginal revenue product of labor, and (ii) that exogenous wage constraints, if binding, eliminate markdowns. Our research design revisits the 2015 introduction of a high minimum wage in Germany. Drawing on a monopsony model, we derive an empirically tractable difference-in-differences specification that provides a quantitative benchmark for the firm-level markdown response. Our main result is that empirical markdowns respond only 0\u201325% as much as the monopsony model would have predicted. Hence, at least for the labor market segment we study, (i) markdowns largely reflect other distortions than monopsony, (ii) markdowns are mismeasured, (iii) minimum wages induce widespread labor shortages, or (iv) the standard monopsony model does not provide a full, realistic account of the labor market."

        "summary": "This paper quantifies aggregate productivity in general equilibrium economies where agents with heterogeneous preferences make discrete choices between locations and occupations. We show how the conventional tools of welfare economics, like cost-benefit analysis, can be extended to these settings. Following Debreu (1951), we measure the change in aggregate productivity as the maximum reduction in total factor productivity such that it is possible to make every household at least indifferent to their status quo allocation. Aggregate productivity rises if primary factors can be saved while keeping every household at least indifferent. We characterize this measure of efficiency in terms of compensated supply and demand curves. We show that, to a first-order approximation, the elasticity of aggregate productivity to productivity shocks is given by sales shares (regardless of preferences and technologies). We also provide second-order approximations in terms of elasticities of uncompensated supply and demand curves. We contrast our approach with some popular alternative measures of aggregate efficiency and welfare: real GDP, the cross-sectional average of utilities, and the sum of compensating variations, and show that these alternative measures have serious flaws."

        "summary": "We study the labor market effects of tenure-dependent severance pay systems that tie firing costs to workers\u2019 accumulated earnings histories. We develop an overlapping-generations search-and-matching model in which firms face increasing separation costs over the employment relationship. Using administrative employer\u2013employee data from Brazil, we estimate the model and show that tenure-dependent severance costs induce labor hoarding among low-productivity, long-tenured workers who would not be hired if unemployed. These distortions are strongest late in the life cycle, when firms optimally delay separation to avoid severance obligations, while simultaneously imposing higher hiring thresholds on older unemployed workers with shorter continuation values. These forces imply that tenure-based severance policies protect employment histories rather than productivity, shaping labor market dynamics over the life cycle and generating allocative inefficiencies."

Using a regression discontinuity approach, we compare students whose placement exam scores are just above and just below the elite admission threshold. We find that five and ten years after the admission exam, marginally admitted students are less likely to be employed in the formal private sector, and, if employed, they earn lower wages. However, these employment and wage gaps close after 15 years. Moreover, we find that marginal admission to elite high schools leads to delayed entry into the formal labor market, and, at least in the short run, students in elite high schools seem to sort into lower-productivity firms and industries."

That\u2019s especially true in California\u2014the <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/04/23/california-is-now-the-4th-largest-economy-in-the-world/\">world\u2019s fourth-largest economy</a> and the state with the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">largest population</a>.</p><p>While President Donald Trump dismantles U.S. climate policies and federal oversight, California and the European Union have  moved in the opposite direction, becoming the de facto regulators for global businesses.</p><p><span>California\u2019s newly enacted climate laws </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB1207\" target=\"_blank\">extend its cap-and-trade program</a><span>, now called \u201ccap and invest,\u201d which is designed to ratchet down corporate emissions. They also lock in binding targets to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. And they set clean-power levels that rival the </span><a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\" target=\"_blank\">European Union\u2019s Green Deal</a><span> and outpace most national governments.</span></p><p>Other states have joined California in committing to meet the goals of the international Paris climate agreement as part of the <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/press-releases/2024-annual-report-oct-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Climate Alliance</a>. The <a href=\"https://usclimatealliance.org/members/\" target=\"_blank\">bipartisan coalition of 24 governors</a>, from Arizona to Vermont, represents over half of the U.S. population.</p><p></p><p>Several states have been <a href=\"https://www.quorum.us/spreadsheet/external/xfFTMjAKXRGVTRlQOeOI/\">considering \u201cpolluters pay\u201d laws</a>. These laws would require companies to pay for their contributions to climate change, with the money going into funds for adaptation projects. <a href=\"https://ncel.net/articles/polluters-pay-how-states-are-filling-the-federal-climate-funding-gap-in-2025/\">Vermont and New York passed</a> similar laws in 2024.</p><h2>Climate laws still apply in Europe and elsewhere</h2><p>Outside the U.S., several countries have climate regulations that multinational companies must follow.</p><p>The European Union remains a primary driver, though i<span>t has recently recalibrated its </span><span><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0324_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>approach</span></a></span> to focus on the largest corporations, reducing the administrative burden on smaller firms. The EU\u2019s broader \u201c<span><a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/fit-for-55/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Fit for 55</span></a></span><span>\u201d framework aims to cut its emissions by 55 percent by 2030 through policies like binding </span><span><a href=\"https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en\" target=\"_blank\"><span>climate reporting rules</span></a></span><span>. Most notably, the </span><span><a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en\" target=\"_blank\"><span>carbon tax for goods entering the EU</span></a></span> has, as of January 2026, transitioned from a reporting exercise into a direct financial liability\u2014a shift supported by <span><a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/green-deal-industrial-plan_en\" target=\"_blank\"><span>initiatives to boost competitiveness</span></a></span> in clean energy and green infrastructure.</p><p>Beyond Europe, companies face similar emissions reporting requirements in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-enshrine-mandatory-climate-disclosures-for-largest-companies-in-law\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/mandatory-climate-related-financial-disclosures/\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sgx.com/sustainable-finance/sustainability-reporting\">Singapore</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/exxon-apple-and-other-corporate-giants-will-have-to-disclose-all-their-emissions-under-californias-new-climate-laws-that-will-have-a-global-impact-214630\">California</a>, and cities such as <a href=\"https://www.sfc.hk/en/Rules-and-standards/Securities-and-Futures-Ordinance-Part-XV---Disclosure-of-Interests\">Hong Kong</a>.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">While companies can pause their storytelling, they must still invest in the hard data infrastructure required to count their carbon.</p><p><span>While timelines for some of those laws have shifted, the underlying momentum remains. For example, while California temporarily halted a law requiring companies to publish narrative reports on their climate risks (SB 261), the mandate for hard emissions data (SB 253) remains on track for 2026. This \u201cquantitative yes, qualitative maybe\u201d status means that while companies can pause their storytelling, they must still invest in the hard data infrastructure required to count their carbon.</span></p><p><span></span><span>The</span><span> </span><span>International Court of Justice gave legal backing to such initiatives in July 2025 when it  </span>issued an <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/case/187\">advisory opinion</a> establishing that countries around the globe have a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-world-court-just-ruled-countries-can-be-held-liable-for-climate-change-damage-what-does-that-mean-for-the-us-262272\">legal obligation to protect the climate</a>. That decision may ultimately increase pressure on global businesses to reduce their contributions to climate change.</p><h2>Multinationals put pressure on supply chains</h2><p>Multinational companies\u2019 efforts to reduce their climate impact puts pressure on their suppliers\u2014meaning many more companies must take their climate impact into consideration.</p><p>For instance, U.S.-based Walmart operates over 10,000 stores across <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/about/location-facts\">19 countries</a> and is the largest single buyer of goods in the world. That means it faces a wide range of regulations, including tracking and reducing emissions from its suppliers. In 2017, it launched Project Gigaton, aiming to cut 1 gigaton of supply-chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Suppliers including Nestle, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Hanes helped the company <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/02/21/walmart-suppliers-lead-the-charge-help-deliver-project-gigaton-goal-more-than-six-years-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reach its target six years early</a> through practical measures such as boosting energy efficiency, redesigning packaging, and reducing food waste. <span>While the data is verified through internal quality controls co-developed with NGOs like the Environmental Defense Fund, analysts at </span><span><a href=\"https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CTA100-Walmart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Planet Tracker</a></span> note that these \u201cavoided\u201d emissions haven\u2019t yet stopped Walmart\u2019s absolute footprint from rising alongside its business growth.</p><p><span>In early 2025, this growth led Walmart to </span><span><a href=\"https://trellis.net/article/walmart-2025-esg-update/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>push back its interim deadlines</span></a></span> for two of its most ambitious emissions-reduction targets. Despite these delays, Walmart\u2019s \u201cemissions intensity\u201d\u2014the carbon produced per dollar of revenue\u2014has <span><a href=\"https://www.csofutures.com/news/walmart-warns-it-will-miss-2025-and-2030-targets-as-sales-growth-push-up-emissions/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>fallen by roughly 47 percent</span></a></span> over the past decade. Moreover<span>, </span>almost half of its electricity worldwide came from renewable energy in 2024, its emissions per unit of revenue fell, and it is still targeting zero emissions from its operations by 2040.</p><h2>There are profits to be made in clean tech</h2><p>In addition to facing pressure from buyers and governments, companies see profits to be made from investing in climate-friendly clean technology.</p><p>Since 2016, investments in clean energy have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/energy-environment/trump-renewable-energy-batteries.html\">outpaced that of fossil fuels</a> globally. This trend has only hastened, with nearly twice as much invested in clean energy as fossil fuels in 2025.</p><p></p><p>Lately, myriad <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00743-7\">new business opportunities</a> for multinational companies and startups alike have focused on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/amazon-sustainability-officers-ai-tool-climate-change/\">meeting AI\u2019s energy demand</a> through clean energy.</p><p>From 2014 to 2024, the climate tech sector yielded total <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/q1-2025/\">returns of nearly 200 percent</a>, and U.S. investment in climate tech was <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">still growing in 2025</a>.</p><p>In the first half of 2025, <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">close to one-fifth</a> of the more than 1,600 venture deals in climate tech were made by corporations for strategic reasons, such as technology access, supply chain integration, or future product offerings. <span>Corporate strategic deals continued to represent about </span><a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NZI_2025-State-of-Climate-Tech-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>20 to 23 percent</span></a> of all climate tech equity transactions through the third and fourth quarters of 2025.</p><p><span>However, this surge in investment is more than a search for profit; it is a defensive necessity as the tech industry\u2019s growth begins to collide with its environmental limits.</span></p><h2>The AI energy paradox</h2><p><span>The rapid expansion of AI is forcing multinational companies to make explicit choices about their climate priorities. While tech leaders once relied on annual renewable credits to meet climate targets, the scale of the AI power boom is forcing more rigorous carbon accounting. Global data centers are </span><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai\" target=\"_blank\"><span>projected</span></a> to consume more electricity than Japan by 2030, a shift that turns \u201cvoluntary\u201d climate investments into a core business requirement for securing 24/7 energy supplies.</p><p><span>In 2025, the tech giants\u2019 own reports revealed the scale of AI emissions. Microsoft\u2019s 2025 Environmental Sustainability Report revealed a 23.4 percent </span><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/29/environmental-sustainability-report/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>increase</span></a> in total emissions since its 2020 baseline. Similarly, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2025-environmental-report/\">emissions have climbed 51 percent since 2019</a>, with a 22 percent surge in Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions in 2024 alone. <span>Amazon\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2024-report\" target=\"_blank\"><span>2024 Sustainability Report</span></a> noted a 33 percent jump since 2019 driven by the construction of new data centers. Meta\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2025-sustainability-report/\">supplier\u2019s emissions (99 percent of its total footprint) are being driven to new heights</a> by the \u201cembodied carbon\u201d of AI hardware.</p><p><span>While high costs might tempt some to cut corners, climate action could instead become a hedge against energy volatility. C</span>ompanies like Amazon and Google are securing reliable supply by leveraging <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\">federal fast-tracking of nuclear permits</a> to act as primary offtakers for the first generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). <span>This shift is accelerated by new federal orders to bypass nuclear licensing hurdles, as seen in Google\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/google-and-kairos-power-team-up-for-smr-deployments-in-us-first\" target=\"_blank\"><span>landmark agreement with Kairos Power</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/amazon-invests-in-x-energy-unveils-smr-project-plans\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Amazon\u2019s $500 million investment in X-energy</span></a><span>\u2014deals designed to secure the 24/7 \u201cbaseload\u201d power AI requires without abandoning carbon-free commitments. Despite their advanced designs, SMRs are still provoking </span><span></span>debate over their <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2111833119\" target=\"_blank\">radioactive waste</a> and the potential risks of deploying nuclear technology <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/25/2025-18633/regulatory-guide-emergency-response-planning-and-preparedness-for-nuclear-power-reactors\" target=\"_blank\">closer to populated industrial hubs</a>.</p><h2>Companies look to their customers and the future</h2><p>As climate risks grow alongside political headwinds, companies are facing both pushes toward and pulls away from protecting the planet from catastrophic effects. Oil and gas companies, for example, <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/oil-and-gas-investment-is-more-important-than-ever\">continue to invest</a> in new oil and gas development. However, they also forecast <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/all-energy-types-are-needed\">renewable energy growth accelerating</a> and are investing in clean tech.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6016/chapter/5709986/Consumer-Facing-and-Carbon-Intensive-Sectors-A\">corporate leaders I interviewed</a>, from tech companies like Intel to sporting goods and apparel companies like Adidas, talked about aligning sustainability efforts and initiatives across their business globally whenever possible. This proactive approach allows them to more seamlessly collect data and respond to pressures arising domestically and globally, minimizing the need for costly patchwork efforts later. Moreover, global businesses know they will continue to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/feliciajackson/2025/11/07/international-standards-could-turn-net-zero-into-common-practice/\">face demands</a> from their customers, investors, and employees to be better stewards of the planet.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges</p><p><span>In a 2025 Getty Images </span><a href=\"http://reports.gettyimages.com/VisualGPS-Visualizing-Sustainability-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>survey</span></a> of over 5,000 consumers across 25 countries, more than 80 percent of respondents reported that they expect clear ESG guidelines from businesses. Furthermore, these consumers\u2014from Brazil, Australia, and Japan to the U.K. and U.S.\u2014are increasingly using GenAI-driven shopping assistants to filter for \u201cresponsible business\u201d practices.</p><p><span>U.S. market </span><a href=\"https://www.hartman-group.com/reports/274144747/sustainability-2025-do-consumers-care\" target=\"_blank\"><span>research</span></a> from the Hartman Group corroborates this trend<span>: 71 percent of surveyed food and beverage consumers consider environmental and social impacts in their purchasing decisions.

The divergence between federal deregulation in Washington and the rigid physical demands of the AI revolution has created a new era of corporate pragmatism. While some firms may use political shifts to \u201cgreenhush\u201d or delay abstract pledges, the world\u2019s largest corporations are finding that they cannot simply account away the massive energy and infrastructure requirements of the AI Age. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges. In this new landscape, the global businesses that thrive will be those that build carbon-free foundations, while responding to existing and future laws across the globe.</span></p><p><em>This article is adapted by the author from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2016, she decided to attend Lehigh, where she earned a full scholarship to its master\u2019s program in civil engineering.</p><h2>Moving abroad and working the rails</h2><p>Her master\u2019s thesis focused on investigating root causes of crack propagation, which threatens railroad safety.</p><p>Repeated wheel-rail loading causes microcracks, leading to metal fatigue, and residual stress results from specialized heating and cooling treatments during the manufacturing of steel rails. Cracks can develop beneath the rail\u2019s surface. Because they\u2019re invisible to the naked eye, such fractures are challenging to detect, Kizildemir says.</p><p>The project was done in collaboration with the U.S. <a href=\"https://railroads.dot.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Railroad Administration</a>\u2014part of the <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Transportation</a>\u2014which is looking to adjust technical standards and employ mitigation strategies.</p><p>Kizildemir and five colleagues designed and implemented testing protocols and physics-based simulations to detect cracks earlier and prevent their spread. Their research has given the Railroad Administration insights into structural defects that are being used to revise rail-building guidelines and inspection protocols. The administration published the <a href=\"https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/76534\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first phase</a> of the research in 2024.</p><p>After graduating in 2018, Kizildemir began a summer internship as a civil engineer at Thornton Tomasetti. She conducted computational modeling using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abaqus</a> software for rails subjected to repeated plastic deformation\u2014material that permanently changes shape when under excessive stress\u2014and presented her recommendations for improvement to the company\u2019s management.</p><p>During her internship, she worked with professors in different fields, including materials behavior and mechanical engineering. The experience, she says, inspired her to pursue a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh, continuing her research with the Railroad Administration. She earned her degree in 2023.</p><p>She loved the work and the team at Thornton Tomasetti so much, she says, that she applied to work at the company, where she is now a project engineer.</p><h2>From simulations to real-world applications</h2><p>Her work focuses on developing finite element models for critical infrastructure and extreme events.</p><p>Finite modeling breaks complex systems or topics into small elements connected together to numerically simulate real-world situations. She creates computational models of structures enduring realistic catastrophic events, such as a vehicle crashing into a building.</p><p>She uses simulations to understand how buildings react to attacks such as the one on 9/11, which, she says, is often used as an example of why such research is essential.</p><p>When starting a project, she and her team review building standards and try to identify new issues not yet covered by them. The team then adapts existing codes and standards, usually developed for well-understood hazards such as earthquakes, wind, and floods, to define simulation parameters.</p><p>When a new structure is being built, for example, it is not designed to withstand a truck crashing into it. But Kizildemir and her team want to know how the building would react should that happen. They simulate the environments and situations, and they make recommendations based on the results to reduce or eliminate risks of structural failure.</p><p>Mitigation suggestions include specific strategies to be implemented during project design and construction.</p><p>Simulations can be created for any infrastructure, Kizildemir says.</p><p>\u201cI love problems that force me to think differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to keep growing.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to live by Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s internal motto: \u201cWhen others say no, we say \u2018Here\u2019s how.\u2019\u201d</p><h2>Joining IEEE and getting more involved</h2><p>When Kizildemir first heard of IEEE, she assumed it was only for electrical engineers. But after learning how diverse and inclusive the organization is, she joined in 2024. She has since been elevated to a senior member and has become a volunteer. She joined the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMTEM014\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society</a>.</p><p>She chaired the conference tracks and IEEE-sponsored sessions at the 2024 <a href=\"https://event.asme.org/Joint-Rail-Conference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Rail Conference</a>, held in Columbia, S.C. She actively contributes to IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Collabratec platform</a> and has participated in panel review meetings for senior member elevation applications.</p><p>She\u2019s also a member of <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASME</a> and has been volunteering for it since 2023.</p><p>\u201cCommunity is what helped get me to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward and make the field better,\u201d she says. \u201cHelping others improves ourselves.\u201d</p><h2>Looking ahead and giving back</h2><p>Kizildemir mentors junior engineers at Thornton Thomasetti and is looking to expand her reach through <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/mentoring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE\u2019s mentorship programs</a>.</p><p>\u201cEngineering doesn\u2019t have a gender requirement,\u201d she says she tells girls. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious and like understanding how things work and get excited to solve difficult problems, engineering is for you.</p><p>\u201cCivil engineers don\u2019t just build bridges,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere are countless niche areas to be explored. Engineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.\u201d</p><p>Kizildemir says she wants every engineer to be able to improve their community. Her main piece of advice for recent engineering graduates is that \u201ccuriosity, discipline, and the willingness to understand things deeply, to see how things can be done better,\u201d are the keys to success.</p>"

It began on an overcrowded fishing boat in 1979 when he was fleeing Vietnam after the war, when survival as one of the country\u2019s \u201cboat people\u201d depended on endurance, luck, and the fragile reliability of a vessel never meant to carry so many lives. Like thousands of others, he fled from his war-torn country after the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Fall-of-Saigon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fall of Saigon</a>, which was controlled by communist North Vietnamese forces.</p><p>To mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon in 1975, Pham and his son Hoang Jr.\u2014a Rutgers computer science graduate turned filmmaker\u2014produced <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rSqNQqxkU-o?si=e3F8yW28hLfQV-a0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Unstoppable Hope</em></em></a>, a documentary about Vietnam\u2019s boat people. The film tells the stories of a dozen refugees who, like Pham, survived perilous escapes and went on to build successful lives in the United States.</p><h2>Growing up during the Vietnam War</h2><p>Pham was born in <a href=\"https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/binh-thuan-much-more-white-sand-golden-sunshine-and-blue-sea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn</a><strong>,</strong> Vietnam. His parents had only a little formal education, having grown up in the 1930s, when schooling was rare. To support their eight children, his parents ran a factory making bricks by hand. Despite their limited means, his parents held an unshakable belief that education was the surest path to a better life.</p><p>From an early age, Pham gravitated toward mathematics. Computers were scarce, but numbers and logic came naturally to him. He imagined becoming a teacher or professor and gradually began thinking about how mathematics could be applied to practical problems\u2014how abstract reasoning might improve daily life.</p><p>His intellectual curiosity unfolded amid frequent danger. He grew up during the Vietnam War, when dodging gunfire in his province was routine. The<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/tet-offensive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 1968 Tet Offensive</a> exposed the full scale of the conflict, making it clear that violence was not an interruption to life but a condition of it.</p><p>Pham recalls that after the<a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/april-30/south-vietnam-surrenders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Communist takeover of South Vietnam</a> in 1975, conditions worsened dramatically. Families without ties to the new government, especially those who operated small businesses, found it increasingly dangerous to work, study, or apply for jobs, he says. People began vanishing. Many attempted to escape by boat, knowing the risks: imprisonment if caught or potentially death at sea.</p><h2>A successful escape</h2><p>In June 1979, at the height of Vietnam\u2019s typhoon season, Pham\u2019s mother made an agonizing decision. She placed Pham, then 18 years old, onto a small, overcrowded fishing vessel in the hope that he might reach freedom.</p><p>The boat, which was designed to carry about 100 people, departed with 275.</p><p>Pham\u2019s 12-day journey was harrowing. He was confined to the lower deck, which was packed so tightly that movement was nearly impossible. Seasickness overwhelmed many passengers, and he remembers losing consciousness shortly after departure. Food was scarce, and safe drinking water was nearly nonexistent. Violent storms battered the vessel, and pirates loomed.</p><p>\u201cEvery moment felt like a struggle against nature, fate, and internal despair,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>The boat eventually washed ashore on a remote island off the Malaysian coast. Arriving at a refugee camp offered little relief; food and clean water were scarce, disease spread rapidly, and nearly everyone\u2014including Pham\u2014contracted malaria. Death came almost nightly.</p><p>After two weeks, Malaysian authorities transferred the refugees to a transit camp, where the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a> provided basic rations. Still, the asylum seekers\u2019 futures remained uncertain. It is estimated by the U.N. <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/about-unhcr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Refugee Agency</a> that between 1975 and the early 1990s, roughly 800,000 Vietnamese people attempted to escape by boat. As many as 250,000 did not survive the harrowing journey, the agency estimates.</p><h2>Starting over with nothing</h2><p>In January 1980, at age 19, Pham learned that someone in the United States had agreed to sponsor him for entry, he says. He soon boarded an airplane for the first time and landed in Seattle.</p><p>His troubles weren\u2019t over, however. He arrived in a city blanketed by snow, wearing thin clothing and carrying only a spare shirt. The frosty weather was not his greatest concern, though. During his first two months, he spent most of his time in a hospital, recovering from malaria and other diseases. And he spoke no English.</p><p>Still, Pham\u2014who had been a first-year college student in Vietnam\u2014refused to abandon his goal of becoming a teacher, he says. He enrolled at<a href=\"https://lincolnhs.seattleschools.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Lincoln High School</a> in order to gain English proficiency and position himself to enter an American college. One teacher allowed him to test into a calculus class despite his limited English\u2014which he passed.</p><p>\u201cThat moment told me I could survive here,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>Within months, he learned he could attend college on a scholarship. He moved to Chicago in August 1980 to study at the<a href=\"https://nl.edu/national-college-of-education/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> National College of Education</a>, then he transferred to<a href=\"https://www.neiu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Northeastern Illinois University</a>, also in Chicago, earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and computer science in 1982.</p><p>Encouraged by mentors, he earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics at the<a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Illinois</a> at Urbana-Champaign in 1984, followed by a Ph.D. in reliability engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.buffalo.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">State University of New York at Buffalo</a> in 1989.</p><h2>When failure is not an option</h2><p>Pham\u2019s research direction crystallized in 1988 while searching for a dissertation topic. He was reading the January 1988 issue of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"> <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a> and had a flash of inspiration after seeing a classified ad posted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Defense Department</a>\u2019s Naval Underwater System Center (now known as the <a href=\"https://tethys.pnnl.gov/organization/naval-undersea-warfare-center-nuwc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Naval Undersea Warfare Center</a>). The ad asked, \u201cCan your theories solve the unsolvable?\u201d It focused on the reliability of undersea communication and combat decision-making systems.</p><p>The ad revealed to him that institutions were actively applying mathematics and statistics to solve engineering problems. Pham says he still keeps a copy of that <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> issue in his office.</p><p>After completing his Ph.D., he joined<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing</a> as a senior specialist engineer at its Renton, Wash., facility, working on engine reliability for the<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/commercial/777\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 777</a> aircraft, which was under development.</p><p>He worked there for 18 months, then accepted a senior engineering specialist position at the<a href=\"https://inl.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Idaho National Laboratory</a>, in Idaho Falls, where he worked on nuclear systems.</p><p>His desire to become an instructor never left him, however. In 1993 he joined Rutgers as an assistant professor of industrial and systems engineering.</p><p>Today his research focuses on reliability in modern, data-intensive systems, including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> AI</a> infrastructure and global<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers\" target=\"_self\"> data centers</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe problem now isn\u2019t getting data,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing which data to trust.\u201d</p><h2>Charting his IEEE journey</h2><p>Pham joined IEEE in 1985 as a student member and credits the organization with shaping much of his professional life. IEEE provided a platform for scholarship, collaboration, and visibility at critical moments in his career, he says.</p><p>He served as associate technical editor of<a href=\"https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-magazine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Communications Magazine</em></em></a> from 1992 to 2000, was a guest editor for a special issue on fault-tolerant software in the June 1993<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17387&amp;tip=sid#google_vignette\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Reliability</em></em></a>, and was the program vice chair of the annual IEEE<a href=\"https://rams.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Reliability and Maintainability Symposium</a> in 1994. In 2024 he returned to Vietnam as a plenary speaker at the 16th <a href=\"https://sice-si.org/SII2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration</a>.</p><p>In addition to being named a distinguished professor at Rutgers, he served as chair of the<a href=\"https://www.ise.rutgers.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> industrial and systems engineering department</a> from 2007 to 2013.</p><p>\u201cIf my journey holds one lesson,\u201d he says, \u201cit is this: Struggle builds resilience, and resilience makes the extraordinary possible. Even in darkness, perseverance lights the way.\u201d</p>"

That\u2019s a 36 percent jump from the company\u2019s previous outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and\u2014perhaps most significantly\u2014a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that could turn the data center boom into a bust.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_1\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p>The power grid engineering workforce is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">currently shrinking</a>, and data center operators are also hurting for trained <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-jobs\" target=\"_self\">electrical engineers</a>. Laura Laltrello, the chief operating officer for <a href=\"https://www.applieddigital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Applied Digital</a>, says demand has accelerated for civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers, as well as construction management and oversight positions in recent months. (Applied Digital is a data center developer and operator that is building two data center campuses near Harwood, North Dakota, that will require 1.4 GW of power when completed.) The growing demand for skilled workers has forced her company to widen the recruitment perimeter.</p><p>\u201cAs we anticipate a shortage of traditional engineering talent, we are sourcing from diverse industries,\u201d says Laltrello. \u201cWe are finding experts who understand power and cooling from sectors like nuclear energy, the military, and aerospace. Expertise doesn\u2019t have to come from a data center background.\u201d</p><h2>Growing Demand for Data Center Engineers</h2><p>For every engineer needed to design, specify, build, inspect, commission, or run a new AI data center, dozens of other positions are in short supply. According to the Association for Computer Operations and Management\u2019s (AFCOM) <a href=\"https://afcom.com/news/news.asp?id=692525\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Data Center Report 2025</a>, 58 percent of data center managers<span> </span>identified multiskilled data center operators as the top area of growth, while 50 percent signaled increasing demand for data center engineers. Security specialists are also a critical need.</p><p>Through the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for almost <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-14/whats-behind-the-projected-construction-employment-growth-from-2023-to-2033.htm\" target=\"_blank\">400,000 more construction workers by 2033</a>. By far the biggest needs are in power infrastructure, electricians, plumbing, and HVAC, <a target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and roughly </a><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">17,500 electrical and electronics engineers</a>.<span> </span>These categories directly map to the skills required to design, build, commission, and operate modern data centers.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is not simply the absolute number of workers available, but the timing and intensity of demand,\u201d says Bill Kleyman, author of the AFCOM report and the CEO of AI infrastructure firm <a href=\"https://www.apolo.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Apolo</a>. \u201cData centers are expanding at the same time that utilities, manufacturing, renewables, grid infrastructure, and construction are all competing for the same skilled labor pool, and AI is amplifying this pressure.\u201d</p><p>Data center developers like <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a> and construction firms like <a href=\"https://www.crusoe.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Crusoe</a> face enormous demands to build faster, bigger, and more power-dense facilities. For example, they\u2019re developing the Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, for Oracle and OpenAI. The project has two buildings that went live in October 2025, with another six scheduled for completion by the middle of 2026. The entire AI data center campus, once completed, will require 1.2 GW of power.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_6\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-mcnamara-1055211/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael McNamara</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a>, says that in one year his company can currently build enough AI data center infrastructure to require 1 GW of power. Big tech firms, he says, want this raised to 1 GW a quarter and eventually 1 GW per month or less.</p><p>That kind of ramp-up of construction pace calls for tens of thousands more engineers. The shortage of engineering talent is paralleled by persistent staffing shortages in data center operations and facility management professionals, electrical and mechanical technicians, high-voltage and power systems engineers, skilled HVAC technicians with experience in high-density or liquid cooling, and construction specialists familiar with complex mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) integration, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhawkins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Hawkins</a>, the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>director of education for Uptime Institute.</p><p>\u201cDemand for each category is rising significantly faster than supply,\u201d says Hawkins.</p><p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>Technical colleges and applied education programs are among the most effective engines for workforce growth in the data center industry. They focus on hands-on skills, facilities operations, power and cooling systems, and real-world job readiness. With so many new data centers being built in Texas, workforce programs are popping up all over that state. One example is the SMU Lyle School of Engineering\u2019s Master of Science in Datacenter Systems Engineering (MS DSE) in Dallas. The program blends electrical engineering, IT, facilities management, business continuity, and cybersecurity. There is also a 12-week AI data center technician program at Dallas College and a similar program at Texas State Technical College near Waco.</p><p>\u201cTechnical colleges are driving the charge in bringing new talent to an industry undergoing exponential growth with an almost infinite appetite for skilled workers,\u201d says Wendy Schuchart, an association manager at AFCOM.</p><p>Vendors and industry associations are actively addressing the talent gap too.

Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills\u2014capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace.</p><p>AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybercrime\" target=\"_self\">cybercrime</a>, predict equipment failures in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stealthy-startup-aims-to-reinvent-ai-for-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">manufacturing</a>, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-jobs\" target=\"_self\">mass layoffs</a> across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals.</p><p>Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/discover-manager-credit-card-fraud\" target=\"_self\">banking</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotic-process-automation-gokul-pandy\" target=\"_self\">health care</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai\" target=\"_self\">retail</a>, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making\u2014and keep up with the competition.</p><p>The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/san-murugesan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Murugesan</a> and<a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rneamtu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Rodica Neamtu</a>.</p><p>Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at <a href=\"https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Western Sydney University</a>, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at <a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, in Massachusetts.</p><p>The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains.</p><p>The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework.</p><h2>Why AI careers are being redefined</h2><p>AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy.</p><p>Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write.</p><p>The guide cites surveys of executives about AI\u2019s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey & Co.</a> The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants\u2019 insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate.</p><p>The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve.</p><h2>Developing complementary skills</h2><p>The strategic approach aligns with advice from <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/neil-thompson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Thompson</a>, director of FutureTech research at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.</p><p>\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,\u201d he says. \u201cApplying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.\u201d</p><h2>The technical foundation still matters</h2><p>Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning\" target=\"_self\"> machine learning</a>, and computing infrastructure.</p><p>Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say.</p><p>Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say.</p><p>Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Web Services</a>,<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Cloud</a>, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmfq865whp_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21503043035&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_sCA_X2u0APALLSysANK0Vhk&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure</a> is important, according to the guide\u2019s authors.</p><p>Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2025\" target=\"_self\">Python</a> has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models.</p><h2>From algorithms to frameworks</h2><p>The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PyTorch</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.meta.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meta AI</a>, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scikit-learn</a> provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. <strong>\u2014Neil Thompson, MIT</strong> </p><p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TensorFlow</a>, a software library for machine learning and AI created by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?zx=1767047914659&amp;no_sw_cr=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction.</p><p>The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints.</p><h2>Soft skills as career insurance</h2><p>Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders.</p><p>Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning.</p><p>Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt.</p><h2>Experience before titles</h2><p>The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience.</p><p>Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career.</p><h2>Entry-level roles that open doors</h2><p>Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide.</p><p>Each starting point reinforces the guide\u2019s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance.</p><h2>Curiosity as a long-term strategy</h2><p>Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process.</p><p>\u201cAlways be curious,\u201d he says. \u201cLearn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.\u201d</p><p>Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one\u2019s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend.</p><p>In a field where today\u2019s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide\u2019s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.</p>"

In talking to Xcel line workers and fellow safety engineers, he sensed that the accident cluster might be the tip of an iceberg. And when he and two industry colleagues scoured data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, they found 81 induction accidents between 1985 and 2021 and 60 deaths, which they documented in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9925039\" target=\"_blank\">a 2022 report</a>.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it is really common.

Both are interwoven with conductive materials such as stainless steel threads, which form a Faraday cage that shields the wearer against the lines\u2019 electric fields. But the standard suits have limited capacity to shunt current because usually they don\u2019t need to. Like a bird on a wire, bare-hands workers are electrically floating, rather than grounded, so current largely bypasses them via the line itself.</p><h2>Induction Safety Suit Design</h2><p>Backed by a US $250,000 investment from Xcel in 2019, Electrostatics adapted its standard suits by adding low-resistance conductive straps that pass current around a worker\u2019s body. \u201cWhen I\u2019m touching a conductor with one hand and the other hand is grounded, the current will flow through the straps to get out,\u201d says <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/n%25C3%25A9meth-b%25C3%25A1lint-1a366586?originalSubdomain=hu\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00e1lint N\u00e9meth</a>, Electrostatics\u2019 CEO and director of the <a href=\"https://nfl.vet.bme.hu/en/\" target=\"_blank\">High Voltage Laboratory</a> at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man holds one side of his jacket open revealing conductive straps inside.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c7b7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-holds-one-side-of-his-jacket-open-revealing-conductive-straps-inside.jpg?id=62695052&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A strapping system links all the elements of the suit\u2014the jacket, trousers, gloves, and socks\u2014and guides current through a controlled path outside the body. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">BME HVL </small></p><p>The company began selling the suits in 2023, and they have since been adopted by over a dozen transmission operators in the United States and Europe, as well as other countries including Canada, Indonesia, and Turkey. They cost about $5,200 in the United States.</p><p>Electrostatics\u2019 suits had to meet a crucial design threshold: keeping body exposure below the 6-milliampere \u201clet-go\u201d threshold, beyond which electrocuted workers become unable to remove themselves from a circuit. \u201cIf you lose control of your muscles, you\u2019re going to hold onto the conductor until you pass out or possibly die,\u201d says Ramirez Bettoni.</p><p>The gear, which includes the suit, gloves, and socks, protects against 100 amperes for 10 seconds and 50 A for 30 seconds. It also has insulation to protect against heat created by high current and flame retardants to protect against electric arcs.</p><p>Kropp, N\u00e9meth, and Ramirez Bettoni are hoping that developing industry standards for induction safety gear, including <a href=\"https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/standard-performance-specification-for-conductive-clothing-for-industry-applications\" target=\"_blank\">ones published in October</a>, will broaden their use.

And although it took decades to take hold in the modern office, it found novel uses in other fields.</p><h2>Who invented the Dictaphone?</h2><p>The Dictaphone was born from the competition and the cooperation of Bell and Edison and their capable teams of researchers. In 1877, Edison had introduced <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/edisons-phonograph\" target=\"_blank\">the phonograph</a>, which he later declared <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2022/03/thomas-edisons-favorite-invention-the-phonograph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his favorite invention</a>. And yet he wasn\u2019t quite certain about its commercial applications. Initially, he thought it might be good for recording telephone messages. Then he began to imagine other uses: a mechanical stenographer for businessmen, a notetaker for students, an elocution instructor, a talking book for the blind.

And after a few public demonstrations, he set aside the invention to pursue other interests.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an apparatus consisting of a metal cylinder on a metal rod with a handle, seated on a flat rectangular base. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b77c1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-an-apparatus-consisting-of-a-metal-cylinder-on-a-metal-rod-with-a-handle-seated-on-a-flat-rectangular.jpg?id=62563774&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Thomas Edison\u2019s early phonograph from 1877 used a needle to record sound waves on a rotating cylinder wrapped with tinfoil. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Thomas Edison National Historical Park/National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior</small></p><p>Enter Bell. In 1880, the French government had awarded Bell the Volta Prize and 50,000 francs (about US $10,000 at the time) for his invention of the telephone. The following year, he, his cousin Chichester A. Bell, and Charles Sumner Tainter used the prize money to found the Volta Laboratory Association in Washington, D.C., to do research on sound recording and transmission.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/particle-physics-resurrects-alexander-graham-bells-voice\" target=\"_self\">Particle Physics Resurrects Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s Voice</a></p><p>Tainter saw potential in the phonograph. Edison\u2019s version used a needle to etch sound waves on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a metal cylinder. The foil was easily damaged, the sound quality was distorted and squeaky, and the cylinder could be replayed only a few times before degrading and becoming inaudible. Edison\u2019s phonograph couldn\u2019t be easily commercialized, in other words.</p><p>Chichester Bell and Tainter greatly improved the sound quality by replacing the tinfoil with <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\" target=\"_blank\">wax-coated cardboard cylinders</a>.

As a \u201cdictator,\u201d you would speak into the tube, and a stylus would trace the sound wave on the wax cylinder. The cylinder would then be handed off to a secretary for transcription. Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary.</p><p>A manufacturing company set up by Volta Lab sold several machines to the U.S. government. One enthusiastic early adopter was Edward D. Easton, a noted stenographer for the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Easton took notes in shorthand, he immediately recited his notes into the Graphophone after each session.</p><p>Easton became an evangelist for the instrument, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Phonogram1_4/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">writing glowing accounts</a> in a trade magazine. The machine made no mistakes and could take dictation as fast as the speaker could articulate. The phonograph never complained when a transcriber needed a phrase repeated. The phonograph didn\u2019t suffer from poor penmanship. Anyone could learn to use the machine in two weeks or less, compared to months or years to master stenography. Such were Easton\u2019s claims. (Easton was such a fan that he cofounded the Columbia Phonograph Co., which went on to become a leading maker of phonographs and recorded music and lives on today as <a href=\"https://www.columbiarecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia Records</a>.)</p><p>Before long, several companies were manufacturing and selling phonographs and dictation machines. Even though demand was initially light, patent-infringement lawsuits sprang up, which soon threatened to bankrupt all of the companies involved. Finally, in 1896, the various parties agreed to stop fighting and to cross-license each other\u2019s intellectual property. This didn\u2019t end the Bell-Edison rivalry, but it allowed the phonograph business to take off in earnest, aided by the sales of mass-produced recorded music cylinders. And the accepted name for this entertainment machine became the phonograph.</p><h2>The Dictaphone Gets Down to Business</h2><p>But Bell, Tainter, and Edison didn\u2019t forget the original promise of mechanical stenography, and the rivals soon came out with competing and very similar products designed specifically for dictation: the Dictaphone and the Ediphone. The public found it difficult to distinguish the two products, and it wasn\u2019t long before \u201cdictaphone\u201d was being used to describe all dictation machines. (The Columbia Graphophone Co. trademarked \u201cDictaphone\u201d in 1907\u2014a confusing neologism of <em><em>dicta</em></em> from the Latin for \u201csayings\u201d or \u201csay repeatedly\u201d and <em><em>phone</em></em> from the Greek for \u201cvoice\u201d or \u201csound.\u201d)</p><p>As David Morton recounts in his 1999 book <em><em>Off the Record</em></em> (Rutgers University Press), Dictaphone sales accelerated as scientific management for business began to take root. Office managers intent on streamlining, standardizing, and systemizing workflows saw the Dictaphone as a labor-saving device. In 1912, for instance, an efficiency commission set up by U.S. President William Taft endorsed the use of dictation machines in government offices. The railroad and insurance industries followed suit as they standardized their financial records. Later, managers began using dictation machines to conquer their business correspondence.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an older man with a moustache holding a tube near his mouth.

The U.S. government was an early adopter of the machines.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Library of Congress</small></p><p>And yet, the Dictaphone wasn\u2019t obviously destined to become an indispensable piece of office equipment like the typewriter. In 1923, for instance, 15,000 dictation machines were sold in the United States, versus 744,000 typewriters.</p><p>In 1926, the Dictaphone Corp. tried to drum up interest by sponsoring Henry Lunn, founder of a large U.K. travel company, on an around-the-world lecture tour. At each hotel he visited, the company ensured there was a Dictaphone for Lunn to record his diary. Consider this a prototype for the modern hotel business center. At the end of his journey, Lunn published <em><em>Round the World With a Dictaphone</em></em>\u2014part travelogue, part proselytizing for Christian churches to support the League of Nations, and part Dictaphone promotion. Even so, by 1945, Dictaphone estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of the potential market had been captured.</p><p>There were social reasons working against dictation machines, Morton says in his book. Executives relied on their secretaries not only for dictation and transcription, but also for their often unacknowledged aid in prompting, correcting, and filling in their bosses\u2019 thoughts\u2014the soft skills that a machine could not replace.</p><p>Morton also attributes the slow uptake to the technology itself. One quirk of the Dictaphone is that it continued to use wax cylinders long after phonograph players had switched to discs. Transcribers often complained that the wax recordings were unintelligible\u2014dictators needed to speak directly into the speaking tube, loudly, clearly, and at an appropriate pace, but many did not.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman sitting at a manual typewriter and wearing headphones that connect to a machine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"df276\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-sitting-at-a-manual-typewriter-and-wearing-headphones-that-connect-to-a-machine.jpg?id=62564524&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A secretary plays back the sound from a recorded Ediphone cylinder in 1930 to transcribe the cylinder\u2019s contents.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Popperfoto/Getty Images</small></p><p>During World War II, Dictaphone finally ditched the wax cylinders in favor of etching grooves on a plastic belt, although the new machines were available only to U.S. government agencies until the end of the war. In 1947, the company publicly introduced the new technology with its Time-Master series. Each Dictabelt held about 15 minutes of recording. Meanwhile, Edison\u2019s Ediphone was rebranded the <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2016/09/15/take-a-memo/\" target=\"_blank\">Voicewriter</a> and recorded on distinctive red plastic discs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a rectangular device with a long cord and microphone and 3 reddish discs with a hole in the middle. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f63d1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-rectangular-device-with-a-long-cord-and-microphone-and-3-reddish-discs-with-a-hole-in-the-middle.jpg?id=62564655&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This 1953 Edison Voicewriter recorded the speaker\u2019s voice on plastic Diamond Discs. Magnetic tape came later.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian Design Museum/Smithsonian Institution</small></p><p>In the 1960s, Dictaphone finally embraced magnetic recording tape, in the form of cassette tapes. Pressure initially came from European companies, such as the Dutch electronics company Philips, which entered the U.S. market in 1958 with a low-priced tape-cartridge machine. Four years later, Philips introduced the Compact Cassette, which became the basis of today\u2019s audio cassette. Transistorized electronics furthered miniaturization and made dictation machines much more portable. Eventually, solid-state storage replaced magnetic tape, and today, we all carry around a dictation device with an effectively infinite recording time via cloud storage, and, if we choose to use it, automatic transcription.</p><h2>The Dictaphone in the Classroom</h2><p>None of the stories about businessmen using (or abusing) Dictaphones really surprised me. What did surprise me were the creative ways the Dictaphone was used as a pedagogical tool.</p><p>In 1924, for example, Dwight Everett Watkins at the University of California described in a paper how his students used a microphone, an amplifier, a telemegaphone (a type of speaker), and a Dictaphone to aid in public speaking. The setup helped students understand their rhetorical imperfections: bad grammar and bad sentence and paragraph structure. It also helped with elocution\u2014one of the early applications that Edison envisioned for his phonograph.</p><p>In 1933, George F. Meyer wrote about using the Dictaphone as an educational aid for blind and low-vision students in Minneapolis. Teachers recorded course material that would otherwise have had to be read aloud. And the students liked being able to listen to the material repeatedly without inconveniencing a human reader.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman seated to the left and typing on a typewriter, with a crowd of young women standing around her wearing headphones that connect to a machine at the typist\\u2019s side.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"568fe\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-seated-to-the-left-and-typing-on-a-typewriter-with-a-crowd-of-young-women-standing-around-her.jpg?id=62564721&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Students in 1930 listen to a Dictaphone recording, which the seated woman controls with foot pedals.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images</small></p><p>In 1938, Frances M. Freeman wrote her master\u2019s thesis on whether the Dictaphone could help typing students who were struggling to master the skill. Her study was supported by the Dictaphone Sales Corp., but unfortunately for the company, she concluded that using a Dictaphone offered no advantage in learning to type. She did find that the students in the Dictaphone group seemed more alert in class than students taught the traditional way.</p><p>That last finding was borne out in a 1964 experiment at Dunbar Elementary School in New Orleans, where the Dictaphone Corp. had outfitted an \u201celectronic classroom.\u201d The idea was to help reluctant students by fostering an environment where learning was fun. As Principal Beulah E. Brown related in an article about the experiment, she\u2019d first encountered a Dictaphone several years earlier while on sabbatical and immediately saw its pedagogical potential. The Dictaphone, Brown wrote, promised individually tailored educational experiences, allowing students to focus on specific challenges and freeing the teacher to have more personal interactions with each child. Testimonials from Warren Honore\u2019s fifth grade class attest to its success as an engaging technology.</p><h2>From the Dictaphone to Email to AI</h2><p>As a historian of technology, I loved learning that two heavyweights in the field, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/us/melvin-kranzberg-78-historian-of-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">Melvin Kranzberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Kuhn</a>, were both committed fans of the Dictaphone. I also enjoyed meditating on the role of the dictaphone and other technology as a mediator in the writing process.</p><p>My research turned up <a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/tolstoys-dictaphone\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Tolstoy\u2019s Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse</em></em></a> (Graywolf Press), a 1996 collection of essays edited by the literary critic <a href=\"https://agnionline.bu.edu/about/our-people/authors/sven-birkerts/\" target=\"_blank\">Sven Birkerts</a><em><em>. </em></em>The title comes from an anecdote about the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who refused the offer of a Dictaphone because it would be \u201ctoo dreadfully exciting\u201d and would distract him from his literary pursuits. To form the volume, Birkerts posed questions to his authors concerning the place of self and soul in a society being bombarded with new forms of communication\u2014namely, email and the internet.</p><p>Today, of course, our world is being shaped by AI, arguably an even bigger disrupter than email was in the 1990s or the Dictaphone was in the early 20th century. But then, technology is always trying to remake society, and the path it takes is never inevitable. Sometimes, when we\u2019re lucky, it is delightfully surprising.</p><p><em>Part of a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\">continuing series</a> looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></p><p><span><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2026 print issue as \u201cThis Machine Listened to \u2018Dictators.\u2019 \u201d</em></span></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>David Morton emailed me and suggested I write about the Dictaphone after hearing me <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1127295581\" target=\"_blank\">give a talk</a> about this series.

The skies are usually clear, the air is arid, and the electronic din of civilization is far away.</p><p>It was to one of these places, in the high desert of New Mexico, that a young astronomer named <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/burns/\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Burns</a> went to study radio jets and quasars far beyond the Milky Way. It was 1979, he was just out of grad school, and the <a href=\"https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/\" target=\"_blank\">Very Large Array</a>, a constellation of 28 giant dish antennas on an open plain, was a new mecca of radio astronomy.</p><p>But the VLA had its limitations\u2014namely, that Earth\u2019s protective atmosphere and ionosphere blocked many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and that, even in a remote desert, earthly interference was never completely gone.</p><p>Could there be a better, even lonelier place to put a radio telescope? Sure, a NASA planetary scientist named <a href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/NASA_HQ/SMD/MendellWW/MendellWW_9-20-17.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Wendell Mendell</a>, told Burns: How about the moon? He asked if Burns had ever thought about building one there.</p><p>\u201cMy immediate reaction was no. Maybe even hell, no. Why would I want to do that?\u201d Burns recalls with a self-deprecating smile. His work at the VLA had gone well, he was fascinated by cosmology\u2019s big questions, and he didn\u2019t want to be slowed by the bureaucratic slog of getting funding to launch a new piece of hardware.</p><p>But Mendell suggested he do some research and speak at a conference on future lunar observatories, and Burns\u2019s thinking about a space-based radio telescope began to shift. That was in 1984. In the four decades since, he\u2019s published more than <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_database_fq_database=OR&amp;filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&amp;format=SHORT&amp;fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&amp;fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&amp;q=%3Dauthor%3A(%22burns%2C%20jack%22%20OR%20%22burns%2C%20jack%20o.%22%20OR%20%22burns%2C%20j.o.%22)&amp;sort=score%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;unprocessed_parameter=qform&amp;unprocessed_parameter=Require%20Field%20for%20Selection&amp;p_=0\" target=\"_blank\">500 peer-reviewed papers</a> on radio astronomy.

And while doing all that, Burns has had an ongoing second job of sorts, as a quietly persistent advocate for radio astronomy from space.</p><p>And early next year, if all goes well, a radio telescope for which he\u2019s a scientific investigator will be launched\u2014not just into space, not just to the moon, but to the moon\u2019s far side, where it will observe things invisible from Earth.</p><p>\u201cYou can see we don\u2019t lack for ambition after all these years,\u201d says Burns, now 73 and a professor emeritus of astrophysics at <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/burns/about-jack\" target=\"_blank\">the University of Colorado Boulder</a>.</p><p>The instrument is called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10345\" target=\"_blank\">LuSEE-Night</a>, short for <a href=\"https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=122408\" target=\"_blank\">Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment\u2013Night</a><a href=\"https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/lunar-science/lunar-landers/Firefly_Blue%20Ghost%20Mission%202_2025.jpg?w=2689&amp;h=1513&amp;fit=clip&amp;crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint\" target=\"_blank\">.</a> It will be launched from Florida aboard a SpaceX rocket and carried to the moon\u2019s far side atop a squat four-legged robotic spacecraft called <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ghost Mission 2</a>, built and operated by <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefly Aerospace</a> of Cedar Park, Texas.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Illustration of a four-legged structure with solar panels on the sides on the surface of the moon. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f6e66\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-four-legged-structure-with-solar-panels-on-the-sides-on-the-surface-of-the-moon.png?id=62815356&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In an artist\u2019s rendering, the LuSEE-Night radio telescope sits atop Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost 2 lander, which will carry it to the moon\u2019s far side. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Firefly Aerospace </small></p><p>Landing will be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-landing\" target=\"_self\">risky</a>: Blue Ghost 2 will be on its own, in a place that\u2019s out of the sight of ground controllers.

Odysseus was damaged on landing, but Burns\u2019s experiment still returned some useful data.</p><p>Burns says he\u2019d be bummed about that 2024 mission if there weren\u2019t so many more coming up. He\u2019s joined in proposing myriad designs for radio telescopes that could go to the moon. And he\u2019s kept going through political disputes, technical delays, even a confrontation with cancer. Finally, finally, the effort is paying off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting our feet into the lunar soil,\u201d says Burns, \u201cand understanding what is possible with these radio telescopes in a place where we\u2019ve never observed before.\u201d</p><h2>Why Go to the Far Side of the Moon? </h2><p>A moon-based radio telescope could help unravel some of the greatest mysteries in space science. Dark matter, dark energy, neutron stars, and gravitational waves could all come into better focus if observed from the moon. One of Burns\u2019s collaborators on LuSEE-Night, astronomer <a href=\"https://pma.caltech.edu/people/gregg-w-hallinan\" target=\"_blank\">Gregg Hallinan</a> of Caltech, would like such a telescope to further his research on <a href=\"https://www.kiss.caltech.edu/impact/Hallinan.html\" target=\"_blank\">electromagnetic activity around exoplanets</a>, a possible measure of whether these distant worlds are habitable. Burns himself is especially interested in the <a href=\"https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/physics-of-cosmic-dark-ages-100436.html\" target=\"_blank\">cosmic dark ages</a>, an epoch that began more than 13 billion years ago, just 380,000 years after the big bang. The young universe had cooled enough for neutral hydrogen atoms to form, which trapped the light of stars and galaxies. The dark ages lasted between 200 million and 400 million years.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-timeline\"><noscript><img alt=\"timeline visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27231096/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p class=\"caption\">LuSEE-Night will listen for faint signals from the cosmic dark ages, a period that began about 380,000 years after the big bang, when neutral hydrogen atoms had begun to form, trapping the light of stars and galaxies. <span class=\"media-photo-credit\">Chris Philpot</span></p><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a critical period in the history of the universe,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut we have no data from it.\u201d</span></p><p>The problem is that residual radio signals from this epoch are very faint and easily drowned out by closer noise\u2014in particular, our earthly communications networks, power grids, radar, and so forth. The sun adds its share, too. What\u2019s more, these early signals have been dramatically redshifted by the expansion of the universe, their wavelengths stretched as their sources have sped away from us over billions of years. The most critical example is neutral hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, which when excited in the laboratory emits a radio signal with a wavelength of 21 centimeters. Indeed, with just <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/software-defined-radio\" target=\"_self\">some backyard equipment</a>, you can easily detect neutral hydrogen in nearby galactic gas clouds close to that wavelength, which corresponds to a frequency of 1.42 gigahertz. But if the hydrogen signal originates from the dark ages, those 21 centimeters are lengthened to tens of meters. That means scientists need to listen to frequencies well below 50 megahertz\u2014parts of the radio spectrum that are largely blocked by Earth\u2019s ionosphere.</p><p>Which is why the lunar far side holds such appeal. It may just be the quietest site in the inner solar system.</p><p>\u201cIt really is the only place in the solar system that never faces the Earth,\u201d says <a href=\"https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/david-deboer/\" target=\"_blank\">David DeBoer</a>, a research astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt really is kind of a wonderful, unique place.\u201d</p><p>For radio astronomy, things get even better during the lunar night, when the sun drops beneath the horizon and is blocked by the moon\u2019s mass. For up to 14 Earth-days at a time, a spot on the moon\u2019s far side is about as electromagnetically dark as any place in the inner solar system can be. No radiation from the sun, no confounding signals from Earth. There may be signals from a few distant space probes, but otherwise, ideally, your antenna only hears the raw noise of the cosmos<strong>.</strong></p><p>\u201cWhen you get down to those very low radio frequencies, there\u2019s a source of noise that appears that\u2019s associated with the solar wind,\u201d says Caltech\u2019s Hallinan. Solar wind is the stream of charged particles that speed relentlessly from the sun. \u201cAnd the only location where you can escape that within a billion kilometers of the Earth is on the lunar surface, on the nighttime side. The solar wind screams past it, and you get a cavity where you can hide away from that noise.\u201d</p><h2>How Does LuSEE-Night Work? </h2><p>LuSEE-Night\u2019s receiver looks simple, though there\u2019s really nothing simple about it.

I think that\u2019s what LuSEE-Night will give us.\u201d</p><p>The apparatus was designed to serve several incompatible needs: It had to be sensitive enough to detect very weak signals from deep space; rugged enough to withstand the extremes of the lunar environment; and quiet enough to not interfere with its own observations, yet loud enough to talk to Earth via relay satellite as needed. Plus the instrument had to stick to a budget of about US $40 million and not weigh more than 120 kilograms. The mission plan calls for two years of operations.</p><p>The antennas are made of a beryllium copper alloy, chosen for its high conductivity and stability as lunar temperatures plummet or soar by as much as 250 \u00b0C every time the sun rises or sets. LuSEE-Night will make precise voltage measurements of the signals it receives, using a high-impedance junction field-effect transistor to act as an amplifier for each antenna. The signals are then fed into a spectrometer\u2014the main science instrument\u2014which reads those voltages at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10345\" target=\"_blank\">102.4 million samples per second</a>. That high read-rate is meant to prevent the exaggeration of any errors as faint signals are amplified. Scientists believe that a cosmic dark-ages signature would be five to six orders of magnitude weaker than the other signals that LuSEE-Night will record.</p><p>The turntable is there to help characterize the signals the antennas receive, so that, among other things, an ancient dark-ages signature can be distinguished from closer, newer signals from, say, galaxies or interstellar gas clouds. Data from the early universe should be virtually <a href=\"https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1973ApJ...180..317C%22%3ECollins\" target=\"_blank\">isotropic</a>, meaning that it comes from all over the sky, regardless of the antennas\u2019 orientation. Newer signals are more likely to come from a specific direction. Hence the turntable: If you collect data over the course of a lunar night, then reorient the antennas and listen again, you\u2019ll be better able to distinguish the distant from the very, very distant.</p><p>What\u2019s the ideal lunar <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07173v1#S3\" target=\"_blank\">landing spot</a> if you want to take such readings? One as nearly opposite Earth as possible, on a flat plain. Not an easy thing to find on the moon\u2019s hummocky far side, but mission planners pored over maps made by lunar satellites and chose a prime location about 24 degrees south of the lunar equator.</p><p>Other lunar telescopes have been proposed for placement in the permanently shadowed craters near the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/moon-base\" target=\"_self\">moon\u2019s south pole</a>, just over the horizon when viewed from Earth. Such craters are coveted for the water ice they may hold, and the low temperatures in them (below -240 \u00b0C) are great if you\u2019re doing infrared astronomy and need to keep your instruments cold. But the location is terrible if you\u2019re working in long-wavelength radio.</p><p>\u201cEven the inside of such craters would be hard to shield from Earth-based radio frequency interference (RFI) signals,\u201d <a href=\"https://leonkoopmans.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Leon Koopmans</a> of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, said in an email. \u201cThey refract off the crater rims and often, due to their long wavelength, simply penetrate right through the crater rim.\u201d</p><p>RFI is a major\u2014and sometimes maddening\u2014issue for sensitive instruments. The first-ever landing on the lunar far side was by the Chinese <a href=\"https://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465652/n6465653/c6805233/content.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chang\u2019e 4</a> spacecraft, in 2019. It carried a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022RS007595\" target=\"_blank\">low-frequency radio spectrometer</a>, among other experiments. But it failed to return meaningful results, Chinese researchers said, mostly because of interference from the spacecraft itself.</p><h2>The Accidental Birth of Radio Astronomy </h2><p>Sometimes, though, a little interference makes history. Here, it\u2019s worth a pause to remember <a href=\"https://legacy.nrao.edu/epo/aoc/puente/jansky/hist_jansky.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Jansky</a>, considered the <a href=\"https://aas.org/posts/news/2018/07/month-astronomical-history-1\" target=\"_blank\">father of radio astronomy</a>. In 1928, he was a young engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J., assigned to isolate <a href=\"https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/201505/physicshistory.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">sources of static in shortwave transatlantic telephone calls</a>. Two years later, he built a <a href=\"https://www.bigear.org/CSMO/HTML/CS12/cs12p08.htm\" target=\"_blank\">30-meter-long directional antenna</a>, mostly out of brass and wood, and after accounting for thunderstorms and the like, there was still noise he couldn\u2019t explain. At first, its strength seemed to follow a daily cycle, rising and sinking with the sun. But after a few months\u2019 observation, the sun and the noise were badly out of sync.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a man standing in a field in front of a large structure made of crisscrossing segments and resting on wheels. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8d525\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-standing-in-a-field-in-front-of-a-large-structure-made-of-crisscrossing-segments-and-resting-on-w.png?id=62821778&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 1930, Karl Jansky, a Bell Labs engineer in Holmdel, N.J., built this rotating antenna on wheels to identify sources of static for radio communications.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">NRAO/AUI/NSF </small></p><p>It gradually became clear that the noise\u2019s period wasn\u2019t 24 hours; it was 23 hours and 56 minutes\u2014the time it takes Earth to turn once relative to the stars. The strongest interference seemed to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, which optical astronomy suggested was the center of the Milky Way. In 1933, Jansky published a paper in <a href=\"https://proceedingsoftheieee.ieee.org/about/history/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers</em></em></a> with a provocative title: \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.1998.681378\" target=\"_blank\">Electrical Disturbances Apparently of Extraterrestrial Origin</a>.\u201d He had opened the electromagnetic spectrum up to astronomers, even though he never got to pursue radio astronomy himself. The interference he had defined was, to him, \u201cstar noise.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-two years later, two other Bell Labs scientists, <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1978/penzias/biographical/\" target=\"_blank\">Arno Penzias</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1978/wilson/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Wilson</a>, ran into some interference of their own. In 1965 they were trying to adapt a <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NHLS/89002457_text\" target=\"_blank\">horn antenna</a> in Holmdel for radio astronomy\u2014but there was a hiss, in the <a href=\"https://aether.lbl.gov/www/science/cmb.html\" target=\"_blank\">microwave</a> band, coming from all parts of the sky. They had no idea what it was. They ruled out interference from New York City, not far to the north. They rewired the receiver. They cleaned out bird droppings in the antenna. Nothing worked.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large triangular structure on a frame, with two people looking up at it.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fa4de\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-triangular-structure-on-a-frame-with-two-people-looking-up-at-it.jpg?id=62822141&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In the 1960s, Arno Penzias and Robert W. Wilson used this horn antenna in Holmdel, N.J., to detect faint signals from the big bang. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">GL Archive/Alamy </small></p><p>Meanwhile, an hour\u2019s drive away, a team of physicists at Princeton University under <a href=\"https://phy.princeton.edu/department/history/faculty-history/robert-dicke\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Dicke</a> was trying to find proof of the big bang that began the universe 13.8 billion years ago. They theorized that it would have left a hiss, in the microwave band, coming from all parts of the sky. They\u2019d begun to build an antenna. Then Dicke got a phone call from Penzias and Wilson, looking for help. \u201cWell, boys, we\u2019ve been scooped,\u201d he famously said when the call was over. Penzias and Wilson had accidentally found the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/big-bang-theory-discovery\" target=\"_self\">cosmic microwave background</a>, or CMB, the leftover radiation from the big bang.</p><p>Burns and his colleagues are figurative heirs to Jansky, Penzias, and Wilson. Researchers suggest that the giveaway signature of the cosmic dark ages may be a <a href=\"https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=221439\" target=\"_blank\">minuscule dip</a> in the CMB. They theorize that dark-ages hydrogen may be detectable only because it has been absorbing a little bit of the microwave energy from the dawn of the universe.</p><h2>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress </h2><p>The plan for Blue Ghost Mission 2 is to touch down soon after the sun has risen at the landing site. That will give mission managers two weeks to check out the spacecraft, take pictures, conduct other experiments that Blue Ghost carries, and charge LuSEE-Night\u2019s battery pack with its photovoltaic panels. Then, as local sunset comes, they\u2019ll turn everything off except for the LuSEE-Night receiver and a bare minimum of support systems.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Image of the moon's surface, with a closeup of one section. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5b48b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image-of-the-moon-s-surface-with-a-closeup-of-one-section.png?id=62815382&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">LuSEE-Night will land at a site [orange dot] that\u2019s about 25 degrees south of the moon\u2019s equator and opposite the center of the moon\u2019s face as seen from Earth. The moon\u2019s far side is ideal for radio astronomy because it\u2019s shielded from the solar wind as well as signals from Earth. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Arizona State University/GSFC/NASA </small></p><p>There, in the frozen electromagnetic stillness, it will scan the spectrum between 0.1 and 50 MHz, gathering data for a low-frequency <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2508.16773v1\" target=\"_blank\">map</a> of the sky\u2014maybe including the first tantalizing signature of the dark ages.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really tough with that instrument,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut we have some hardware and software techniques that\u2026we\u2019re hoping will allow us to detect what\u2019s called the global or all-sky signal.\u2026 We, in principle, have the sensitivity.\u201d They\u2019ll listen and listen again over the course of the mission. That is, if their equipment doesn\u2019t freeze or fry first.</p><p>A major task for LuSEE-Night is to protect the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07173v1\" target=\"_blank\">electronics</a> that run it. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/moon/weather-on-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\">Temperature extremes</a> are the biggest problem. Systems can be hardened against cosmic radiation, and a sturdy spacecraft should be able to handle the stresses of launch, flight, and landing. But how do you build it to last when temperatures range between 120 and \u2212130 \u00b0C? With layers of insulation? Electric heaters to reduce nighttime chill?</p><p>\u201cAll of the above,\u201d says Burns. To reject daytime heat, there will be a multicell parabolic radiator panel on the outside of the equipment bay. To keep warm at night, there will be battery power\u2014a lot of battery power. Of LuSEE-Night\u2019s launch mass of 108 kg, about 38 kg is a lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of 7,160 watt-hours, mostly to generate heat. The battery cells will recharge photovoltaically after the sun rises. The all-important spectrometer has been programmed to cycle off periodically during the two weeks of darkness, so that the battery\u2019s state of charge doesn\u2019t drop below 8 percent; better to lose some observing time than lose the entire apparatus and not be able to revive it.</p><h2>Lunar Radio Astronomy for the Long Haul </h2><p>And if they can\u2019t revive it? Burns has been through that before. In 2024 he watched helplessly as Odysseus, the first U.S.-made lunar lander in 50 years, touched down\u2014and then went silent for 15 agonizing minutes until controllers in Texas realized they were receiving only occasional pings instead of detailed data. Odysseus <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-landing-intuitive-machines\" target=\"_self\">had landed</a> hard, snapped a leg, and ended up lying almost on its side.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a metal structure inside an open rocket.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"97286\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-metal-structure-inside-an-open-rocket.png?id=62822546&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">ROLSES-1, shown here inside a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, was the first radio telescope to land on the moon, in February 2024. During a hard landing, one leg broke, making it difficult for the telescope to send readings back to Earth.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Intuitive Machines/SpaceX</small></p><p>As part of its scientific cargo, Odysseus carried <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2503.09842v2#S3\" target=\"_blank\">ROLSES-1</a> (Radiowave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photo-Electron Sheath), an experiment Burns and a friend had suggested to NASA years before. It was partly a test of technology, partly to study the complex interactions between sunlight, radiation, and lunar soil\u2014there\u2019s enough electric charge in the soil sometimes that dust particles levitate above the moon\u2019s surface, which could potentially mess with radio observations. But Odysseus was damaged badly enough that instead of a week\u2019s worth of data, ROLSES got 2 hours, most of it recorded before the landing. A grad student working with Burns, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Joshua-J-Hibbard-2182593048\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua Hibbard</a>, managed to partially salvage the experiment and prove that ROLSES had worked: Hidden in its raw data were <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae18d8\" target=\"_blank\">signals from Earth and the Milky Way</a>.</p><p>\u201cIt was a harrowing experience,\u201d Burns said afterward, \u201cand I\u2019ve told my students and friends that I don\u2019t want to be first on a lander again. I want to be second, so that we have a greater chance to be successful.\u201d He says he feels good about LuSEE-Night being on the Blue Ghost 2 mission, especially after the successful Blue Ghost 1 landing. The ROLSES experiment, meanwhile, will get a second chance: ROLSES-2 has been scheduled to fly on <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ghost Mission 3</a>, perhaps in 2028.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Artist\\u2019s rendering of a gray surface with parallel zigzagging lines.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"bbc57\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/artist-u2019s-rendering-of-a-gray-surface-with-parallel-zigzagging-lines.png?id=62821827&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">NASA\u2019s plan for the FarView Observatory lunar radio telescope array, shown in an artist\u2019s rendering, calls for 100,000 dipole antennas to be spread out over 200 square kilometers.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ronald Polidan </small></p><p>If LuSEE-Night succeeds, it will doubtless raise questions that require much <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03418\" target=\"_blank\">more ambitious radio telescopes</a>. Burns, Hallinan, and others have already gotten early NASA funding for a giant interferometric array on the moon called <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117724003405?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">FarView</a>. It would consist of a grid of 100,000 antenna nodes spread over 200 square kilometers, made of aluminum <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-origin-molten-regolith-electrolysis\" target=\"_self\">extracted from lunar soil</a>. They say assembly could begin as soon as the 2030s, although political and budget realities may get in the way.</p><p>Through it all, Burns has gently pushed and prodded and lobbied, advocating for a lunar observatory through the terms of ten NASA administrators and seven U.S. presidents. He\u2019s probably learned more about Washington politics than he ever wanted. American presidents have a habit of reversing the space priorities of their predecessors, so missions have sometimes proceeded full force, then languished for years. With LuSEE-Night finally headed for launch, Burns at times sounds buoyant: \u201cJust think. We\u2019re actually going to do cosmology from the moon.\u201d At other times, he\u2019s been blunt: \u201cI never thought\u2014none of us thought\u2014that it would take 40 years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike anything in science, there\u2019s no guarantee,\u201d says Burns. \u201cBut we need to look.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Built in the 1950s and \u201960s, these structures witnessed the birth of the space age, serving as proving grounds where engineers pushed the limits of rocket technology and ensured every component could withstand the violence of launch.</p><div class=\"badge_module shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\">\n<a class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"Universe Today logo; text reads &quot;This post originally appeared on Universe Today.&quot;\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/universe-today-logo-text-reads-this-post-originally-appeared-on-universe-today.png?id=60568425&amp;width=1800&amp;quality=85\" /></a>\n</div>\n<h2>T-tower\u2019s Role in Rocket Testing</h2><p>The T-tower came first, constructed in 1957 by the <a href=\"https://history.redstone.army.mil/space-abma.html\" target=\"_blank\">Army Ballistic Missile Agency</a> before NASA even existed. At just over 50 meters tall, it was designed for static testing, where rockets are fired at full power while restrained and connected to instruments that measure every vibration, temperature spike, and pressure fluctuation. Here, engineers tested components of the Saturn family of launch vehicles under the direction of Wernher von Braun, including the mighty F-1 engines that would eventually power <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo missions</a>. The tower later proved essential for testing space shuttle solid rocket boosters before being retired in the 1990s.</p><p>The Dynamic Test Stand told an even more dramatic story. Built in 1964 and rising over 105 meters above the Alabama landscape, it once stood as the tallest human-made structure in North Alabama. Unlike the T-tower\u2019s static tests, this facility subjected fully assembled Saturn V rockets to the mechanical stresses and vibrations they would experience during actual flight, everything shaking, flexing, and straining just as it would during launch, but without leaving the ground. Engineers couldn\u2019t afford failures once these rockets reached the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center: Saturn V was too powerful, too expensive, and too important to risk.</p><p>The stand\u2019s role didn\u2019t end with Apollo. In 1978, it became the first location where engineers integrated all space shuttle elements together: orbiter, external fuel tank, and solid rocket boosters assembled as one complete system. Its final mission came in the early 2000s, when it served as a drop tower for microgravity experiments, a far quieter purpose than its explosive origins.</p><p>Both facilities earned designations as National Historic Landmarks in 1985, recognition of their irreplaceable contributions to human spaceflight. That makes their demolition bittersweet but necessary. The structures are no longer safe, and maintaining aging facilities drains resources that could support current missions. Marshall is removing 19 obsolete structures as part of a broader campus transformation, creating a modern, interconnected facility ready for NASA\u2019s next chapter.</p><p>\u201cThese facilities helped NASA make history. While it is hard to let them go, they\u2019ve earned their retirement. The people who built and managed these facilities and empowered our mission of space exploration are the most important part of their legacy,\u201d said acting Marshall director Rae Ann Meyer in a statement.</p><p>NASA has worked to preserve that legacy. Detailed architectural drawings, photographs, and written histories now reside permanently in the Library of Congress. Auburn University created high-resolution digital models using <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar\" target=\"_blank\">LiDAR</a> and 360-degree photography, capturing the structures in exquisite detail before their destruction. These virtual archives ensure future generations can still appreciate the scale and engineering achievement these towers represented, even after the steel has been cleared away.</p>"

Getting Past Procrastination</a></h2><p>Across a decade working at hypergrowth tech companies like Meta and Pinterest, I constantly struggled with procrastination. I\u2019d be assigned an important project, but I simply couldn\u2019t get myself to start it. The source of my distraction varied\u2014I would constantly check my email, read random documentation, or even scroll through my social feeds. But the result was the same: I felt a deep sense of dread that I was not making progress on the things that mattered.</p><p>At the end of the day, time is the only resource that matters. With every minute, you are making a decision about how to spend your life. Most of the ways people spend their time are ineffective. Especially in the tech world, our tasks and tools are constantly changing, so we must be able to adapt. What separates the best engineers from the rest of the pack is that they create systems that allow them to be consistently productive.</p><p>Here\u2019s the core idea that changed my perspective on productivity: Action leads to motivation, not the other way around. You should not check your email or scroll Instagram while you wait for motivation to \u201chit you.\u201d Instead, just start doing something, anything, that makes progress toward your goal, and you\u2019ll find that motivation will follow.\u2026</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/getting-past-procastination\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/improving-interview-odds\" target=\"_blank\">2. Improve Your Chances of Landing That Job Interview</a></h2><p>One of my close friends is a hiring manager at Google. She recently posted about an open position on her team and was immediately overwhelmed with applications. We\u2019re talking about thousands of applicants within days.</p><p>What surprised me most, however, was the horrendous quality of the average submission. Most applicants were obviously unqualified or had concocted entirely fake profiles. The use of generative AI to automatically fill out (and, in some cases, even submit) applications is harmful to everyone; employers are unable to filter through the noise, and legitimate candidates have a harder time getting noticed\u2014much less advancing to an interview.</p><p>So how can job seekers stand out among the deluge of candidates? When there are hundreds or thousands of applicants, the best way to distinguish yourself is by leveraging your network.</p><p>With AI, anyone with a computer can trivially apply to thousands of jobs. On the other hand, people are restricted by Dunbar\u2019s number\u2014the idea that humans can maintain stable social relationships with only about 150 people. Being one of those 150 people is harder, but it also carries more weight than a soulless job application.</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/improving-interview-odds\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/learning-coding-age-of-ai\" target=\"_blank\">3.

That\u2019s one billion lines of production-grade code accepted by users every single day. If we generously assume that a strong engineer writes a thousand lines of code in a day, Cursor is doing the equivalent work of a million developers. (For context, while working at Pinterest and Meta, I\u2019d typically write less than 100 lines of code per day.)</p><p>There are only about 25 million software developers worldwide! Naively, it appears that Cursor is making a meaningful percentage of coders obsolete.</p><p>This begs the question: Is it even worth learning to code anymore?</p><p>The answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The above fear-based analysis of Cursor misses several important points.\u2026</p><p><em><em>Read the full newsletter </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/learning-coding-age-of-ai\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>here</em></em></a><em><em>. </em></em></p><p>\u2014Rahul<br /></p>"

These memory chips are placed as close as possible to the computing chips they serve in order to cut down on the biggest bottleneck in AI computing\u2014the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trillion-transistor-gpu\" target=\"_blank\">energy and delay</a> in getting billions of bits per second from memory into logic. But what if you could bring computing and memory even closer together by stacking the HBM on top of the GPU?</span></p><p> Imec recently explored this scenario using advanced thermal simulations, and the answer\u2014delivered in December at the <a href=\"https://www.ieee-iedm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">2025 IEEE International Electron Device Meeting</a> (IEDM)\u2014was a bit grim. 3D stacking doubles the operating temperature inside the GPU, rendering it inoperable. But the team, led by Imec\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-myers-3163a1143/?originalSubdomain=uk\" target=\"_blank\">James Myers</a>, didn\u2019t just give up. They identified several engineering optimizations that ultimately could whittle down the temperature difference to nearly zero.</p><h2>2.5D and 3D Advanced Packaging</h2><p>Imec started with a thermal simulation of a GPU and four HBM dies as you\u2019d find them today, inside what\u2019s called a 2.5D package. That is, both the GPU and the HBM sit on substrate called an interposer, with minimal distance between them. The two types of chips are linked by thousands of micrometer-scale copper interconnects built into the interposer\u2019s surface. In this configuration, the model GPU consumes 414 watts and reaches a peak temperature of just under 70 \u00b0C\u2014typical for a processor. The memory chips consume an additional 40 W or so and get somewhat less hot. The heat is removed from the top of the package by the kind of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">liquid cooling </a>that\u2019s become common in new AI data centers.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_blank\">Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever</a></p><p>\u201cWhile this approach is currently used, it does not scale well for the future\u2014especially as it blocks two sides of the GPU, limiting future GPU-to-GPU connections inside the package,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yukai-chen-88948675/\" target=\"_blank\">Yukai Chen</a>, a senior researcher at Imec, told engineers at IEDM. In contrast, \u201cthe 3D approach leads to higher bandwidth, lower latency.\u2026 The most important improvement is the package footprint.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, as Chen and his colleagues found, the most straightforward version of stacking, simply putting the HBM chips on top of the GPU and adding a block of blank silicon to fill in a gap at the center, shot up temperatures in the GPU to a scorching 140 \u00b0C\u2014well past a typical GPU\u2019s 80 \u00b0C limit.</p><h2>System Technology Co-optimization</h2><p>The Imec team set about trying a number of technology and system optimizations aimed at lowering the temperature. The first thing they tried was throwing out a layer of silicon that was now redundant. To understand why, you have to first get a grip on what HBM really is.</p><p>This form of memory is a stack of as many as 12 high-density DRAM dies. Each has been thinned down to tens of micrometers and is shot through with vertical connections. These thinned dies are stacked one atop another and connected by tiny<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_blank\"> balls of solder</a>, and this stack of memory is vertically connected to another piece of silicon, called the base die. The base die is a logic chip designed to multiplex the data\u2014pack it into the limited number of wires that can fit across the millimeter-scale gap to the GPU.</p><p>But with the HBM now on top of the GPU, there\u2019s no need for such a data pump. Bits can flow directly into the processor without regard for how many wires happen to fit along the side of the chip. Of course, this change means moving the memory control circuits from the base die into the GPU and therefore changing the processor\u2019s floorplan, says Myers. But there should be ample room, he suggests, because the GPU will no longer need the circuits used to demultiplex incoming memory data.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/keeping-chips-cool/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hot, Hot Future of Chips</a></p><p>Cutting out this middleman of memory cooled things down by only a little less than 4 \u00b0C. But, importantly, it should massively boost the bandwidth between the memory and the processor, which is important for another optimization the team tried\u2014slowing down the GPU.</p><p>That might seem contrary to the whole purpose of better AI computing, but in this case, it\u2019s an advantage. Large language models are what are called \u201cmemory-bound\u201d problems. That is, memory bandwidth is the main limiting factor. But Myers\u2019s team estimated 3D stacking HBM on the GPU would boost bandwidth fourfold. With that added headroom, even slowing the GPU\u2019s clock by 50 percent still leads to a performance win, while cooling everything down by more than 20 \u00b0C. In practice, the processor might not need to be slowed down quite that much. Increasing the clock frequency to 70 percent led to a GPU that was only 1.7 \u00b0C warmer, Myers says.</p><h2>Optimized HBM</h2><p>Another big drop in temperature came from making the HBM stack and the area around it more conductive. That included merging the four stacks into two wider stacks, thereby eliminating a heat-trapping region; thinning out the top\u2014usually thicker\u2014die of the stack; and filling in more of the space around the HBM with blank pieces of silicon to conduct more heat.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Chart showing 7 steps with temperatures listed on them.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4a274\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/chart-showing-7-steps-with-temperatures-listed-on-them.jpg?id=62861305&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Imec explored seven steps to reduce the thermal penalty of stacking memory on GPUs.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Source image: Imec</small></p><p>With all of that, the stack now operated at about 88 \u00b0C. One final optimization brought things back to near 70 \u00b0C. Generally, some 95 percent of a chip\u2019s heat is removed from the top of the package, where in this case water carries the heat away. But adding similar cooling to the underside as well drove the stacked chips down a final 17 \u00b0C.</p><p>Although the research presented at IEDM shows it might be possible, HBM-on-GPU isn\u2019t necessarily the best choice, Myers says. \u201cWe are simulating other system configurations to help build confidence that this is or isn\u2019t the best choice,\u201d he says. \u201cGPU-on-HBM is of interest to some in industry,\u201d because it puts the GPU closer to the cooling. But it would likely be a more complex design, because the GPU\u2019s power and data would have to flow vertically through the HBM to reach it.</p>"
