AGI makes it feasible to perform all economically valuable work using compute. I distinguish between bottleneck and supplementary work\u2014tasks that are essential versus non-essential for unhindered growth. As computational resources expand: (i) the economy automates all bottleneck work, (ii) some supplementary work may be left exclusively to humans, (iii) output becomes linear in compute and labor and its growth is driven by the expansion of compute, (iv) wages converge to the opportunity cost of computational resources required to reproduce human work, and (v) the share of labor income in GDP converges to zero."

We derive pricing formulas that depart from profit maximization by incorporating incentives to improve welfare and reduce labor disruptions. Using US data, we evaluate several scenarios. A welfarist firm that values both profit and welfare should price closer to marginal cost, as efficiency gains outweigh distributional concerns. A conservative firm focused on labor-market stability should price above the profit-maximizing level in the short run, especially when its AI may displace low-income workers. Overall, socially minded firms face a trade-off between expanding access to AI and the resulting loss in profits and labor market risks."

        "summary": "This paper demonstrates that ignoring the source of variation in tariff levels yields misleading conclusions regarding the effects of tariff changes. Specifically, we show that changes in the ad valorem equivalent (AVE) tariff are insufficient to quantify the magnitude or sign of the effect of tariff changes on economic outcomes. To illustrate this point, we construct the first database of annual US statutory tariffs from 1972 to 1988 and use it to explore the consequences of liberalization in the years spanning the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Decomposing the aggregate AVE into its statutory and endogenous components, we document two distinct liberalizations in our sample. Prior to 1979, inflation combines with specific tariffs to create an \u201caccidental liberalization\u201d, despite the absence of widespread statutory tariff changes. After 1979, endogenous changes in the composition of imports mask the large Tokyo Round statutory tariff liberalization. Generalizing an exact hat framework to accommodate specific tariffs, we show that inflation-driven reductions in AVEs account for roughly half of the tariff liberalization in our sample, but these changes ultimately reduce imports and welfare. Finally, we show that specific tariffs remain an important determinant of cross-sectional variation in AVEs: between 2000 and 2017, one-third to one-half of the annual cross-sectional variance in good-level AVEs is driven by variation in the AVE of specific tariffs."

        "summary": "Policymakers often cite the risk that inflation expectations might \u201cde-anchor\u201d as a key reason for responding forcefully to inflationary shocks. We develop a model to analyze this trade-off and to quantify the benefits of stable long-run inflation expectations. In our framework, households and firms are imperfectly informed about the central bank\u2019s objective and learn from its policy choices. Recognizing this interaction, the central bank raises interest rates more aggressively after adverse supply shocks and accepts short-run output costs to secure more stable inflation expectations. The strength of this reputation channel depends on how sensitive long-run inflation expectations are to surprises in interest rates. Using high-frequency identification, we estimate these elasticities for emerging and advanced economies and find large negative values for Brazil. We fit our model to these findings and use it to quantify how reputation building motives affect monetary policy decisions, and the role of central bank's credibility in promoting macroeconomic stability."

        "summary": "This paper studies the cost-effectiveness of targeted payroll taxes for stimulating labor demand. It uses rich administrative data to study the effects of an Italian reform that raised social security contributions for apprenticeship contracts but granted a substantial discount for firms with 9 employees or less. The discount does not increase demand for apprenticeship contracts. Instead, it subsidizes inframarginal hiring. This reform is not cost-effective. Point estimates imply that each million euros of foregone social security contributions supports the employment of 29 apprentices for one year and no permanent contracts (these estimates are not statistically different from zero)."

Combining data on county-level erosion, the historical geography of crop production, and crop-specific innovation, I document that in the wake of the environmental crisis, agricultural technology development was strongly and persistently re-directed toward more Dust Bowl-exposed crops and, within crops, toward bio-chemical and planting technologies that could directly mitigate economic losses from environmental distress. County-level exposure to Dust Bowl-induced innovation significantly dampened the effect of land erosion on agricultural land values and revenue. These results highlight the role of crises in spurring innovation and the importance of endogenous technological progress as an adaptive force in the face of disasters."

        "summary": "We ask to what extent the quantification of labor market power depends on the modeling of the long-term worker-firm employment relationship. We develop an oligopsony model with dynamic wage contracts. Workers decide whether and where to work, choosing among firms providing different amenities and solving a dynamic discrete choice labor supply problem with firm-specific human capital. As a result, firms optimally choose wage-tenure contracts to attract and retain workers. We find that such contracts mitigate firms' incentives to impose large instantaneous wage markdowns\u2014compared to standard static wage-setting models\u2014thereby reducing the share of socially inefficient worker-firm separations. As a consequence, we show that the empirical approaches based on \"sufficient statistics\" tend to overestimate the extent of labor market power: low levels of firm-specific labor supply elasticities do not necessarily indicate rent extraction, but instead reflect firms\u2019 ability to retain workers by offering long-term value through human capital accumulation."

AI is making warfare more precise and deadly amidst intransigent conflicts. AI companies are exploiting people in the global South who work as data labelers, and profiting from content creators worldwide by using their work without license or compensation. The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" target=\"_blank\">enormous energy demands</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, particularly in the United States, public investment in science seems to be <a href=\"https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/leading-research-universities-report/white-house-proposes-steep-cuts-science-and-education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>redirected</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/trump-plan-highlights-ai-for-science\" target=\"_blank\">concentrated</a> on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And Big Tech companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.</p><p>This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here\u2019s how.</p><h2>The Academy\u2019s View of AI <a target=\"_blank\"></a></h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Pew study</span></a> in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn\u2019t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 <a href=\"https://sci-ops.org/survey/artificial-intelligence-survey-x/scientists-perceptions-and-personal-use/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of generative AI in daily life\u2014by nearly a three to one ratio.</p><p>We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, cybersecurity, physical sciences, drug discovery, public health, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we\u2019ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we\u2019ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.</p><p>We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.</p><h2>Elements of a Positive Vision for AI</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/working-waterfront/hope-a-framework-for-climate-action/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7178677/climate-scientist-optimist-refuse-to-give-up-hope/\" target=\"_blank\">have</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">rgu</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">ed</a> <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that</a> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">turn</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ing</a> the <a href=\"https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/making-case-climate-optimism\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tide</a> of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.</p><p>There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples\u2019 lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.</p><p>Some examples: AI is eliminating communication barriers across languages, including under-resourced contexts like <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5230744\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>marginalized sign languages</span></a> and <a href=\"https://ojs.bilpub.com/index.php/card/article/view/517\" target=\"_blank\">indigenous African languages</a>. It is helping policymakers incorporate the viewpoints of many constituents through AI-assisted <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adq2852\" target=\"_blank\">deliberations</a> and <a href=\"https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legislative engagement</a>.

National labs are building AI <a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/cels/auroragpt-foundation-models-for-science\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">foundation models</a> to accelerate scientific research. And throughout the fields of medicine and biology, machine learning is solving scientific problems like the prediction of protein structure in aid of drug discovery, which was recognized with a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Prize</a> in 2024.</p><p>While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.</p><h2><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>A Call to Action for Scientists</h2><p>In our new book, <span><em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\">Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship</a></em></span><span>, we describe four key actions for policymakers committed to steering AI toward the public good.</span></p><p>These apply to scientists as well. Researchers should work to <strong>reform</strong> the AI industry to be more ethical, equitable, and trustworthy. We must collectively<a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"><span>develop</span></a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\">ethical</a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\">norms</a> for research that advance and applies AI, and should use and draw attention to AI developers who adhere to those norms. </p><p>Second, we should <strong>resist</strong> harmful uses of AI by documenting the negative applications of AI and casting a light on inappropriate uses. </p><p>Third, we should <strong>responsibly use</strong> AI to make society and peoples\u2019 lives better, exploiting its capabilities to help the communities they serve. </p><p>And finally, we must advocate for the <strong>renovation</strong> of institutions to prepare them for the impacts of AI; universities, professional societies, and democratic organizations are all vulnerable to disruption.</p><p>Scientists have a special privilege and responsibility: We are close to the technology itself and therefore well positioned to influence its trajectory. We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Melvin Kranzberg observed</span></a>, \u201cis neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today. But we cannot create a positive future without a vision of what it looks like.</p>"

Every leap\u2014whether it\u2019s smarter phones, more capable cars, or breakthroughs in healthcare and science\u2014relies on chips that are more complex, faster, and packed with more features than ever before. But creating these chips is not just a question of sheer engineering talent or ambition. The design process itself has reached staggering levels of complexity, and with it, the challenge to keep productivity and quality moving forward.</p><p>As we push against the boundaries of physics, chipmakers face more than just technical hurdles. The workforce challenges, tight timelines, and the requirements for building reliable chips are stricter than ever. Enormous effort goes into making sure chip layouts follow detailed constraints\u2014such as maintaining minimum feature sizes for transistors and wires, keeping proper spacing between different layers like metal, polysilicon, and active areas, and ensuring vias overlap correctly to create solid electrical connections. These design rules multiply with every new technology generation. For every innovation, there\u2019s pressure to deliver more with less. So, the question becomes: How do we help designers meet these demands, and how can technology help us handle the complexity without compromising on quality?</p><h2>Shifting the paradigm: the rise of AI in electronic design automation</h2><p>A major wave of change is moving through the entire field of electronic design automation (EDA), the specialized area of software and tools that chipmakers use to design, analyze, and verify the complex integrated circuits inside today\u2019s chips. Artificial intelligence is already touching many parts of the chip design flow\u2014helping with placement and routing, predicting yield outcomes, tuning analog circuits, automating simulation, and even guiding early architecture planning. Rather than simply speeding up old steps, AI is opening doors to new ways of thinking and working.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>Instead of brute-force computation or countless lines of custom code, AI uses advanced algorithms to spot patterns, organize massive datasets, and highlight issues that might otherwise take weeks of manual work to uncover. For example, generative AI can help designers ask questions and get answers in natural language, streamlining routine tasks. Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>This growing partnership between human expertise and machine intelligence is paving the way for what some call a \u201cshift left\u201d or concurrent build revolution\u2014finding and fixing problems much earlier in the design process, before they grow into expensive setbacks. For chipmakers, this means higher quality and faster time to market. For designers, it means a chance to focus on innovation rather than chasing bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Flow diagram: IC design rule checking (DRC), SoC integration, physical verification showing errors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c40c3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/flow-diagram-ic-design-rule-checking-drc-soc-integration-physical-verification-showing-errors.jpg?id=61784279&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 1.

Physical verification checks whether a chip layout meets the manufacturer\u2019s strict rules and faithfully matches the original functional schematic. Its main goal is to ensure the design can be reliably manufactured into a working chip, free of physical defects that might cause failures later on.</span></p><p>Design rule checking (DRC) is the backbone of physical verification. DRC software scans every corner of a chip\u2019s layout for violations\u2014features that might cause defects, reduce yield, or simply make the design un-manufacturable. But today\u2019s chips aren\u2019t just bigger; they\u2019re more intricate, woven from many layers of logic, memory, and analog components, sometimes stacked in three dimensions. The rules aren\u2019t simple either. They may depend on the geometry, the context, the manufacturing process and even the interactions between distant layout features.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man with wavy black hair in a black blazer and white shirt against a plain background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12f34\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-with-wavy-black-hair-in-a-black-blazer-and-white-shirt-against-a-plain-background.jpg?id=61784318&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Priyank Jain leads product management for Calibre Interfaces at Siemens EDA.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p>Traditionally, DRC is performed late in the flow, when all components are assembled into the final chip layout. At this stage, it\u2019s common to uncover millions of violations\u2014and fixing these late-stage issues requires extensive effort, leading to costly delays.</p><p>To minimize this burden, there\u2019s a growing focus on shifting DRC earlier in the flow\u2014a strategy called \u201cshift-left.\u201d Instead of waiting until the entire design is complete, engineers try to identify and address DRC errors much sooner at block and cell levels. This concurrent design and verification approach allows the bulk of errors to be caught when fixes are faster and less disruptive.</p><p>However, running DRC earlier in the flow on a full chip when the blocks are not DRC clean produces results datasets of breathtaking scale\u2014often tens of millions to billions of \u201cerrors,\u201d warnings, or flags because the unfinished chip design is \u201cdirty\u201d compared to a chip that\u2019s been through the full design process. Navigating these \u201cdirty\u201d results is a challenge all on its own. Designers must prioritize which issues to tackle, identify patterns that point to systematic problems, and decide what truly matters. In many cases, this work is slow and \u201cmanual,\u201d depending on the ability of engineers to sort through data, filter what matters, and share findings across teams.</p><p>To cope, design teams have crafted ways to limit the flood of information. They might cap the number of errors per rule, or use informal shortcuts\u2014passing databases or screenshots by email to team members, sharing filters in chat messages, and relying on experts to know where to look. Yet this approach is not sustainable. It risks missing major, chip-wide issues that can cascade through the final product. It slows down response and makes collaboration labor-intensive.</p><p>With ongoing workforce challenges and the surging complexity of modern chips, the need for smarter, more automated DRC analysis becomes urgent. So what could a better solution look like\u2014and how can AI help bridge the gap?</p><h2>The rise of AI-powered DRC analysis</h2><p>Recent breakthroughs in AI have changed the game for DRC analysis in ways that were unthinkable even a few years ago. Rather than scanning line by line or check by check, AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster. These tools use techniques from computer vision, advanced machine learning, and big data analytics to turn what once seemed like an impossible pile of information into a roadmap for action.</p><p>AI\u2019s ability to organize chaotic datasets\u2014finding systematic problems hidden across multiple rules or regions\u2014helps catch risks that basic filtering might miss. By grouping related errors and highlighting hot spots, designers can see the big picture and focus their time where it counts. AI-based clustering algorithms reliably transform weeks of manual investigation into minutes of guided analysis.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster.</p><p>Another benefit: collaboration. By treating results as shared, living datasets\u2014rather than static tables\u2014modern tools let teams assign owners, annotate findings and pass exact analysis views between block and partition engineers, even across organizational boundaries. Dynamic bookmarks and shared UI states cut down on confusion and rework. Instead of \u201cback and forth,\u201d teams move forward together.</p><p>Many of these innovations tease at what\u2019s possible when AI is built into the heart of the verification flow. Not only do they help designers analyze the results; they help everyone reason about the data, summarize findings and make better design decisions all the way to tape out.</p><h2>A real-world breakthrough in DRC analysis and collaboration: Siemens\u2019 Calibre Vision AI</h2><p>One of the most striking examples of AI-powered DRC analysis comes from <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a>, whose <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI platform</a> is setting new standards for how full-chip verification happens. Building on years of experience in physical verification, Siemens realized that breaking bottlenecks required not only smarter algorithms but rethinking how teams work together and how data moves across the flow.</p><p>Vision AI is designed for speed and scalability. It uses a compact error database and a multi-threaded engine to load millions\u2014or even billions\u2014of errors in minutes, visualizing them so engineers see clusters and hot spots across the entire die. Instead of a wall of error codes or isolated rule violations, the tool presents a heat map of the layout, highlighting areas with the highest concentration of issues. By enabling or disabling layers (layout, markers, heat map) and adjusting layer opacity, users get a clear, customizable view of what\u2019s happening\u2014and where to look next.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. </p><p>But the real magic is in AI-guided clustering. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. This means designers can attack the root cause once, fixing problems for hundreds of checks at a time instead of tediously resolving them one by one. In cases where legacy tools would force teams to slog through, for example, 3,400 checks with 600 million errors, Vision AI\u2019s clustering can reduce that effort to investigating just 381 groups\u2014turning mountains into molehills and speeding debug time by at least 2x.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Calibre Vision software, check groups, cells list, and die-view heatmap interface screenshot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ac191\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/calibre-vision-software-check-groups-cells-list-and-die-view-heatmap-interface-screenshot.jpg?id=61784282&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 2. The Calibre Vision AI software automates and simplifies the chip-level DRC verification process.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p><span>Vision AI is also highly collaborative. Dynamic bookmarks capture the exact state of analysis, from layer filters to zoomed layout areas, along with annotations and owner assignments. Sharing a bookmark sends a living analysis\u2014not just a static snapshot\u2014to coworkers, so everyone is working from the same view. Teams can export results databases, distribute actionable groups to block owners, and seamlessly import findings into other Siemens EDA tools for further debug.</span></p><h2>Empowering every designer: reducing the expertise gap</h2><p>A frequent pain point in chip verification is the need for deep expertise\u2014knowing which errors matter, which patterns mean trouble, and how to interpret complex results. Calibre Vision AI helps level the playing field. Its AI-based algorithms consistently create the same clusters and debug paths that senior experts would identify, but does so in minutes. New users can quickly find systematic issues and perform like seasoned engineers, helping chip companies address workforce shortages and staff turnover.</p><p>Beyond clusters and bookmarks, Vision AI lets designers build custom signals by leveraging their own data. The platform secures customer models and data for exclusive use, making sure sensitive information stays within the company. And by integrating with Siemens\u2019 EDA AI ecosystem, <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> supports generative AI chatbots and reasoning assistants. Designers can ask direct questions\u2014about syntax, about a signal, about the flow\u2014and get prompt\u2014accurate answers, streamlining training and adoption.</p><h2>Real results: speeding analysis and sharing insight</h2><p>Customer feedback from leading IC companies shows the real-world value of AI for full-chip DRC analysis and debug. One company reported that Vision AI reduced their debug effort by at least half\u2014a gain that makes the difference between tapeout and delay. Another noted the platform\u2019s signals algorithm automatically creates the same check groups that experienced users would manually identify, saving not just time but energy.</p><p>Quantitative gains are dramatic. For example, Calibre Vision AI can load and visualize error files significantly faster than traditional debug flows. Figure 3 shows the difference in four different test cases: a results file that took 350 minutes with the traditional flow, took Calibre Vision AI only 31 minutes. In another test case (not shown), it took just five minutes to analyze and cluster 3.2 billion errors from more than 380 rule checks into 17 meaningful groups. Instead of getting lost in gigabytes of error data, designers now spend time solving real problems.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar graph comparing traditional flow vs. Vision AI flow times at various nanometer scales.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2f678\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/bar-graph-comparing-traditional-flow-vs-vision-ai-flow-times-at-various-nanometer-scales.jpg?id=61784294&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 3.

As the need for speed, quality and collaboration continues to grow, the story of physical verification will be shaped by smarter, more adaptive technologies. With AI-powered DRC analysis, we see a clear path: a faster and more productive way to find systematic issues, intelligent debug, stronger collaboration and the chance for every designer to make an expert impact.</span></p><p>By combining the creativity of engineers with the speed and insight of AI, platforms like <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> are driving a new productivity curve in full-chip analysis. With these tools, teams don\u2019t just keep up with complexity\u2014they turn it into a competitive advantage.</p><p>At Siemens, the future of chip verification is already taking shape\u2014where intelligence works hand in hand with intuition, and new ideas find their way to silicon faster than ever before. As the industry continues to push boundaries and unlock the next generation of devices, AI will help chip design reach new heights.</p><p><em>For more on Calibre Vision AI and how Siemens is shaping the future of chip design, visit <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">eda.sw.siemens.com</a> and search for Calibre Vision AI.</em></p>"

Over the course of six decades, it has advanced through\u2014by our count\u2014three phases: first connecting computers, then mobile devices, and later all devices. But </span><span>that\u2019s</span> just the start. Because just ahead comes new frontiers of connected intelligence and then, later, </span><span>perception</span><span>. Last, we suggest, </span><span>represents</span> a kind of global or ubiquitous connectedness, and finally connectedness even down to the quantum scale. </p><p><span>Through every phase, connectivity has been the unifying principle, although with every successive phase also comes new </span><em><span><em>forms</em></span></em><span> of connection. The story begins with connected packets of data across fixed networks of big machines. Then comes mobility, along with broadly connecting all </span><span>manner</span> of machines\u2014not just mobile and fixed computing devices. Having already progressed through the first three Phases of the Internet (and having now entered the fourth), the world today has seen the steady expansion of human potential, while unlocking new industries, and reshaping how everyone connected to the Internet lives and works.  </p><p><span>With a nod to </span><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56966/speech-all-the-worlds-a-stage\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>Shakespeare\u2019s </span></span><em><span><em><span>As You Like It</span></em></span></em></a><span><span>, what follows is our sketch of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases. However, unlike the Bard\u2019s \u201c7 ages of man,\u201d each of the Internet\u2019s eras do not come to an end when the next one starts. The Internet\u2019s 7 Phases, in other words, are not sequential but rather additive. Each phase builds on and extends the </span><span>previous</span><span>, in the process setting the foundation for what is still to come.</span></span> </p><h2>Phase 1: The Internet </h2><p><span>The original Internet was conceived in the 1970s to interconnect computer networks. Its groundbreaking aspect lay not only in its architecture but also in the principle of openness. By adopting </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/todays-internet-still-relies-on-an-arpanetera-protocol-the-request-for-comments\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>common protocols</span></span></a><span>, diverse networks could connect regardless of their location. The Internet has transformed isolated systems into a \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d enabling unprecedented collaboration across institutions and borders. </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/write-and-wrong\">Early applications</a> such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/computer-networking\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>email and file transfer</span></span></a> <span>demonstrated</span> that connectivity could democratize access to information. </p><p><span>In the early 1990s, the </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fathers-of-the-internet-revolution-urge-todays-pioneers-to-reinvent-the-web\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>World Wide Web</span></span></a> introduced a unifying framework: URLs as addresses, HTTP for communication, HTML as a common language, and the browser as a universal interface. Between <a href=\"https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>1991 and \u201893</span></span></a><span>, the Web transformed the Internet from a research network into a global platform for information exchange, paving the way for broader adoption. </span> </p><h2>Phase 2: The Mobile Internet </h2><p><span>The next big leap involved mobility.</span> <a href=\"https://icons8.com/blog/articles/what-was-the-internet-of-the-early-2000s/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>In the early to mid-2000s</span></span></a><span>, as mobile Internet devices spread and smartphones matured, connectivity turned portable. The Internet was no longer tethered to desktops; it traveled in pockets, purses, and messenger bags. </span> </p><p><span><span>The Internet\u2019s newfound portability connected billions of people around the world for the first time, reshaping communication, commerce, and entertainment. Social networks </span><span>flourished,</span> mobile payments reached those without access to traditional banking, and services like </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>ridesharing</span></span></a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-algorithms-that-make-instacart-roll\" target=\"_blank\">food delivery</a> became everyday conveniences. Connectivity had transformed from being deskbound and centered around one\u2019s PC to becoming an always-on, portable, digital resource network woven into daily life. The <a href=\"https://actonline.org/2021/04/07/a-brief-history-of-time-the-app-stores/\" target=\"_blank\"><span><span>app economy</span></span></a> soon followed, where any service or application could be accessed instantly at our fingertips. </p><h2>Phase 3: The Internet of Things (IoT) </h2><p><span>Connectivity expanded beyond PCs and mobile devices to all digital devices with any networking capability, creating today\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>Internet of Things</span></span></a><span> (IoT). Sensors, appliances, and other devices in homes, factories, cars, and cities </span><span>stream</span> telemetry data around the clock, turning the Internet into an invisible nervous system linking the physical and digital worlds. The IoT has opened new possibilities in healthcare, manufacturing, <span>logistics</span><span>, and agriculture such as connected tractors and soil sensors that enable smart farming, boosting yields while conserving resources.</span> </p><h2>Phase 4: The Internet of AI Agents  </h2><p><span>The most profound shift now underway is the rise of </span><span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agent-economy\" target=\"_blank\">AI agents</a>.</span><span> Unlike IoT devices that merely </span><span>transmit</span> data, agents can <span>perceive, reason, act, and collaborate<strong>.</strong></span><span> They are no longer passive </span><span>endpoints</span> but rather independent actors shaping digital and physical economies. </p><p><span>Two dimensions define this phase:</span> </p><ul><li><span><strong>Digital AI agents:</strong></span><span> This category includes software-based entities such as coding copilots, digital assistants, workflow </span><span>orchestrators,</span> and trading algorithms. They live in the digital world but shape economies and <span>services</span>. Consider, for instance, a coding copilot that <span>assists</span> developers and collaborates with other agents to debug, refactor, and <span>optimize</span> software in real time. </li></ul><ul><li><span><strong>Physical AI agents:</strong></span><span> By contrast, physical AI agents are systems that </span><span>operate</span> across both digital and physical environments such as autonomous vehicles, drones, industrial robots, and medical devices. A self-driving car that fuses <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar-on-a-chip\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>lidar</span></span></a><span>, radar, and </span><span>ISAC (<a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2024/6/integrated-sensing-and-communication\" target=\"_blank\">Integrated Sensing and Communications</a>)</span><span> is one increasingly prominent type of physical AI agent today. This agent detects its environment, avoids collisions, and coordinates with nearby vehicles and traffic systems. ISAC functions here as part of the vehicle, supplying the instant-by-instant environmental awareness that allows the car to navigate without human control.</span></li></ul><p><span>We call Phase 4 not just the era of AI agents but rather the \u201cInternet of AI Agents.\u201d This is because value arises not from isolated intelligence but from </span><span>networked intelligence.</span> Agents will communicate, collaborate, and coordinate in real time across networks on Earth and in the oceans and skies and beyond, creating new forms of productivity, trust, and resilience. </p><h2>Phase 5: The Internet of Senses </h2><p><span>If Phase 4 brought intelligence through agents, the next step of Internet integration is </span><span><span>perception</span>.</span> The Internet of Senses extends connectivity from exchanging information to exchanging <span>experiences<strong>.</strong></span> </p><p><span>Two dimensions define this phase:</span> </p><ul><li><span><strong>Multisensory communication</strong></span> expands the network\u2019s palate beyond just text, audio, and video. In the age of the Internet of Senses, networks will carry signals that convey the modalities of touch, taste, and smell. Advances in haptic wearables, digital olfaction, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) will allow a shopper to \u201cfeel\u201d the texture of clothing online or \u201csmell\u201d perfume before buying. In healthcare, doctors will remotely examine patients using haptic gloves that transmit the sense of feeling. Meanwhile, education will become more immersive, enabling students to explore history or science through tactile and sensory experiences. </li></ul><ul><li><span><strong>ISAC at the network level:</strong></span> Unlike the era of AI agents, where intelligence came embedded with its own sensing and communications systems, here the <span>network is the thing doing the perceiving<strong>.</strong></span> Programmable surfaces and meta-materials will shape signals, enabling motion detection, distance measurement, and localization as part of system communications. Smart cities, for instance, will detect traffic flow and crowd movement in real time, feeding its own \u201csenses\u201d of the environment directly into its network. </li></ul><p><span>The Internet of Senses will make connectivity </span><span>immersive and context-aware,</span> enriching how humans and machines interact and laying the foundation for embodied intelligence in the physical world. </p><h2>Phase 6: The Ubiquitous Internet </h2><p><span>As billions of devices and AI agents come online, the importance of seamless coverage ramps up. Phase 6, the Ubiquitous Internet, addresses this network-level need by integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial infrastructures like cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, local area networks, fiber, satellites, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/6g-wireless\" target=\"_blank\">high-altitude platforms</a> into one unified global network.</span> </p><p><span><span>Ultimately, a</span> Ubiquitous Internet will ensure connectivity everywhere across remote villages, open oceans, skies, orbit, cislunar space, and beyond. This wide-scale network will underpin the next advances in autonomy, </span><span>perception</span><span>, and intelligence, enabling AI agents and human users alike to </span><span>operate</span> without borders. </p><h2>Phase 7: The Quantum Internet  </h2><p><span>The final frontier in connectivity will be the Quantum Internet, where quantum communication, networking, sensing, and computing converge. Unlike the classical Internet, which transmits bits, the Quantum Internet distributes </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-quantum-entanglement\" target=\"_self\"><span><span>qubits</span></span></a><span> through entanglement and teleportation, enabling capabilities beyond anything conventional systems can achieve. Early demonstrations are already showing </span><span>the Quantum</span> Internet\u2019s potential. Entangled qubits transmitted over optical fibers and satellites will one day create ultra-secure communication channels, resistant to interception, while quantum sensors achieve <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vacuum-measurement\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented precision</a> in measuring time, motion, and the environment. These innovations will together open possibilities such as navigation without GPS and ultra-sensitive environmental monitoring.  </p><p><span><span>Greater still </span><span>is</span> the promise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-networks-cisco-quantum-computing\" target=\"_blank\">quantum networking</a>, which will interconnect distributed quantum processors into one planetary-scale connected computer system. AI systems will run across multiple quantum computers at once, working together on the same sets of problems. Expect integrated quantum AI systems, for example, to speed up the creation of new medicines and to optimize routes for complicated supply and delivery chains.</span></p><p><span>The Quantum Internet will not replace the classical Internet but augment it, overlaying quantum signals with classical bits. Just as the Internet of Agents put intelligence in motion, the Quantum Internet will supercharge that intelligence by embedding it with the laws of physics at the smallest scales: weaving together sensing, security, computation, and AI into a single global system of connectivity.</span></p><h2>Comparing the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases  </h2><p><span><span>Taken together, the 7 Phases of the Internet above tell how connectivity has expanded </span><span>from workstations and mainframes</span> to mobile devices to people and the physical world. We have drawn lessons from the first three phases to forecast several new phases ahead: involving networked integration of AI agents, senses, everything in the classical world, and finally down into the quantum realm as well. To highlight how each phase is built on the last, what follows is a side-by-side view of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases:</span></p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-cards\"><noscript><img alt=\"cards visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25618132/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p><span>As the above illustrates, the Internet\u2019s evolution has been both </span><span>vertical and horizontal.</span><span> Vertically, each phase has added new layers of capability from hosts to people to devices to agents, building on the shared foundation of connectivity. Horizontally, new paradigms have often run </span><span>in parallel</span><span> with existing ones: fixed and mobile networks </span><span>coexisted,</span><span> IoT expanded alongside human communication. And in the future, quantum channels will share the same fiber as classical signals on different wavelengths.</span></p><p><span>The combination of layering and parallel expansion has made the Internet resilient, scalable, and continuously transformative. Meanwhile, at every stage, connectivity has adapted to new demands\u2014enabling the Internet to be not just a network of endpoints but a<strong> </strong></span><span>fabric of fabrics,</span> supporting diversity while fostering integration. </p><p><span><span>Each phase of the Internet\u2014from networks to people to things to agents to senses to ubiquity to the quantum world\u2014has extended and will continue to extend the foundation of connectivity. Each of the Internet\u2019s 7 Phases overcomes the limits of the </span><span>previous</span> phase, while also opening new frontiers. </span> </p><p><span><span>Even as the Internet </span><span>enters into</span> Phase 4, long gone is its limited mandate of merely moving data packets. The Internet is today and over its future phases becoming the intelligent, resilient, and universal fabric upon which the world\u2019s digital future rests. And in the age of AI, connectivity is not merely the foundation. It is increasingly </span><span>intelligence itself.</span></p>"

We can\u2019t control who our manager is, but we can shape that relationship to better work for us.</span></p><p>Managing up is an important skill, and something I didn\u2019t even realize I could do until I was a Senior Engineer at Facebook. I could have unlocked considerably more career support and investment if I had worked better with my manager.</p><p>Here are three core ideas that made a meaningful impact on how I approach my manager relationship: </p><p>First, understand your manager\u2019s motivations. Many early-career engineers are completely clueless about how their managers are evaluated. Ultimately, your manager is assessed on the overall impact of their team. Your manager will often spend time giving feedback to reports and ensuring engineers are unblocked. But they may also need to remove people from the team or cancel projects. You need to determine what your manager cares about and how your work fits into their priorities.</p><p>Second, understand your boss\u2019s preferred communication style. Many software projects come with a README file that describes how to use them. Imagine you had to write a README file for your manager: the need-to-know information to best interact with them. This document would include their preferences and pet peeves around communication, their preferred work environments, and their strengths and weaknesses. Once you have a README file, either something you wrote on behalf of your manager or something you collaboratively put together with your manager\u2019s input, apply it to your interactions.</p><p>Finally, figure out how to work productively with your manager as you plan your tasks. Instead of asking how you can get involved in something new, bring value. Provide data, insights, or proposals that move the conversation forward, rather than simply waiting for an assignment. Also, no manager wants to deal with surprises. Ensure that you communicate ahead of any surprises, and you\u2019ve thought about next steps when things inevitably go wrong. </p><p>You can control, at least partially, your manager\u2019s investment in you. This is not about after-work drinks or political maneuvering \u2014 managing up is a critical skill for career advancement, whether we do it consciously or not. </p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">Talent Shortage Threatens Energy Sector\u2019s Future</a></h2><p>We need more power engineers.

But beneath that smooth experience, the system is quietly generating a dense digital trail of personal data.</span></p><p>That\u2019s the hidden cost of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">agentic AI</a> (systems that don\u2019t just answer questions, but perceive, plan, and act on your behalf). Every plan, prompt, and action gets logged; caches and forecasts accumulate; traces of daily routines settle into long-lived storage.</p><p>These records aren\u2019t sloppy mistakes\u2014they\u2019re the default behavior of most agentic AI systems. The good news is that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Simple engineering habits can maintain autonomy and efficiency while dramatically shrinking the data footprint.<strong></strong></p><h2>How AI Agents Collect and Store Personal Data<strong></strong></h2><p>During its first week, our hypothetical home optimizer impresses. Like many agentic systems, it uses a planner based on a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models\" target=\"_blank\">large language model</a> (LLM) to coordinate familiar devices throughout the house. It monitors electricity prices and weather data, adjusts thermostats, toggles smart plugs, tilts blinds to reduce glare and heat, and schedules EV charging. The home becomes easier to manage and more economical.</p><p>To reduce sensitive data, the system stores only pseudonymous resident profiles locally and doesn\u2019t access cameras or microphones. It updates its plan when prices or weather shift, and logs short, structured reflections to improve the next week\u2019s run.</p><p>But the home\u2019s residents have no idea how much personal data is being collected behind the scenes. Agentic AI systems generate data as a natural consequence of how they operate. And in most baseline agent configurations, that data accumulates. While not considered best practice in the industry, such a configuration is a pragmatic starting point for getting an AI agent up and running quickly.</p><p>A careful review reveals the extent of the digital trail.</p><p>By default, the optimizer keeps detailed logs of both instructions given to the AI and its actions\u2014what it did, and where and when. It relies on broad, long-term access permissions to devices and data sources, and stores information from its interactions with these external tools. Electricity prices and weather forecasts are cached, temporary in-memory computations pile up over the course of a week, and short reflections meant to fine-tune the next run can build up into long-lived behavioral profiles. Incomplete deletion processes often leave fragments behind.</p><p>On top of that, many smart devices collect their own usage data for analytics, creating copies outside of the AI system itself. The result is a sprawling digital trail, spread across local logs, cloud services, mobile apps, and monitoring tools\u2014far more than most households realize.</p><h2>Six Ways to Reduce AI Agents\u2019 Data Trails<br /></h2><p>We don\u2019t need a new design doctrine\u2014just disciplined habits that reflect how agentic systems operate in the real world.</p><p>The first practice is constraining memory to the task at hand. For the home optimizer, this means limiting working memory to a single week\u2019s run. Reflections are structured, minimal, and short-lived, so they can improve the next run without accumulating into a dossier of household routines. The AI works only within its time and task limits, and the select pieces of data that persist have clear expiration markers.</p><p>Second, deletion should be easy and thorough. Every plan, trace, cache, embedding, and log is tagged with the same run ID so that a single \u201cdelete this run\u201d command propagates through all local and cloud storage and then provides confirmation. A separate, minimal audit trail (necessary for accountability) retains only essential event metadata under its own expiration clock.</p><p>Third, access to devices should be carefully limited through temporary, task-specific permissions. A home optimizer could receive short-lived \u201ckeys\u201d for only the needed actions\u2014adjusting a thermostat, turning a plug on or off, or scheduling an EV charger. These keys expire quickly, preventing overreach and reducing the data that must be stored.</p><p>Next, the agent\u2019s actions must be visible through a readable \u201c<a href=\"https://sierra.ai/blog/agent-traces\" target=\"_blank\">agent trace</a>.\u201d This interface shows what was planned, what ran, where data flowed, and when each piece of data will be erased. Users should be able to export the trace or delete all data from a run easily, and the information should be presented in plain language.</p><p>The fifth good habit is enforcing a policy of always using the least intrusive method of data collection. So if our household optimizer, dedicated to energy efficiency and comfort, can infer occupancy from passive motion-detection or door sensors, the system must not escalate to video (for example, grabbing a security-camera snapshot). Such escalation is prohibited unless it\u2019s strictly necessary and no equally effective, less intrusive alternative exists.</p><p>Finally, mindful observability limits how the system monitors itself. The agent logs only essential identifiers, avoids storing raw sensor data, caps how much and how often information is recorded, and disables third-party analytics by default. And every piece of stored data has a clear expiration time.</p><p>Together, these practices reflect well-established <a href=\"https://www.onetrust.com/blog/gdpr-principles/\" target=\"_blank\">privacy principles</a>: purpose limitation, data minimization, access and storage limitation, and accountability.</p><h2>What a Privacy-First AI Agent Looks Like</h2><p>It\u2019s possible to preserve autonomy and functionality while dramatically shrinking the data trail.</p><p>With these six habits, the home optimizer continues to precool, shade, and charge on schedule. But the system interacts with fewer devices and data services, copies of logs and cached data are easier to track, all stored data has a clear expiration date, and the deletion process provides a user-visible confirmation. A single trace page summarizes intent, actions, destinations, and retention time for each data item.</p><p>These principles extend beyond home automation. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use\" target=\"_blank\">Fully online AI agents</a>, such as travel planners that read calendars and manage bookings, operate on the same plan-act-reflect loop, and the same habits can be applied.</p><p>Agentic systems don\u2019t need a new theory of privacy. What matters is aligning engineering practices with how these AI systems actually operate. Ultimately, we need to design AI agents that respect privacy and responsibly manage data. By thinking now about agents\u2019 digital trails, we can build systems that serve people without taking ownership of their data.</p>"

The suitcase-sized system is packed with tech that captures eruptions at hundreds of frames per second, synchronously recording their roar and their heat.</p><p>Filming and analyzing an explosive eruption up close for hours, while capturing data about its heat, sound, and motion, has historically been tricky and dangerous. But that\u2019s the data scientists need to understand how eruptions work and evolve over time. SKATE makes that process both safer and simpler by autonomously recording synchronized streams of observatory data and minimizing the time researchers need to spend on a volcano\u2019s slopes.</p><p>\u201cExplosive eruptions are extremely fast processes with particles the size of a truck or a grain of dust that can travel from a few meters per second to supersonic speeds,\u201d says <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=daGGblwAAAAJ&amp;hl=it\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Jacopo Taddeucci</span></a>, a senior researcher at INGV. \u201cYou need cameras shooting hundreds of frames per second and instruments that can see, hear, and feel the eruption at once to understand cause and effect.\u201d</p><p>Aside from Stromboli, SKATE has been tested on the nearby <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Etna\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Mount Etna</span></a>, as well as on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_de_Fuego\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Guatemala\u2019s Fuego</span></a> and <a href=\"https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=342030\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Santiaguito volcanoes</span></a>.

The two companies<strong> </strong>followed INGV\u2019s specifications to pack an entire observatory into a rigid polypropylene shell on a \u20ac50,000 (about US $58,000) budget.</p><p>SKATE is the streamlined successor to an earlier INGV prototype known as FAMoUS (Fast Multiparametric Setup), which first proved the value of combining high-speed, thermal, and acoustic sensors. But it also came with serious drawbacks: It was heavy and bulky, took a long time to install on site, and required manual triggering, which forced researchers to spend hours in hazardous zones to capture only a handful of sequences.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"An opened suitcase containing a thermal camera, waterproof PC, sensors and data drives.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6d4b3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-opened-suitcase-containing-a-thermal-camera-waterproof-pc-sensors-and-data-drives.jpg?id=62005081&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">SKATE is more portable and easier to deploy than its predecessor, a system called FAMoUS.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci</small></p><p>Inside SKATE, a <a href=\"https://dewesoft.com/products/sbox-waterproof\" target=\"_blank\"><span>waterproof PC</span></a> coordinates a thermal camera recording at 32 frames per second, and a <a href=\"https://dewesoft.com/products/video-cameras/tech-specs#overview\" target=\"_blank\"><span>high-speed camera</span></a> that records bursts of footage when it detects sudden temperature spikes. Continuous 4K video capture would, in fact, quickly swamp SKATE\u2019s data storage, as a single day of 4K recording would require 100 times as much memory as SKATE has.</p><p>\u201cThe real challenge wasn\u2019t plugging in cameras and sensors,\u201d says <a href=\"https://dewesoft.com/blog/alessia-longo\" target=\"_blank\">Alessia Longo</a>, an engineer at Dewesoft. \u201cIt was forcing them to write into a single, perfectly synchronized file, and taming the data flood.\u201d</p><p><span>That data is stored on two SSDs with a total capacity of up to 6 terabytes, and the system operates autonomously for a full day in good weather, relying on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/solar-panels-micro-cpv\" target=\"_blank\">solar panels</a> and replaceable batteries.</span></p><p><span></span>\u201cThe creativity of a volcanologist lies in the ability to take technologies developed for other industries, like high-speed cameras used in sports events or military thermal imagers, and adapt them for scientific research on active volcanoes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/ingv.it/scarlato/home\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Piergiorgio Scarlato</span></a>, INGV\u2019s research director.</p><h2>Modular Design Enhances Volcanic Monitoring</h2><p>Placed between 300 and 900 meters from Stromboli\u2019s active vents, SKATE runs almost entirely on its own. Researchers only hike up once a day to swap batteries and memory cards. </p><p>The design is also modular. Alongside the thermal, high-speed, and acoustic sensors, INGV is now testing SKATE with a UV camera to quantify <a href=\"https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/stories/so2-volcanoes\" target=\"_blank\"><span>sulfur dioxide</span></a> emissions. It\u2019s also testing a laser rangefinder that provides distances to volcano\u2019s plume or crater rim, or moving slopes ten times per second. It can also provide analysis of individual lava bombs and rock fragments ejected during eruptions, allowing for precise reconstructions of their trajectories and landing areas.</p><p>\u201cDepth is what turns a spectacular image into a measurement,\u201d says Scarlato \u201cBy understanding how volcanic projectiles are launched, how far they travel, and where they fall, we can better assess the impact of eruptions on people, infrastructure, and the surrounding environment.\u201d</p><p>On Stromboli, the INGV team has analyzed more than a thousand explosions recorded between 2019 and 2024, matching high-speed videos, temperatures, and sound. Each vent, they discovered, develops its own personality: gas-rich jets sound softer and linger longer, while volcanic bombs\u2014chunks of lava flung out during an eruption\u2014and ash-rich blasts roar briefly and hurl incandescent fragments higher into the air.</p><h2>SKATE\u2019s Role in Volcanic Data Analysis</h2><p>SKATE isn\u2019t a 24/7 alarm. It\u2019s too complex and data-hungry to stream from a crater rim in real time. Instead, it helps fixed monitoring networks located farther from the crater\u2014such as thermal cameras, infrasound arrays, and other instruments\u2014to make better sense of their signals.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A helmeted researcher writing notes on a mountainside.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"555a2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-helmeted-researcher-writing-notes-on-a-mountainside.jpg?id=62005118&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A researcher uses SKATE to monitor a volcano.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Piergiorgio Scarlato and Jacopo Taddeucci</small></p><p>Data from SKATE is helping scientists <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-20900-2\" target=\"_blank\"><span>test hypotheses </span></a>about how gas bubbles rise and burst inside magma, how volcanic conduits are shaped, and study subsurface processes that ordinary monitoring can\u2019t see. INGV aims to turn some recurring patterns into reference libraries that could train automated systems to recognize early warning signs in live data streams.</p><p>SKATE\u2019s success is changing how volcanologists monitor active volcanoes for warning signs. But volcanoes will never be truly predictable or safe environments. Humidity often corrodes cables and steams camera lenses. During one recent deployment, a goat ate the microphone cable. And in a recent on Stromboli, INGV experimented with a new black and white high-speed sensor, ideal for tracking glowing bombs at night proved trickier than expected, as Stromboli\u2019s bursts last only a few seconds and make it difficult for the sensor to focus on them.</p><p>Despite the hurdles, the rapid, detailed data SKATE provides is welcome. \u201cWorking in such extreme conditions, with humidity, gases, and sudden temperature changes, is the real test for any technology,\u201d says Scarlato. \u201cThe difference now is that our interventions last minutes, not hours.\u201d</p>"

The company and other firms\u2014including <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/fervo-sage-partner-large-companies-tech\" target=\"_blank\">Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/xgs-energy-advanced-tech-scale-up-meta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>XGS</span> Energy</a>\u2014are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.</p><p>The industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.</p><h2>Eavor\u2019s Geothermal Breakthrough in Germany </h2><p>Eavor began drilling in Geretsried in July <span>2023</span>, shortly after winning a <a href=\"https://eavor.com/press-releases/eavors-next-generation-geothermal-project-awarded-916-million-grant-from-the-european-innovation-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">$<span>107</span> million grant</a> from the European Union\u2019s Innovation Fund. For its first <span>\u201c</span>loop,\u201d the company drilled two vertical wells reaching nearly <span>2</span>.<span>8</span> miles below the surface, then created a dozen horizontal wells\u2014like tines of a fork\u2014that each stretch <span>1</span>.<span>8</span> miles long. Once in place, the wells are connected underground and sealed off so that they operate like radiators: As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the rocks and brings it to the surface.</p><p>Operations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans to begin construction on its second loop in March <span>2026</span>. All told, the system will supply <span>8</span>.<span>2</span> megawatts of electricity to the regional grid and <span>64</span> <span>MW</span> of district heating to nearby towns, operating flexibly to provide more heat during chilly winter months and produce more electricity in summer. </p><p><span>In its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over </span><span>100</span><span> days to complete\u2014a major expense in an industry where drilling rigs can cost about $</span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span>000</span><span> a day to run. But the company said it improved its techniques and adapted its equipment in ways that reduced the drilling time for the remaining four wells by </span><span>50 percent</span><span>.</span></p><p>For example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.</p><p>On top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor\u2019s thermal-energy output per loop by about <span>35 percent</span>, Vany said.</p><p>The Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/geothermal-energy\" target=\"_blank\">other next-generation approaches</a>\u2014like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/fervo-energy-breaks-ground-on-next-generation-geothermal-plant\" target=\"_blank\">building in Utah</a> and <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/americas-first-enhanced-geothermal-plant-just-got-up-and-running\" target=\"_blank\">operating in Nevada</a>\u2014are also scaling up.</p><h2>Challenges in Geothermal Drilling</h2><p>Enhanced geothermal involves <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/geothermal-energy\" target=\"_blank\">fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids</a> to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater\u2014though experts say that\u2019s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.</p><p>But the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said <a href=\"https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/jefferson-w-tester/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Tester,</a> a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell\u2019s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>While companies developing closed-loop systems can make them work, the main challenge they face is for fluid temperatures and flow rates to be high enough to pay off economically,\u201d Tester said. <span>\u201c</span>You can get energy out of the ground; it\u2019s just, how much can you sustainably and affordably produce from a single closed-loop well connection?\u201d</p><p>Vany said that Eavor\u2019s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the <span>\u201c</span>levelized cost of heat\u201d in Europe, which estimates the average cost of providing a unit of heat over the lifetime of the project. That figure can fluctuate between $<span>50</span> and $<span>100</span> per megawatt-hour thermal in the region\u2019s volatile energy market, she said.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>After we\u2019ve drilled those first four loops, we will be at the bottom of the learning curve,\u201d Vany added. <span>\u201c</span>And that\u2019s the purpose of the Geretsried project.\u201d<br /></p>"

Moore explained to me between bites of a cold tongue sandwich at the 2nd Ave Deli, near <em><em>IEEE</em></em> <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s office, better thermal management is essential for next-generation nodes.</p><p>\u201cAs we start doing more 3D chips, the heat problem gets much worse,\u201d said Moore, who has been covering semiconductors on and off for a quarter century.</p><p>For the special report in this issue, Moore teamed up with Associate Editor Dina Genkina, who oversees our computing coverage. They talked to engineers at IEEE conferences like <a href=\"https://www.ieee-iedm.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEDM</a> and <a href=\"https://supercomputing.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Supercomputing</a> about how technologists are getting the heat out in new and surprising ways.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cAs we start doing more 3D chips, the heat problem gets much worse.\u201d <strong>\u2014Samuel K. Moore</strong></span></p><p>The first step to solving an engineering problem is characterizing it precisely. In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_blank\">Will Heat Cause a Moore\u2019s Law Meltdown?</a>\u201d, James Myers, of Imec in Cambridge, England, describes how transistors entering commercial production in the 2030s will have a power density that raises temperatures by 9 \u00b0C. In data centers where hot chips are crammed together by the millions, this increase could force hardware to shut down or risk permanent damage.</p><p>In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">Next-Gen AI Needs Liquid Cooling</a>\u201d, Genkina takes readers on a deep dive into four contenders to beat this heat with liquids: cold plates with a circulating water-glycol mixture attached directly to the hottest chips; a version of that tech in which a specialized dielectric fluid boils into vapor; dunking entire servers in tanks filled with dielectric oil; and doing the same in tanks of boiling dielectric fluid.</p><p>Although liquid cooling works well, \u201cit\u2019s also more expensive and introduces additional points of failure,\u201d Moore cautioned. \u201cBut when you\u2019re consuming kilowatts and kilowatts in such a small space, you do what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>As mind-blowing as servers in boiling oil may seem, the two other articles in this issue focus on even more radical cooling technologies. One involves using lasers to cool chips. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/laser-cooling-chips\" target=\"_blank\">The technique, outlined by Jacob Balma and Alejandro Rodriguez from the Minnesota-based startup Maxwell Labs</a>, involves converting phonons (vibrations in a crystal lattice that carry heat) into photons that can be piped away. The authors contend that their technique \u201ccan target hot spots as they form, with laser precision.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Stanford\u2019s Srabanti Chowdhury takes a blanket approach to the heat problem, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/diamond-thermal-conductivity\" target=\"_blank\">swaddling transistors in a polycrystalline diamond film</a>. Her team\u2019s technology has progressed remarkably fast, reducing diamond-film growth temperatures from 1,000 \u00b0C to less than 400 \u00b0C, making it compatible with standard CMOS manufacturing.</p>None of these solutions comes cheap, and so the future of chips is going to be expensive as well as hot. That probably doesn\u2019t faze the big AI companies sitting on giant piles of investors\u2019 cash. As Moore pointed out as he polished off a pickle, \u201cAI\u2019s demand for chips is sort of unlimited, so you\u2019ve got to do things that you wouldn\u2019t have thought of doing before and swallow the expense.<strong>\u201d </strong>"

Designed to convert your bank account into our dividends.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps you\u2019re wondering why you never heard of such an honest car executive. That\u2019s because he existed only in Hollywood. The lines come from the opening scene of the 1954 drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBbbgttdqBQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Woman\u2019s World</em></em></a>, in which three businessmen\u2014with a generous assist from their wives\u2014vie to become the next general manager of the fictitious Gifford Motors.</p><h2>What Was the Ford X-100 Concept Car? </h2><p>Onscreen shenanigans aside, the luxury car featured in the film was the real deal: the Ford X-100 concept car. An early version debuted at the Chicago Auto Show in early 1952. The two-door convertible on display had no engine, gears, or gadgets, but its exterior, likely made of plaster and fiberglass, resembled a rocket ship, which was the intention of designer Joe Oros.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of an exceptionally clean automobile engine.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f8012\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-an-exceptionally-clean-automobile-engine.jpg?id=61951875&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100\u2019s V-8 engine featured a three-speed automatic transmission.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>Over the next year and a half, Ford engineers, led by Hiram Pacific, spent at least US $2 million (about $24 million today) turning the display model into a fully functional car. Paul Adams was chief electrical engineer and in charge of most of the gadgets; Paul Wagner was the electrical engineer tasked with making the electrical system work. By the time they were done, the car contained 302 kilograms of electrical equipment, including a 12-volt ignition system, an extra-large generator, 24 electrical motors, 44 vacuum tubes, 50 lightbulbs, 92 control switches, 29 solenoids, 53 relays, 23 circuit breakers, and 10 fuses, all connected by 16 kilometers of wiring. That\u2019s a lot of electronics, but then again, a lot of gizmos were jammed into the car. Touted as a \u201claboratory on wheels,\u201d the futuristic auto included more than 50 innovations.</p><p>One of the most visible features was the clear, nonglare, heatproof plastic sliding roof panel. At the flick of a lever, the windows rolled down and the top retracted. When an electrical moisture sensor detected a hint of rain, it would automatically seal the car. Alas, the X-100 did not have air conditioning. I\u2019m a South Carolinian, and the thought of an uncooled drive on a sunny, hot August day is, let\u2019s say, unappealing. I suspect the designers, being in Detroit, hadn\u2019t thought through summer in the Deep South.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large 1950s convertible on a curved race track.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d726\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-1950s-convertible-on-a-curved-race-track.jpg?id=61951902&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In this 1953 photo, the Ford X-100\u2019s roof panel is retracted and the windows are down. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>The designers did consider certain types of weather because the windshield wipers could spray hot or cold fluid depending on the outside temperature, and the rear window had a defroster. Another feature that I\u2019m sure wowed people in colder climates were the car\u2019s heated leather seats. The front seats were also electrically adjustable in six positions, with presets for two different drivers.</p><p>The car had a 10-tube, signal-seeking radio with separate controls and speakers for front and rear passengers. The radio itself was tucked out of sight below the dashboard, but a prismatic mirror could be lowered to show the dial.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Retro car dashboard with labeled phone, electric shaver, and steering wheel features.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a65aa\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/retro-car-dashboard-with-labeled-phone-electric-shaver-and-steering-wheel-features.jpg?id=61951890&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100 had a radiophone [top], built-in electric shaver [middle], and multifunction steering wheel with a clock and variable-volume horn [bottom].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Henry Ford</small></p><p>Bluetooth pairing obviously wasn\u2019t available in 1953, but the Ford X-100 did have a radiophone mounted in the center console, through which you could place calls via the Bell System\u2019s Mobile Telephone Service. It also had a dictaphone to record all those great ideas you\u2019d have while driving around with the wind in your hair. One innovation that didn\u2019t stand the test of time was the electric shaver and pop-up mirror stowed away in the glove compartment.</p><p>Each wheel had a built-in hydraulic jack attached to the chassis to easily lift the car when you had to change a tire. (Tubeless tires weren\u2019t yet commonplace, so changing flats was something every driver had to do.) A clock was mounted in the center of the steering wheel, where you\u2019d expect the horn to be. The horn, meanwhile, could be activated by a thin circle surrounding the clock or from buttons on the arms of the steering wheel. It had two different volume settings, softer for city traffic and louder for country roads.</p><p>The transmission had an electrically operated gear selector, which most cars didn\u2019t have at the time. In addition to power steering, there was power braking that included an electric power-assisted hand brake. Electric switches on the instrument panel opened, closed, locked, and unlocked the hood and trunk. Unfortunately, though, there were no mechanical releases to open the hood and trunk if the car lost power.</p><p>The X-100 had a built-in battery charger that could be plugged into an electrical outlet to allow the various gizmos to work even if the car wasn\u2019t running. But not every feature was electrical: Housed in a black leather pouch in front of the center console was a brass pump-style fire extinguisher. Just in case of emergency.</p><h2>The Ford X-100 Was Big in Paris</h2><p>The concept car had its second debut in the summer of 1953 during Ford\u2019s 50th-anniversary celebrations. The anniversary presented a golden opportunity for Henry Ford II to redefine the company, as Douglas Brinkley writes in <a href=\"https://douglasbrinkley.com/books/wheels-for-the-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Wheels for the World</em></em></a><em><em>, </em></em>a sweeping history of Ford published by Penguin in 2003 to celebrate the company\u2019s centennial. For its 50th, Ford produced the film <a href=\"https://www.filmpreservation.org/sponsored-films/screening-room/the-american-road-1953\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The American Road</em></em></a>; an illustrated company history, <em><em>Ford at Fifty: An American Story</em></em>;<em> </em>a two-hour <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281441/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">television special</a> hosted by Edward R. Murrow and featuring Ethel Merman, Mary Martin, and Bing Crosby; and a calendar illustrated by Norman Rockwell.</p><p>As part of this celebration, the Ford X-100 made the European circuit of auto shows. It racked up nearly 10,000 km crisscrossing the continent, driving from Paris to London to Bonn to Cologne and averaging 12 miles per gallon (about 5 km per liter) of gasoline. Despite its gas gauge indicator lights, the X-100 ran out of gas in the middle of the night on its final trip to the French port of Le Havre.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a large 1950s car on a circular stage surrounded by a crowd of onlookers.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9b190\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-large-1950s-car-on-a-circular-stage-surrounded-by-a-crowd-of-onlookers.jpg?id=61951835&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Ford X-100, shown here in Paris, racked up nearly 30,000 kilometers driving to auto shows, fairs, and dealerships. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</small></p><p>The car also toured the United States, stopping at fairs and dealerships and adding another 12,000 miles (19,300 km) to the odometer. A Ford engineer always accompanied the car to demonstrate the various features and answer any questions.</p><p>The X-100 wasn\u2019t exactly the star of <em><em>Woman\u2019s World, </em></em>but the movie industry estimated that 80 million people saw its features demonstrated on screen<em><em>.</em></em> Four other Ford concept cars also appeared, including the XL-500, the XM-800, and the Ventura, as did a Detroit auto plant.</p><p>Between the movie and the auto shows, Ford estimated that more people saw the X-100 than any other concept car. The company eventually donated the X-100 to <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Henry Ford museum</a>, in Dearborn, Mich., where it went into storage.

It\u2019s not unusual now to find, say, microcontroller boards with<a href=\"https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-redboard-turbo-samd21-development-board.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> integrated Li-ion chargers</a>. Lithium-ion is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lithium-ion-batteries\" target=\"_blank\">so popular</a>, in fact, that it\u2019s easy to forget that other battery technologies exist, even when they\u2019re a better fit.</p><p>These worthy alternatives include removable rechargeable<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> nickel\u2013metal hydride</a> batteries. While NiMH cells can\u2019t be recharged as many times as lithium-ion cells can and don\u2019t offer the same power density, they\u2019re cheaper and also safer. No need to ship them in boxes emblazoned with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/first-xray-views-into-overheating-lithiumion-batteries\" target=\"_blank\">fire warning labels</a>. The fact that NiMH cells deliver lower voltages than lithium has become less of an issue as the voltage demands of integrated circuits have fallen, with 3.3-volt and 1.8-V chips rapidly displacing the ubiquitous 5-V standard of yesteryear.</p><h2>How to Make NiMH Easier to Manage</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A collection of major components\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f962f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-collection-of-major-components.png?id=61941442&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A handful of 3D-printed parts [bottom], a servo and screen [middle] and a single printed circuit board [top] are all that\u2019s needed for the Spinc charger. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>But it\u2019s also true that recharging removable batteries can be a pain: You have to load them into a charger, which typically holds no more than four batteries at a time, and take care to put them in the right way. Otherwise you get no charging at best and irreversible damage to the cell and even overheating at worst.</p><p>To ease this pain point, I created the Spinc, a DIY device that charges up to seven NiMH AA batteries at a time and automatically figures out the polarity of each cell before charging it; when finished, it drops the batteries into a hopper. You can check on the charging status via a display that doubles as a clock.</p><p>In my day job, I work on industrial vehicles as an EE in a midsize German company. But I came to this project due to a personal interest in low-power electronics and after a fruitless attempt to harvest the last dregs of power from some nonrechargeable batteries. That failure\u2014in a nutshell, my design needed a buffer battery that had to be recharged, which defeated the whole purpose of the project\u2014got me thinking about rechargeable cells.</p><p>The hardest part of creating the Spinc was a self-imposed challenge. I wanted the charger to be compact and intuitive to use. This meant spending a lot of time perfecting the mechanism that takes a battery from the top of the charger, places and holds it between two electrodes while charging, and then drops the battery out the bottom before resetting and grabbing the next cell. A lot of careful iterations later, I had a set of seven 3D-printer files to create the parts that assemble to form the case and mechanism of the Spinc. To that, you just need to add the display, servo motor, and a printed circuit board with all the remaining components, plus an<a href=\"https://www.vishay.com/docs/84274/vcnl4040.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> infrared proximity sensor</a> that detects when a battery has been inserted and is ready to be placed between the charging electrodes.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p><span>To allow the battery to be charged regardless of which way it\u2019s put into the charger, I used a classic</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-bridge\" target=\"_blank\"> H-bridge circuit</a><span>, which is normally used to let DC motors run in either direction, with a few modifications that let it work at low voltages.</span></p><p>I decided to use a dedicated integrated circuit to manage the actual charging, with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor\" target=\"_blank\"> thermistors</a> to watch out for overheating. While I could have used a microcontroller and written my own software to monitor the battery, NiMH cells have a very flat charging curve, and it\u2019s easy to overshoot the charging cycle. Using an IC saved me from a lot of testing, and also gave me the ability to use a fast-charging mode.</p><p>However, it didn\u2019t save me from some trial and error. The first charger IC I used was attractively compact at 2 by 2 millimeters. However, when I tried charging an AA battery, I discovered that the manufacturer assumed the end user would be charging two to four batteries at a time, all hooked up in series. Charging just a single battery meant the IC\u2019s linear voltage regulator had to dissipate more heat than intended, and it quickly burned the chip out. I eventually found a somewhat larger (5.15 by 4.4 mm)<a href=\"https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ds2711-ds2712.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> charger IC</a> that uses a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply\" target=\"_blank\"> switched-mode regulator</a> and could handle the job.

The RP2040 is also responsible for monitoring the proximity sensor and driving the servo that controls the internal feed mechanism, as well as responding to the Spinc\u2019s push-button controls, which let you set the clock and start charging the batteries. The entire device is powered via a USB-C socket.</p><p>Most of the electronics are surface-mounted on a PCB that has a large center cutout to allow the batteries to pass through it. I designed the PCB in<a href=\"https://www.kicad.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> KiCad</a> and had it fabricated by<a href=\"https://jlcpcb.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> JLCPCB</a>. To make it easier to fabricate the boards correctly, I didn\u2019t try to specify 90-degree angles for the corners of the center cutout. Instead, I went with rounded corners, which are easier for the cutting tooling to follow.</p><p>The result is a desktop charger that\u2019s as convenient to use as possible. A full set of PCB schematics, bill of materials, 3D printer files, and firmware files are available from the<a href=\"https://github.com/CoretechR/SPINC\" target=\"_blank\"> project page on GitHub</a>.

Most cancer deaths, for example, are caused by strain from the disease spreading throughout the body, fueled by the few tumor cells able to survive the travel to different body parts and form new growths. But biologists know relatively little about how these aggressive cells function, which hinders knowledge of cancer progression and resistance. </p><p>Oncology isn\u2019t the only field in pursuit of valuable information about single rare cells\u2014fields including developmental biology, immunology, stem cell biology, neuroscience, and infectious disease all require studying individual cells. By looking at cells one at a time rather than in bulk, researchers can uncover their genetic makeup and unique behavior, observing subtle but influential traits that would be otherwise hidden.</p><p>The key to breakthroughs in all of these fields, experts say, is clear: better single-cell sequencing technology. </p><p>To study rare cells, researchers need to separate individual cells from big clumps of human tissue, but doing so threatens the viability of the very cells they hope to analyze. Existing technologies to isolate cells often do so by sawing small pieces off of a larger tissue chunk with a scalpel or razor, potentially damaging the cells so they can no longer be studied properly. Other methods use enzymes to isolate cells, but those procedures are time consuming and can threaten useful cell characteristics. \u201cAnd for rare cell types, every little loss counts,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/susztaklab/pi.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Katalin Susztak</a>, who studies chronic kidney disease at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Hypersonic Levitation in Cell Isolation</h2><p>A new method of isolating and suspending cells, called <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00497-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hypersonic levitation and spinning</a> (HLS), relies on acoustic resonators and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/mems-at-40/\" target=\"_self\">micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)</a> technology to yield biology breakthroughs. The group from Tianjin University in China responsible for its development found that the tool is able to isolate more cells in substantially less time than traditional techniques. </p><p>HLS uses a metal probe to transmit billions of vibrations per second into a water mixture surrounding human cancer tissue in a research lab. The resulting \u201cliquid jets\u201d peel a single cancer cell away from thousands of others in the chunk of tissue, an entirely contact-free process. The cell is held in place by the liquid jets\u2014suspended in the fluid but free to spin at any degree\u2014allowing for complete visual analysis from every angle with advanced microscopy. </p><p><a href=\"https://jyxy.tju.edu.cn/cn/szdw/20131022/650.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xuexin Duan</a>, who leads the Tianjin University group, and his colleagues set out to invent a tool that would not only lessen the threat to cells during the isolation process, but speed the whole process up. They started by considering the fact that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-protein-localization\" target=\"_self\">living cells</a> are generally surrounded by water. \u201cWe asked: could we use a finely tuned physical field within the fluid itself to act as a gentle, invisible hand?\u201d Duan says.</p><p>They came up with a small, high-frequency <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes\" target=\"_self\">ultrasound</a> probe that uses three MEMS-based resonators to vibrate tissue in a water and enzyme solution. When the device is turned on, a signal generated at 2.49 gigahertz alerts a printed circuit board to send out a high-frequency voltage. Once the voltage reaches the MEMS resonators, an <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/piezoelectric-effect#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cinverse%20piezoelectric%20effect%E2%80%9D%20refers,called%20the%20%E2%80%9Celectrostrictive%20effect%E2%80%9D.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inverse piezoelectric effect</a> is triggered, yielding billions of vibrations per second that generate acoustic waves in the surrounding fluid.</p><p>A reflector beneath each resonator bounces the waves in a specific pattern, causing the water-enzyme mixture to start flowing and spinning quickly\u2014creating liquid jets powerful enough to remove a single cell from a clump of tissue, but gentle enough to do so without deterioration. Once a cell is isolated, the same acoustic mechanisms allow it to float and spin freely in the fluid.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> </p><p>While much of the design is unique, HLS is more of a refinement than a completely new device. \u201cThis levitation method has been used before for other types of work,\u201d says <a href=\"https://web.mae.ufl.edu/hfan/Dr.Fan.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Z. Hugh Fan</a>, a biomedical MEMS and microfluidics researcher at the University of Florida. He says that HLS \u201cis an improvement, not a dramatic change.\u201d Still, Fan thinks the tool shows serious potential. </p><p>The Tianjin University researchers tested their device on human renal cancer tissue samples. Using HLS, the group was able to isolate 90 percent of cells in 15 minutes, but could only do the same for 70 percent of cells in an hour using conventional methods. HLS performed so well because it helps the enzymes penetrate the tissue and break up cells \u201cwithout the need for harsh mechanical grinding or prolonged enzymatic exposure,\u201d Duan says.</p><h2>Concerns Over HLS in Single-Cell Research</h2><p>The biggest concern from University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Susztak is that HLS may pose a threat to cells sensitive to high-frequencies. \u201cEven slight perturbations matter in single-cell work,\u201d she says. \u201cWill the acoustic fields perturb the cell\u2019s biochemistry?\u201d</p><p>Duan is confident that his team\u2019s design is safe for fragile cells because they experience a controlled force, not the raw acoustic wave, he claims. \u201cThis intense force field is confined to the fluid, not the cell directly.\u201d</p><p>Outside experts have more concerns about implementation. Susztak notes that \u201cbiological labs are unforgiving\u201d so research tools must be reliable and robust, and MEMS devices in fluid tend to face drift and calibration issues. Cost and ease of access concern Fan, though he thinks that both issues could be solved by business efforts. \u201cHow mainstream it will become is really dependent on commercialization,\u201d he says. </p><p>For these reasons and others, Duan says that his team has spun HLS into a startup company\u2014Convergency Biotech\u2014with the goal to develop HLS workstations user-friendly enough for any lab. And he\u2019s optimistic about the enterprise. \u201cWe believe MEMS-based acoustic tools will become a mainstream component of the biological toolkit,\u201d he says.</p><p>Single-cell researchers show similar optimism, but in the company of caution. Susztak considers HLS \u201ca clever tool with genuine promise,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it must prove itself in the messy world of real biology.\u201d</p>"

Rondo\u2019s system converts cheap renewable electricity into heat that can be discharged on demand into industrial processes.</p><p>This differs from most next-generation energy storage strategies, which provide electricity to grids in the absence of sun or wind. Instead, Rondo\u2019s system aims to help decarbonize emissions-heavy sectors like steelmaking and cement.</p><p>The system works like a toaster crossed with a blast furnace. Electricity from solar arrays heat iron wires similar to those in a toaster oven. These warm hundreds of tonnes of refractory bricks to temperatures up to 1,500 \u00b0C. After four to six hours of charging a day, the heat can be discharged as air or steam, without combustion or emissions.</p><p>To discharge heat, a circulating air blower is turned on, pushing air up through the brick stack and heating it to over 1,000 \u00b0C before releasing it through an outlet. The heat delivery rate can be controlled by adjusting the air flow. The battery can discharge steam instead of heat by injecting water into an attached chamber that the heated air passes through before leaving the battery through the outlet.</p><p>The real challenge in thermal energy storage is not storing heat; it\u2019s being able to charge rapidly and then deliver heat continuously at the same temperature, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-o-donnell/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John O\u2019Donnell</a>, Rondo Energy\u2019s chief innovation officer. The structure of Rondo\u2019s heat battery, which O\u2019Donnell describes as \u201ca 3D checkerboard of brick and open chambers,\u201d keeps temperatures uniform and enables rapid charging. \u201cWe can turn charging circuits on and off as fast as you can turn your toaster on and off,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. \u201cSo we can be agile.\u201d</p><p>In Rondo\u2019s first project, its 100-megawatt-hour battery is supplying heat for an enhanced oil recovery facility operated by Holmes Western Oil Corp. in Kern County, California. The battery, which is about the size of a small office building, is powered by an off-grid, 20-MW solar array built for this purpose. It converts the clean electricity into heat, and then generates steam that is injected into oil wells, heating the oil so that it thins out and flows more easily, increasing production.</p><p>Holmes Western Oil previously accomplished this with a gas-fired boiler. Cutting it will save Holmes just under 13,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions annually while also lowering costs, according to Rondo. \u201cMaking steam for oil fields is the second largest portion of industrial heat in the state,\u201d says O\u2019Donnell.</p><p>Rondo\u2019s choice to deploy its first commercial-scale, emissions-reducing battery for the extraction of a fossil fuel <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/17/good-news-bad-news-as-rondo-energy-100-mwh-heat-storage-facility-goes-live/\" target=\"_blank\">stirred some controversy.</a> Critics argue that deploying clean tech to improve or prolong fossil fuel production is counter-productive.</p><h2>Thermal Batteries for Clean Industrial Heat</h2><p>Several <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/polar-night-energy-sand-battery\" target=\"_blank\">other companies</a> are developing thermal batteries with industrial heat applications. <a href=\"https://www.antora.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Antora Energy</a> makes modular <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/could-storing-electricity-in-whitehot-blocks-give-supercheap-renewables-storage\" target=\"_self\">carbon-block heat batteries</a> that can reach over 1,500 \u00b0C and are being deployed at pilot industrial sites. <a href=\"https://energy-nest.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EnergyNest</a> is doing early commercial installations of its concrete-based thermal modules, and is partnering with Siemens Energy to scale across Europe. <a href=\"https://calectra.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Calectra</a>\u2019s ultra-high-temperature systems are in the pilot phase, and <a href=\"https://www.earthen.energy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EarthEn Energy</a> launched its modular low-temperature heat batteries in July.</p><p>These companies are focused on heat because it\u2019s central to producing staples such as steel, cement, food and chemicals. Many of these manufacturing processes run continuously and maintain high temperatures for weeks or months at a time, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/pasteurization\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">72 \u00b0C for pasteurizing milk</a> to over 1,000 \u00b0C for <a href=\"https://britishsteel.co.uk/what-we-do/how-we-make-steel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">making steel</a> or cement.</p><p>The cheapest, most efficient way to produce consistent heat has long been with fossil fuels; nothing burns as slow and hot as coal or natural gas. Their energy density, reliability, and low cost have made them hard to replace. However, industrial heat accounts for <a href=\"https://www.wbcsd.org/news/industrial-heat-an-overlooked-piece-in-the-decarbonization-puzzle/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about 18 percent</a> of greenhouse gas emissions and <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/industrials-and-electronics/our-insights/tackling-heat-electrification-to-decarbonize-industry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 20 percent</a> of global energy consumption. So innovators aiming to decarbonize these industrial sectors have their work cut out for them.</p><p>But solar power is getting cheaper. In 2024, California\u2019s solar fields <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">generated</a> almost as much electricity as its gas plants. \u201cBecause of what the wind and solar industry have done, we now have intermittent grid prices that are cheaper than fuel in a lot of places in the world,\u201d says O\u2019Donnell. Some locations generate so much clean power that the grid can\u2019t absorb it all, forcing negative electricity prices<a href=\"https://emp.lbl.gov/publications/plentiful-electricity-turns-wholesale\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> for a few hours a day.</a></p><h2>How Can Thermal Batteries Scale?</h2><p>Thermal batteries supplying heat face several challenges. In order for them to scale, industrial customers must buy renewable electricity wholesale at times of day when it\u2019s cheap, which requires dynamic real-time pricing. Many states only allow industrial customers to buy power at fixed daily rates. \u201cWe are really eager to see the regulatory framework get modernized,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says.</p><p>The price of natural gas plays a role, too. It\u2019s relatively inexpensive in the United States thanks to shale gas from fracking, but if its price increases due to exports or other factors, batteries like Rondo\u2019s could become a cheaper source of heat. This is already the case in European countries such as Germany, where the <a href=\"https://www.ceicdata.com/en/germany/natural-gas-price-household-consumers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">price of natural gas</a> has skyrocketed in the last three and a half years.</p><p>Plus, heat batteries could be difficult to integrate into existing industrial infrastructure. Not every facility has space for a battery the size of an office building and a dedicated solar array. The batteries\u2019 high up-front costs and the fact that they\u2019re still a largely unproven technology will make some would-be customers reluctant to give them a try.</p><p>Nonetheless, heat batteries like Rondo\u2019s are a promising solution for decarbonizing the industrial sector. \u201cThe thermal storage market is absolutely capable of accelerating to create meaningful impact,\u201d says Blaine Collison, executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.renewablethermal.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Renewable Thermal Collaborative</a>, a coalition focused on decarbonizing thermal energy. \u201cWhen I look at some of the fundamental characteristics of the technology\u2014relatively straightforward materials, ability to off-take renewable electricity, modularity\u2014I see scale.\u201d</p><p>This article was updated on October 31, 2025.</p>"
