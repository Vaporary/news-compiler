        "summary": "T\u00fcrkiye's response to post-pandemic inflation is a cautionary tale of how political pressure for low interest rates can create macroeconomic instabilities. While central banks worldwide raised interest rates to combat inflation in 2021-2023, Turkish authorities pursued the opposite strategy: cutting real rates to deeply negative levels while implementing financial engineering tools, FX interventions, and financial repression to stabilize markets. The centerpiece was a novel FX-protected deposit scheme (KKM) that guaranteed depositors against currency depreciation, shifting exchange rate risk to the government balance sheet. We provide a detailed account of this policy experiment and develop a theoretical model focusing on how KKM functions and creates vulnerabilities. Our model reveals that pressure to keep interest rates below inflation-targeting levels can lead to an interconnected destabilizing sequence. Low rates generate inflation, current account deficits, and exchange rate depreciation. KKM provides partial stabilization by effectively raising rates for savers while maintaining low rates for borrowers. However, this creates growing contingent fiscal burdens and vulnerability to self-fulfilling currency and sovereign debt crises. This explains additional policies adopted including capital flow management, financial repression, and return to orthodox monetary policy. As central banks worldwide face renewed pressure to set lower policy rates, T\u00fcrkiye's experience illustrates the consequences."

We use a 2019 state-contingent survey of 11,000 Danish women linked to administrative data to compare pre-birth beliefs to realized outcomes. Mothers accurately anticipate their eventual return to work but underestimate the duration of the career interruption. This miscalibration stems from two belief errors\u2014about partner leave and own labor supply\u2014which interact and persist even among second-time mothers, with implications for labor supply, planning, and policy design."

In a quantitative model calibrated to the US economy featuring both cross-state migration and risk-free savings, we find that the constrained-efficient allocation features lower population but higher average consumption in less productive states than the status quo, achieving efficiency and spatial redistribution simultaneously through dynamic incentives. In response to local negative productivity shocks, the constrained-efficient allocation features more front-loaded consumption than the status quo, with systematic heterogeneity linked to the location\u2019s pre-shock fundamentals."

Based on a database of over 150 million resumes, this metric exploits the variation in how long it takes workers to attain job titles. A person\u2019s seniority is defined as the number of years it takes the median individual\u2014within the same industry and firm size category\u2014to achieve that person\u2019s job title. Seniority aligns with standard markers of success\u2014it is positively correlated with both wages and educational attainment. To demonstrate its value as a measure of career progression, we show that individuals with higher seniority levels in the public sector are more likely to transition to higher-paying positions in the private sector. When non-monetary factors influence career choice, evaluating labor market outcomes using non-wage measures, such as seniority, offers significant advantages."

Using individual-level administrative data from the universe of civil domestic violence cases in Puerto Rico during the period 2014-2020, we leverage the staggered opening of SDVCs across judicial regions to examine the consequences for victims\u2019 judicial protection and offender recidivism. Access to SDVCs leads to a considerable 8 percentage points increase in the probability that judges issue a protection order and a 1.7 percentage point (15 percent) decrease in victim and offender reappearance rates within one year of the start of the case. Effects are more pronounced for cases in which parties have children in common and in which access to SDVCs is more limited. Linking the case data to administrative and survey data on judges, we show that the priorities of judges assigned to SDVCs play a prominent role in explaining these outcomes."

We first present the main cognitive mechanisms involved within a simple unifying framework. We then survey the extensive laboratory, online, and field experimental literature on the nature and behavioral implications of self-image concerns. We discuss in particular how they give rise to information and decision avoidance, motivated memory and beliefs, excuse-driven behavior, preferences for truth-telling, hypothetical bias, moral cleansing and moral licensing, collective identities, political preferences, and other forms of self-signaling or self-deception. We subsequently discuss common empirical strategies used to identify self-image concerns, as well as the threats to their validity and how to alleviate them. We conclude by outlining open questions and directions for future research on the belief-based approach to identity."

In response, female job seekers submitted 4.4 more job applications, shifted toward jobs with 5.4% lower wages, and experienced 0.9 weeks longer job search duration than male applicants. We also find that government subsidies that partially cover firms' wage costs of extended maternity leave help alleviate its adverse impact on gender disparities in hiring."

Orbital collision warnings can be unremitting. Whether the object is a defunct satellite or a stray hunk of glass from a solar panel that shattered long ago, every item circling Earth is also a potential projectile. And nearly all of this junk, traveling at least <a href=\"https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/track/leopars.htm\" target=\"_blank\">eight times as fast</a> as a <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/how-fast-is-a-bullet\" target=\"_blank\">rifle bullet</a>, can be damaging in a collision.

Looming on the horizon, too, is the threat of orbital junk overwhelming satellites\u2019 ability to dodge disaster. Each collision then creates more fragments, in a runaway cascade that turns low Earth orbit into a hazard zone.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>For satellite operators, sudden silences could be the first warning signs. Ground station crews that today coordinate elegant sequences of thruster burns will face more chaotic obstacle courses and bigger debris fields blooming across their display monitors. Communication lines and data traffic may drop from time to time, too, sowing chaos on the ground and menacing flights across the globe. And as the slow catastrophe builds, fuel reserves for satellite constellations will bleed down into the red from so many extensive orbital maneuvers. Spacecraft that\u2019ve run dry today will be the seedbed for tumbling, hypervelocity shrapnel tomorrow.</p><p>This doomsday scenario is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Kessler syndrome,</a> named after the American astrophysicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Kessler</a>, who <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19990041784/downloads/19990041784.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in 1976</a> began circulating his first notices at NASA about possible runaway orbital debris. Now, as the magnitude of the <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-space-junk-and-why-is-it-a-problem.html\" target=\"_blank\">space junk problem</a> rapidly scales up, technological responses are ramping up as well. Solutions in the offing include high-resolution orbital tracking, AI-powered constellation management, and an emerging robotic tech called \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/european-space-agency-esa-mission-news-orbital-debris-solar-storms\" target=\"_blank\">active debris removal</a>.\u201d This last item involves lofting a specialized spacecraft into orbit, armed with grippers or other satellite-wrangling tech that can target and grab orbiting stuff. The removal craft then guides the space junk through reentry and the ultimate splashdown of whatever survives reentry into the middle of the ocean.</p><p>But tech alone may not be enough for the magnitude of the task ahead. The debris problem could simply be growing too fast. International treaties and government regulations may be needed to classify orbits as <a href=\"https://www.wfw.com/articles/spectrum-rights-and-orbital-positions-what-do-space-operators-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">globally managed resources, like radio spectrum</a>. Because as Kessler himself has pointed out, space <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/027311779190543S\" target=\"_blank\">is complicated</a>\u2014sometimes <a href=\"https://newspaceeconomy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-kessler-syndrome-2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">frustratingly so</a>.</p><h2>What Is the Kessler Syndrome?</h2><p>In the early days, those frustrations were related to simply getting the space community to realize the problem that lay ahead. Back in the early 1970s, when <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vleo\" target=\"_blank\">low Earth orbit</a> was all but pristine, Kessler was a midcareer NASA scientist, having already notched important contributions to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab\" target=\"_blank\">Skylab</a> programs. As his colleague, the late NASA administrator <a href=\"https://aquarid.physics.uwo.ca/kessler/Burt%20Cour_Palais.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Burton Cour-Palais</a>, noted in a 2004 <a href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/Cour-PalaisBG/Cour-PalaisBG_3-1-04.htm\" target=\"_blank\">oral history</a>, Kessler \u201cwas bringing up this orbital debris thing, and the higher-ups did not want to know about it at all.\u201d</p><p>Cour-Palais also recalled being told to urge Kessler to \u201ccome up with solutions rather than problems.\u201d Fortunately, neither took the overly cautious route.</p><p>In June 1978, the <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21562202\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em></em></a><em> </em>published a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JA083iA06p02637\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> by Kessler and Cour-Palais in which they argued that a rapidly growing belt of defunct satellites, collision fragments, and other detritus could \u201cbe a significant problem during the next century.\u201d It\u2019s a prediction that has come to pass. In April of this year, Kessler and <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wzjd6/professor-hugh-lewis\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Lewis</a>, professor of astronautics at the <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Birmingham</a>, in England, presented their <a href=\"https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/sdc9/paper/305/SDC9-paper305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">latest models</a>, concluding that space junk orbiting between 400 and 1,000 kilometers\u2014where most low Earth satellites operate\u2014is already unstable. And between 520 and 1,000 km, the researchers found, debris concentrations are at or near levels that might sustain runaway growth.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25069014/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p>A recent internal report shared with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em><em>, </em></em>written by analysts at the Menlo Park, Calif.\u2013based <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, has divided the problem into what it calls \u201cfour waves of the Kessler syndrome.\u201d The first three waves, it says, may have already begun. They are: nontrackable stuff like tiny steel fragments and glass splinters colliding with non-operational trackable objects; nontrackable stuff impacting functioning satellites and causing malfunctions; and trackable objects hitting other trackable objects and creating a clouds of fragments. The fourth wave, in which two large pieces of debris incite a chain reaction of other collisions, has yet to occur. In LeoLabs\u2019 observations and models, satellites and operational spacecraft including the International Space Station, and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_space_station\" target=\"_blank\">Tiangong</a> space station continue to face manageable levels of collision avoidance maneuvers\u2014for now.</p><p>\u201cIt is assumed these operational satellites will avoid catastrophic collisions with trackable objects,\u201d the report concludes.</p><p>But according to <a href=\"https://www.swfsummit.org/luc-piguet\" target=\"_blank\">Luc Piguet</a>, CEO and cofounder of the Lausanne, Switzerland\u2013based startup <a href=\"https://clearspace.today/\" target=\"_blank\">ClearSpace</a>, challenges for operational satellites are real and mounting. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is a slow, crawling effect\u2014that when it starts accelerating, it\u2019s already too late,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is happening.\u201d</p><p>The problem can be further segmented into specific problematic orbits, according to <a href=\"https://aiaa.org/people/darren-mcknight/\" target=\"_blank\">Darren McKnight</a>, senior technical fellow at <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, which performs high-resolution debris tracking for private clients and government agencies.</p><p>\u201cThere are certain altitudes where we\u2019ve already passed the threshold for the Kessler syndrome,\u201d McKnight says. For instance, at 775 km altitude, as well as at 840 km and 975 km, the collision risk is scaling up rapidly. (See graph, \u201cLow Earth Orbit\u2019s Most High-Risk Places.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cWe will hit a point where particular popular orbits are so risky to operate in that the benefits of operating there are outweighed by the cost and risk,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.daniellerwood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danielle Wood</a>, head of <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Media Lab</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-enabled/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Space Enabled Research Group</a>.</p><h2>Why Is the Kessler Syndrome Complicated?</h2><p><a href=\"https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">According to the European Space Agency</a>, 14.5 million kilograms of man-made stuff circles the planet today. Compare that to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230930201159/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">11 million</a> kg two years ago and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200818221915/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">8.9 million</a> kg in 2020\u2014a 63 percent increase over the past five years.</p><p>McKnight says the Kessler problem comes into sharper focus when dividing mass in any given orbit by the volume of space that orbit occupies. The <em><em>mass density </em></em>in orbit, also known as the mass per cubic kilometer, provides a clue not only to the chance of orbital collisions but also to those collisions\u2019 consequences. Two small orbiting items colliding won\u2019t create nearly as much new debris as will two big ones. The more densely packed an orbit is, in other words, the more treacherous it is to keep a satellite at that orbit. \u201cMass per cubic kilometer is debris-generating potential,\u201d McKnight says, which would be a great thing to know with confidence in all the different regions of low Earth orbit.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Solar panel with three impact holes and visible damage on each section.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ff39b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/solar-panel-with-three-impact-holes-and-visible-damage-on-each-section.png?id=61618553&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 2002, Space Shuttle astronauts retrieved these solar panels from the Hubble Space Telescope\u2014revealing how destructive even small projectiles are when traveling at low Earth orbit speeds.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ESA </small></p><p>However, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kcourtneybis/\" target=\"_blank\">Katherine Courtney</a>, chair of the <a href=\"https://gnosisnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Network on Sustainability in Space</a>, knowing where all orbiting stuff is today has become a tall order. \u201cA substantial portion of smaller space junk can only be extrapolated using data collected from returned spacecraft and historical records. The vast majority can\u2019t be tracked from the ground,\u201d Courtney adds.</p><p>Moreover, says <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/jonathan-mcdowell\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan McDowell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mcdowell-19b0997/\" target=\"_blank\">astrophysicist and space historian</a> at the Harvard & Smithsonian <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Astrophysics</a>, in Cambridge, Mass., once stuff in orbit goes missing, further complications emerge. Collisions between the missing matter and other debris can completely knock the collisions\u2019 by-products into different orbits.</p><p>\u201cThe operating satellites are in nice circular orbits,\u201d McDowell says, \u201cwhereas the collision debris is crossing many orbits and affecting many more.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s now needed as the problem grows larger is a complete rethink, says <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/jah\" target=\"_blank\">Moriba Jah</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics</a> at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to the Kessler syndrome,\u201d Jah says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cascading collisions can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s that the framework oversimplifies the problem and doesn\u2019t give us a way to manage or evolve the system.\u201d</p><p>Consider instead, Jah says, a parameter he calls \u201corbital carrying capacity.\u201d \u201cIf we start from the end, we can say that carrying capacity is consumed when our ability to make decisions to avert harm no longer work,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo to me, that doesn\u2019t necessarily look like you\u2019re bumping into stuff. It also looks like you\u2019re spending fuel moving around stuff so much that you can\u2019t do the things that you wanted to do to begin with.\u201d</p><h2>How to Avoid Satellite Collisions</h2><p>As SpaceX proved 144,404 times from December 2024 through May of this year, the Starlink constellation\u2019s capacity to maneuver its hardware around space junk is impressive.</p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink</a> is a brilliant constellation,\u201d McKnight says. \u201cThey\u2019re like a granny driving on the highway. They pump their brakes. They avoid everything.\u201d</p><p>However, Starlink\u2019s own public record also showcases how rapidly the collision hazards in orbit are evolving. The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://universemagazine.com/en/starlink-satellites-performed-26-thousand-avoidance-maneuvers/\" target=\"_blank\">publicly disclosed data</a> reveals a 22-fold increase since 2020 in the amount of ducking and dodging the constellation has needed to perform to avoid collisions with other stuff in orbit.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s ducking and dodging these days, too.</p><p>\u201cCollision avoidance is a standard practice now for every operator,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Flohrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Flohrer</a>, head of the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris\" target=\"_blank\">Space Debris Office</a>.</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep your operations making sense, communicating with everybody else,\u201d says <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/person/marlon-sorge\" target=\"_blank\">Marlon Sorge</a>, technical fellow at the Chantilly, Va.\u2013based <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace Corp.</a>, \u201cand not making more of the stuff that you can\u2019t communicate with.\u201d</p><p>Yet, space junk isn\u2019t the only class of noncommunicative stuff up there. \u201cMore than half of the unidentified objects are Chinese satellites,\u201d says Courtney of the Global Network on Sustainability in Space. \u201cSo they\u2019re active satellites, but they\u2019re just not registered as identifiable objects.\u201d</p><p>The tracked debris, the untrackable tiny debris, the bigger things that are also incommunicado\u2014all of it combines to make for an increasingly massive headache.</p><p>\u201cEvery collision-avoidance maneuver is a nuisance,\u201d Holger Krag, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-krag-72895324/\" target=\"_blank\">head of ESA\u2019s Space Safety office</a>, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/AI-autonomous-space-debris-avoidance-esa\" target=\"_blank\">has said.</a> \u201cNot only because of fuel consumption but also because of the preparation that goes into it. We have to book ground-station passes, which costs money. Sometimes we even have to switch off the acquisition of scientific data. We have to have an expert team available round the clock.\u201d</p><p>So who or what, then, could possibly keep up with the rapidly scaling nature of the Kessler problem? Artificial intelligence is the almost unanimous answer.</p><p>Many of the world\u2019s major players in low Earth orbit, including <a href=\"https://content.neuraspace.com/product-launch\" target=\"_blank\">small satellite startups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation/Artificial_intelligence_in_space\" target=\"_blank\">big national space programs</a>, are currently testing and developing AI constellation-management systems.

Some <a href=\"https://flypix.ai/blog/space-debris-mapping/\" target=\"_blank\">companies</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2506.02614v4\" target=\"_blank\">research teams</a> are also developing AI tools to go beyond just keeping pace with the problem, using AI to optimize fuel usage and maintain ideal satellite configurations for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15574\" target=\"_blank\">low battery usage and simplified signal traffic</a> as well.</p><p>However, for all its smarts, AI still can\u2019t make the most difficult orbital hazards go away.

You have the same amount of real estate, but you can put more objects in there more safely when you have better visibility and situational awareness of where everything is. It\u2019s the same in space.\u201d</p><h2>What Are the Solutions to the Kessler Problem?</h2><p>Space tech and space tech alone may one day resolve the Kessler syndrome.</p><p>But as a complement to the technological innovation, international space agreements and law are also being reconsidered, because much of the existing space law standards were agreed on decades ago, during an entirely different era in low Earth orbit.</p><p>For instance, between the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty\" target=\"_blank\">Outer Space Treaty of 1967</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Liability_Convention\" target=\"_blank\">1972 Space Liability Convention,</a> even an untraceable fragment of metal in space is effectively owned by the nation that launched it. This arguably means that that nation may need to give permission for anyone else to remove the fragment from orbit.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no national borders up there,\u201d says Faiola. \u201cBut every object that is cataloged is also owned by someone, a state.

From a young age, she loved science\u2014particularly chemistry\u2014and thrived in schools designated for advanced learners.</p><p>Her first exposure to the health care field came during high school, when she trained as a nursing technician. Her high school curriculum was organized as a co-op program, which included traditional classes alternating with internships in nursing. Ramirez interned at the <a href=\"https://www.medicina.uanl.mx/hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez</a> in Monterrey, Mexico.</p><p>Alternating between the academic and vocational tracks allowed her to graduate with a diploma and a technical degree at the same time. Speaking of her early experiences, she says, \u201cI saw how many patients struggled, not just with their conditions but also with the logistics of seeking and coordinating treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat made me want to work at the intersection of medicine and innovation.\u201d</p><p>With her father working as a materials engineer and her mother as an accountant, she grew up in a household where technical problem-solving and analytical thinking were part of daily life.</p><p>That blend of influences reinforced her decision to pursue engineering as a career rather than the medical field, she says.</p><h2>Exploring neuroengineering and AI</h2><p>Since beginning her studies at UANL in 2021, Ramirez has focused on neuroengineering, one of three specializations the school offers. She has explored the role artificial intelligence plays in diagnosing and treating conditions including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alzheimers-disease\" target=\"_self\"> Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\"> </a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression\" target=\"_self\">depression</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\">, epilepsy</a>, and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/schizophrenia\" target=\"_self\"> schizophrenia</a>.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_self\">IEEE mentoring program</a>, she received guidance from global experts including a doctor from India who helped refine her early AI projects.</p><p>Her work quickly evolved from class assignments to projects with real-world potential.</p><p>\u201cThe project I\u2019m most excited about has not been published, but it mainly consisted of using convolutional neural networks in medical image processing (MRI) and machine learning in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases,\u201d she says.</p><p>This year she broadened her scope by attending the IEEE<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Conference on Robotics and Automation</a> in Atlanta, where she gained exposure to both industrial and academic applications of robotics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick. I want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Currently she is an intern at <a href=\"https://www.aunainvestors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Auna</a>, a health care network in Latin America. She contributes to improving the patient experience in hospitals across Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.</p><p>\u201cI design projects aimed at improving the quality of care and making the hospital intervention more effective for patients across different stages: prevention/wellness, diagnosis, hospitalization, rehabilitation, and post-discharge follow-up,\u201d She declined to provide specific examples, citing medical confidentiality agreements.</p><p>\u201cMy internship is about finding ways to make health care not just effective but also more humane,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about improving processes so patients feel cared for\u2014from the moment they enter the hospital until they leave.\u201d</p><h2>Finding leadership and purpose in IEEE</h2><p>Ramirez founded the IEEE EMBS student branch in 2023. As chair, she represents the branch at <a href=\"https://r9.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Region 9</a> meetings, where she advocates for mentorship opportunities and collaboration with other IEEE groups.</p><p>Through her involvement, she says, she has gained not only technical knowledge but also critical soft skills in leadership, time management, and teamwork.</p><p>\u201cIEEE taught me how to lead with empathy and how to work with people from different backgrounds,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has expanded my vision beyond Mexico, showing me challenges and innovations happening all over the world.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree abroad\u2014potentially in public health or AI for medical devices\u2014and ultimately a Ph.D. Her long-term goal is to launch a business focused on developing health care innovations, specifically in disease prevention.</p><h2>A future built on innovation</h2><p>For Ramirez, improving health care means more than developing cutting-edge technology. It also involves rethinking how people understand and manage their own health.</p><p>\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Her vision is as ambitious as it is personal, rooted in her own journey from Zacatecas to Monterrey and beyond.</p><p>As her career advances, she says, she intends to keep IEEE at the center of her professional life.</p><p>\u201cIn IEEE I\u2019ve found a community that challenges me to grow, supports me when I fail, and celebrates when I succeed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about engineering; it\u2019s about building a better future, together.\u201d</p>"

Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.<br /></p><p>Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July. Leathers uses his <span>28</span>-foot (8.5-meter) boat for cultivating oysters at <a href=\"https://maineoceanfarms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maine Ocean Farms</a>, where roughly <span>3</span> million of the animals grow in dozens of floating cages.</p><p>Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine\u2019s <span>3</span>,<span>500</span> miles (5,633 kilometers) of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor. For Leathers, whose <span>10</span>-acre (4-hectare) sea farm is a significant presence in the cove where he operates, the swap is about being a good neighbor to the shoreside community.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>It\u2019s an innovation born from necessity for us,\u201d said Strater about his electric boat, which he docks each night at the <a href=\"https://www.seameadow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sea Meadow Marine Foundation</a>, the nonprofit boatyard and aquaculture innovation hub he runs with several other small business owners. \u201c[The boat] really works well for what we do with it, and we\u2019re letting farmers use it to see how it could work for them.\u201d</p><h2>The Rise of Electric Boats</h2><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-boats\" target=\"_blank\">Battery-powered vessels</a> are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/the-first-all-electric-tugboat-in-the-us-is-about-to-launch\" target=\"_blank\">tugboats</a>, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.</p><p>In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world\u2019s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>Everyone\u2019s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we\u2019ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,\u201d said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. ferries</a>. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two men stand outside the cockpit of an electric boat named Heron that sits on the water.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e15a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-men-stand-outside-the-cockpit-of-an-electric-boat-named-heron-that-sits-on-the-water.jpg?id=61664831&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Maine Ocean Farms founders Eric Oransky [left] and Willy Leathers switched to an electric workboat in July 2025.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.bullockweddings.com/index/G0000YGZ6gDoqSck\" target=\"_blank\">Brendan Bullock</a></small></p><p><span>Electrification has only very recently come to the U.S. aquaculture sector. In Maine, the small but fast-growing segment includes nearly </span><a href=\"https://maineaqua.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>200</span> farms</a><span> for shellfish, fin fish, and edible seaweed. Strater and Leathers are among the first in their business to trade gas motors for electric propulsion\u2014a switch they say they\u2019re hoping to accelerate. Oil-guzzling motors are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar seafood sector.</span></p><p>Still, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-container-ships-are-stuck-on-the-horizon\" target=\"_blank\">electrifying commercial watercraft can be a difficult course to navigate</a>, given the higher up-front costs of electric motors and the lack of charging infrastructure\u2014and grid infrastructure in general\u2014in rural waterfront communities.</p><p>Early adopters like Strater and Leathers said they hope the experiences gained from their demonstrations can help pave the way for decarbonizing Maine\u2019s blue economy. With the help of the <a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Island Institute</a>, a Maine-based nonprofit that works on marine-related energy transitions, Leathers is collecting performance data from his vessel to share more broadly with the industry.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>People say it looks cool and shiny and looks like it operates great,\u201d Lia Morris, the Island Institute\u2019s senior community development officer, said of electric boats. <span>\u201c</span>But we really want to be able to prove out the [business] case.\u201d <span>Electric boats can cost between </span><span>20 percent</span><span> and </span><span>30 percent</span><span> more than a gas- or diesel-powered vessel of a comparable size. However, owners can save on maintenance and fuel over the long term, Strater\u2019s business partner Nick Planson said.</span><br /></p><p><span>\u201c</span>The high-level math that we\u2019ve come up with\u201d is a financial break-even point of <span>\u201c</span>about four to five years, and then over a <span>10</span>-year time span, you\u2019re definitely coming out way ahead based on the vastly reduced maintenance cost, replacement cost of failed equipment, and fuel costs,\u201d said Planson.</p><h2>Battery-Powered Workboats Lack Charging Infrastructure</h2><p>But the initial price tag presents a significant hurdle. Strater and Planson\u2019s sleekly designed, no-frills watercraft cost US $<span>100</span>,<span>000</span> to build and outfit with a single electric outboard motor. Leathers\u2019s boat, called Heron, cost about four times as much. It has two electric outboards and a ramp for unloading and hauling more than <span>10</span>,<span>000</span> oysters at a time from the sea farm to distributors waiting on the dock. Its hull is also equipped with a small cabin and toilet.</p><p>Both operations relied on grant funding to defray the expense of going electric.</p><p>For their part, Strater and Planson used about $<span>50</span>,<span>000</span> from a larger U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/1031783-an-electric-workboat-for-the-aquaculture-industry.html\" target=\"_blank\">small business grant</a> they got in <span>2024</span> to establish a use case for electric workboats in the aquaculture industry. Leathers\u2019s business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $<span>500</span>,<span>000</span> U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) <a href=\"https://www.aquaculturenorthamerica.com/maine-ocean-farms-adopts-electric-workboats-for-oyster-farming/#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20able%20to%20bring%20this,of%20Energy%2C%20Office%20of%20Energy%20Efficiency%20and\" target=\"_blank\">grant</a> last year that earmarked about $<span>289</span>,<span>000</span> for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.</p><p>The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.</p><p>The <span>DOE</span>\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it\u2019s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d says Strater.</p><p>But federal grants aren\u2019t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises, Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a <span>\u201c</span>marine green\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ceimaine.org/financing/small-business-loans/#marine-green-loans\" target=\"_blank\">loan program</a> that can make the up-front costs of switching to electric propulsion more accessible to small businesses.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,\u201d said Nick Branchina, director of <span>CEI</span>\u2019s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, <span>CEI</span> offers loans starting at $<span>25</span>,<span>000</span> for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.</p><p><span>Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to </span><span>\u201c</span><span>take a reasonable swing\u201d at electric propulsion.</span></p><p>Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.</p><h2>How Do Electric Boats Perform in Cold Weather?</h2><p><span></span><span>This summer, Leathers said he\u2019s had no trouble making the nearly 2-mile (3-kilometer) round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he\u2019s not sure how far the outboards\u2019 two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor\u2019s range. It\u2019s a part of Leathers\u2019s demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.</span></p><p>Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they\u2019re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of <span>2024</span>. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, <a href=\"https://www.shredelectric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shred Electric</a>, a boat\u2019s ability to run through the year\u2019s coldest months is a key selling point.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Planson. <span>\u201c</span>When you\u2019re working with\u2026waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.\u201d</p><p>Strater and Planson said their boat\u2019s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations 7 miles (11 kilometers) away. In the <span>10</span> months since the boat\u2019s launch, Strater has learned that range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat\u2019s pace depending on how far he wants to go.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d he said.</p><p><span></span><span>Soon, Maine\u2019s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level </span><span>2</span><span> charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over 2 hours, or three times as fast as the current system. The startup </span><a href=\"https://www.aqua-superpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua SuperPower</a><span> was awarded a portion of the </span><span>DOE</span><span> funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.</span></p><p>Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said Morris, of the Island Institute. As the state\u2019s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.</p><p>Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a <span>\u201c</span>chicken and egg\u201d problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there\u2019s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.</p><p>This challenge is compounded by both New England\u2019s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region\u2019s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it\u2019s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route <span>1</span>.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>There are a lot of complicated questions,\u201d Morris said. <span>\u201c</span>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to Maine, it\u2019s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.\u201d</p><p>Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm\u2019s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.</p><p><span></span><span>\u201c</span><span>As a whole industry, I think it\u2019s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,\u201d Leathers said. </span><span>\u201c</span><span>And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.\u201d</span> </p>"

In collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE History Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/globalmuseum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Global Museum</a> and the support of generous donors, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/chip-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_self\">Chip Hall of Fame</a> has been adapted into a traveling exhibit that has just begun making its way around U.S. museums, and, hopefully, the world.</p><p>Our Chip Hall of Fame celebrates microchips that have had a significant impact. Six of the chips from the hall were chosen to be part of the \u201cChips That Shook The World\u201d exhibit, along with artifacts embodying how each was used. One of the chosen was the 8-bit <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6502-microprocessor/\" target=\"_self\">6502</a> processor, so naturally we thought a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/commodore-64\" target=\"_self\">Commodore 64</a> home computer, which used a 6502 variant, should be one of the artifacts. Which led to another thought: Why not have the C64 run a program demonstrating an 8-bit CPU in action?</p><p>That\u2019s how I ended up, 35 years after I last programmed a C64, sitting at my office desk creating a brand-new plug-in cartridge.</p><p>The C64 supported <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Cartridge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plug-in cartridges</a> as a way of distributing software, and our demo program needed to be put on one. Each morning, the museum curator can just turn on the exhibit and presto! The demo program instantly begins running. The alternatives would have required the curator to type in commands to load the demo manually.</p><p>But this convenience comes with two big caveats: One, the demo has to fit into just 16 kilobytes, the maximum size of a cartridge. Even by the standards of the 1980s, this is small, as some C64 titles spanned <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Newcomer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of kilobytes</a> by loading data in chunks from disk or tape. Two, the demo would have to be written in <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-6502-assembly-and-low-level-programming-7c11fa6b9cb9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6502 assembly</a> and control the C64 video hardware directly.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"The components required to make a Commodore 64 cartridge.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"95d88\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-components-required-to-make-a-commodore-64-cartridge.png?id=61614662&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cartridges require only a few components: a printed circuit board [bottom right], programmable memory chip [bottom middle], and some resistors, diodes, and a capacitor [top middle]. They are mounted in a 3D-printed shell [top left and right]. To make the video output compatible with modern screens, we used a RetroTink-2X Pro adapter [bottom left].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Fortunately, from attending <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/theyre-alive-vintage-computer-fans-keep-the-great-machines-of-the-past-running\" target=\"_self\">Vintage Computer Federation events</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6ZCubprsSO/\" target=\"_blank\"> over the years</a>, I knew there were a lot of free or inexpensive resources that would make it easier than ever before to do this sort of thing.</p><p>The first step was to figure out just how much I could do in 16 KB. The C64\u2019s graphics hardware was groundbreaking in its day, capable of displaying images of up to 320 by 200 pixels with a palette of 16 colors. It could also display eight sprites at once; each sprite is a moveable single-color 24-by-21 pixel bitmap. The price for this power was complexity. The <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/VIC\" target=\"_blank\">video chip\u2019s control registers</a>, screen bitmaps, text-screen data, default and custom character sets, sprites, and color information all live in different locations scattered across memory, with some data actually living in <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color_RAM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">separate RAM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Character_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ROM</a> chips.</p><p>So I sat down with the detailed <a href=\"https://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">memory maps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Graphics_Modes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video hardware programming guides</a> available for the C64. (This abundance of information is in stark contrast to the 1980s, when documentation was scant, even from Commodore itself). I worked out that I could cram in nine screens of explanatory text, animated graphics, and sprites. Creating these screens, including the custom character sets and sprites they rely on, was greatly simplified thanks to the online C64 graphics editor at <a href=\"https://petscii.krissz.hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">petscii.krissz.hu</a>. The editor can output some results as stand-alone assembly programs, which I adapted as subroutines in my demo code.</p><p>I had just enough space remaining for a lucky find. I wanted to display at least one full-screen bitmapped image, but a prerendered image would have required 8 KB of data, half the cartridge\u2019s capacity. Instead I decided to use a classic hack of programmers since the days of games like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Rogue</em></em></a><em> </em>and<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Elite</em></em></a>: pulling free data out of the structure of mathematics by way of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">procedural generation</a>.</p><p>Here\u2019s where I got lucky: I came across the work of Marcello M., who had published the source for a C64 <a href=\"https://retro64.altervista.org/blog/the-mandelbrot-set-c64-assembly-program-to-draw-it-fast-using-integer-math-part-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assembly program</a> that quickly created a multicolor fractal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mandelbrot set</a> using just 3.3 KB of code. With Marcello\u2019s blessing, I incorporated his code as another subroutine.</p><h2>Modern Tools For Writing C64 Software</h2><p>The coding was done using the free <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ide65xx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IDE 65xx</a> and <a href=\"https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kick Assembler</a> desktop software. I was able to test the code using the popular C64 <a href=\"https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vice emulator</a>, which allowed me to do handy things like examining live memory contents to find runtime bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A diagram showing 64 kilobytes of RAM with a Kernal ROM occupying the top 8 KB, followed by 4 KB of character ROM, and then 8 KB of Basic ROM.

Finally a third column shows a 16 KB cartridge ROM overlapping the Basic ROM and the memory below it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"71b5d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-64-kilobytes-of-ram-with-a-kernal-rom-occupying-the-top-8-kb-followed-by-4-kb-of-character-rom-and-then-8-kb.png?id=61613059&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Regions of the Commodore 64\u2019s RAM were mapped to things like the system ROMs, video-color memory, and the bitmaps of characters, the latter of which were actually mapped to multiple locations in RAM when accessed by the video hardware. Some of these mappings overlapped: Inserting a 16-KB cartridge automatically disabled the ROM storing the Basic interpreter. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p><span>The next step was to make a physical cartridge. Again, there\u2019s modern help, this time in the form of US $5 printed circuit boards that need just a handful of components soldered in to make a cartridge. These components include a programmable ROM chip that I picked up for </span><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/363498306025\" target=\"_blank\">$3 on eBay</a><span>. I burned my code to the memory chip with my trusty </span><a href=\"http://autoelectric.cn/EN/TL866_main.html\" target=\"_blank\">TL866 programmer</a><span> and mounted it to the PCB, which in turn was mounted into a </span><a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:692797\" target=\"_blank\">3D-printed cartridge case</a><span>.</span></p><p>Then came the moment of truth. It probably won\u2019t come as a surprise to regular readers that I already own an original C64, which I connect to modern flat-screen displays via a <a href=\"https://www.retrotink.com/shop/retrotink-2x-pro\" target=\"_blank\">RetroTink-2X Pro</a> adapter. So I carefully pushed the cartridge into its slot and turned the machine on.</p><p>Naturally, my C64 immediately froze up. I had forgotten to remove a little bit of memory-management code that made the demo work in the Vice emulator by disabling the ROM that stores the C64\u2019s Basic interpreter. On the real hardware, this snippet ended up disabling half the cartridge\u2019s memory. A quick edit and a trip back to the TL866 and I was ready to try again. Success! I was finally literally ready to ship some software, all the way to <a href=\"https://www.uplandexhibits.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Upland Exhibits</a>, the people building our traveling display.</p><p>I hope you get a chance to see my little demo and our \u201cChips That Changed The World\u201d exhibit in person: We\u2019ll post current and upcoming locations on the Chip Hall of Fame page. But in the meantime, whether you used the C64 back in the day, or are just looking for a fun coding challenge, I recommend trying your hand at programming this 8-bit classic, now that so many of the original pain points have been reduced!</p>"

There I worked with teachers and other parents to plan and implement annual programs that enriched the students and the school community as a whole.</p><p>Through my work, I\u2019ve realized that volunteering isn\u2019t just about giving back; it\u2019s also a way to learn new skills. Every hour invested adds tangible value to one\u2019s personal and professional growth.</p><p>My experiences have shown me that membership-based organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a> that offer volunteer opportunities should position and market them as top-tier member benefits. Even if not all members volunteer their time, the availability of the opportunities and the inspiration drawn from participating can be powerful catalysts for a more vibrant and committed community.</p><p>The merits of volunteering are universally known and acknowledged. Its powerful capacity to reduce stress and boost feel-good hormones such as dopamine is widely touted, as noted in a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/onemind/2022/11/01/employer-sponsored-volunteerism-doing-good-for-business-mental-health-and-the-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Forbes</em></em> article</a> by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/onemind/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Garen Staglin</a>, the cofounder of One Mind at Work. However, the impacts of volunteering extend far beyond the typical benefits of building a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, acquiring skills, and feeling a sense of fulfillment. The deeper value lies in its ability to enhance <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/tips-on-how-to-elevate-your-career/\" target=\"_self\">professional growth and personal development</a> in less apparent ways.</p><h2>The pros of volunteering</h2><p>Here are five ways in which the \u201cwhy\u201d of purpose can fuel the \u201chow\u201d of growth:</p><ol><li><strong>Opportunities for collaboration.</strong> Volunteering provides an arena for collaboration, bringing together professionals from industry and academia, for example, in tackling shared goals. The dynamic interchange is where true growth happens. It\u2019s not just about what gets done; it\u2019s about the invaluable experience of working with diverse minds to solve problems\u2014an experience that accelerates development in all areas.</li><li><strong>Incubator for leadership.</strong> In an organization such as IEEE, where volunteers are shaping its structure and future through committees and governance bodies, the environment is ideal for developing high-impact professional skills. Volunteering instills leadership skills\u2014including strategic thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to inspire others\u2014that can be utilized in one\u2019s professional (and personal) life.</li><li><strong>Sharpening decision-making abilities.</strong> Volunteering lets you sharpen skills that are sometimes difficult to improve in the structured confines of a typical job. Working outside the usual professional hierarchy, volunteers get a chance to sharpen their critical thinking and decision-making skills with greater autonomy and a clear, mission-driven focus. A volunteering task, such as judging submissions for awards and scholarships, can hone analytical and fair-judgment skills. Planning conferences and events can help develop organizational, project management, and problem-solving abilities.</li><li><strong>Intellectual expansion</strong>. Volunteering is a fantastic way to boost your intellect and uncover hidden potential. Through collaborative problem-solving and organic knowledge-sharing, one can tackle complex issues. As you move from one task to the next, the skills can build on each other, creating a compounding effect that rapidly enhances your abilities.</li><li><strong>Staying current, relatable, and confident. </strong>A cumulative benefit of volunteering is that it can serve as a professional refresh for one\u2019s skills and perspective and can expose you to new technologies and trends outside of your field. You can learn to connect and communicate more effectively across generations and backgrounds by working alongside a diverse group of people. The collaborative environment also can provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate expertise in new ways and receive peer recognition, which in turn can reinforce your professional value and boost your confidence.</li></ol><p>Volunteering isn\u2019t just for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/celebrating-young-professionals-and-students/\" target=\"_self\">young professionals</a>; it can be a catalyst for people at every stage of their career. It can boost mid-career professionals\u2019 confidence, enabling them to hone their skills and tackle new challenges. For senior-level professionals, volunteering can expand their networks, providing fresh perspectives and collaborative opportunities outside traditional silos.</p><p>Any organization that provides volunteering opportunities is providing members or employees a valuable chance for an active investment in themselves. </p>"

Going from a five-person company to a 500-person company was daunting, especially since I had never worked in a hypergrowth organization. I talked previously about <a href=\"https://connect.ieee.org/NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGdELaJNU0IxvmlSacEixXmQHimVEcG9B5tmWq4KWGUCiUUGed4mEKL4fbUlfgQO7hUbrsGBPs=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best practices for onboarding</a>, but I want to specifically focus on an area that I sorely neglected: the skip-level one-on-one meeting.</p><p>Your \u201cskip\u201d is the person your manager reports to, often a director or vice president. It\u2019s what happens when you \u201cskip\u201d your manager up the reporting chain. Many of the ideas from a previous newsletter, <a href=\"https://connect.ieee.org/NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGdELaJNQgenK7FoHqf_C3UsOx1BGJxgIt8WQ2ZqhoTcqEohX99Wl3ZQRj3d_MksQHNOWy7fqA=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Making the Most of 1:1 Meetings With Your Boss</a>, carry over here, but skip-level 1:1 should be treated differently. The skip meeting can feel either nerve-wracking or irrelevant for many engineers, but it\u2019s actually a unique opportunity to accelerate your <span>career</span>.</p><p>Here\u2019s how you can get the most value from your skip-level meetings:</p><ul><li><strong>Understand your organization\u2019s overall strategy</strong>. Your skip manager has a broader scope and set of responsibilities compared to most people you interact with. This means they are naturally equipped to answer questions around organizational strategy. Ask them what their priorities are, and how your work contributes to the priorities they care about.</li><li><strong>Share \u201con the ground\u201d insights</strong>. No matter how hands-on they are, senior leaders are often disconnected from day-to-day work. As an individual contributor, you are well-equipped to share the experience of getting work done, both the good and the bad. This can be especially valuable if you can proactively suggest ideas to improve everyone\u2019s productivity.</li><li><strong>Be honest with feedback</strong>. A truly effective skip-level meeting requires you to be unafraid to share real problems and provide honest feedback. This is an opportunity to discuss systemic issues that your direct manager may not be able to address on their own.</li></ul><p>At Pinterest, one of the first decisions I had to make was about which team within the company I would join. Had I properly leveraged the advice from the director, I could have received valuable feedback about high-priority areas in the company. Whether you\u2019re new at a company or not, don\u2019t squander the value of building a relationship with your management chain.</p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/4-ways-conquer-imposter-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">4 Ways to Conquer Imposter Syndrome</a></h2><p>Nearly 70 percent of high-achieving adults have experienced the feelings of self-doubt that characterize imposter syndrome.

As of July 2024, its tally of genomes sequenced stood at <a href=\"https://goat.genomehubs.org/projects/EBP\" target=\"_blank\">about 4,200</a>.

Having established a genome for every eukaryotic creature, researchers will gain deep new insights into the connections among the threads in Earth\u2019s web of life, and into how evolution proceeded for its myriad life forms. That knowledge will become increasingly important as climate change alters the ecosystems on which all of those creatures, including us, depend.</p><p>And although the project is a scientific collaboration, it could spin off sizable financial windfalls. Many drugs, enzymes, catalysts, and other chemicals of incalculable value were first <a href=\"https://enviromicro-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1751-7915.13351\" target=\"_blank\">identified in natural samples</a>.

First, an organism must be found or captured and sampled, of course. That\u2019s what brought Wiesmair, Spilker, and 41 other lepidopterists to the Italian Alps for the Project Psyche expedition this past July. Over five days, they collected more than 200 new species for sequencing, which will augment the 1,000 finished lepidoptera genome sequences already completed and the roughly 2,000 samples awaiting sequencing. There\u2019s still plenty of work to be done; there are around 11,000 species of moths and butterflies across Europe and Britain.</p><p>After sampling, genetic material\u2014the creature\u2019s DNA\u2014is collected from cells and then broken up into fragments that are short enough to be read by the sequencing machines. After sequencing, the genome data is analyzed to determine where the genes are and, if possible, what they do.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Over the past 25 years, the acceleration of gene-sequencing tech has vastly outstripped any improvements in computational technology, either in memory or speed of processors.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>DNA is a molecule whose structure is the famous <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/dna/\" target=\"_blank\">double helix</a>. It resides in the nucleus of every cell in the body of every living thing. If you think of the molecule as a twisted ladder, the rungs of the ladder are formed by pairs of chemical units called bases. There are four different bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. So a \u201crung\u201d can be any of four things: A\u2013T, T\u2013A, C\u2013G, or G\u2013C.</p><p>Those four <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Base-Pair\" target=\"_blank\">base-pair</a> permutations are the symbols that comprise the code of life. Strings of them make up the genome as segments of various lengths called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/gene/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>. Your genes at least partially control most of your physical and many of your mental traits\u2014not only what color your eyes are and how tall you are but also what diseases you are susceptible to, how difficult it is for you to build muscle or lose weight, and even whether you\u2019re prone to motion sickness.</p><h2>How Long-Read Genome Sequencing Works</h2><p>Long-read sequencing starts by breaking up a sample of genetic material into pieces that are often about 20,000 base pairs long. Then the sequencing technology reads the sequence of base pairs on those DNA strands to produce random segments, called \u201creads,\u201d of DNA that are at least 10,000 pairs in length. Once those long reads are obtained, powerful bioinformatics software is used to <a href=\"https://www.cd-genomics.com/resource-genome-assembly-overview-tools.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">build longer stretches</a> of contiguous sequence by overlapping reads that share the same sequence of bases.</p><p>To understand the process, think of a genome as a novel, and each of its separate <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/chromosome/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">chromosomes</a> as a chapter in the novel. Imagine shredding the novel into pieces of paper, each about 5 square centimeters. Your job is to reassemble them into the original novel (unfortunately for you, the pages aren\u2019t numbered). What makes this task possible is overlap\u2014you shredded multiple copies of the novel, and the pieces overlap, making it easier to see where one leaves off and another begins.</p><p>Making it much harder, however, are the many sections of the book filled with repetitive nonsense: the same word repeated hundreds or even thousands of times. At least half of a typical mammalian genome consists of these repetitive sequences, some of which have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/noncodingdna/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulatory functions</a> and others regarded as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/noncodingdna/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cjunk\u201d DNA</a> that\u2019s descended from ancient genes or viral infections and no longer functional. Long-read technology is adept at handling these repetitive sequences. Going back to the novel-shredding analogy, imagine trying to reassemble the book after it was shredded into pieces only 1 centimeter square rather than 5. That\u2019s analogous to the challenge that researchers formerly faced trying to assemble million-base-pair DNA sequences using older,<a href=\"https://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk/genotes/knowledge-hub/short-read-sequencing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> \u201cshort-read\u201d sequencing technology</a>.</p><h2>The Two Approaches to Long-Read Sequencing</h2><p>The long-read sequencing market has two leading companies\u2014<a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oxford Nanopore Technologies</a> (ONT) and <a href=\"https://www.pacb.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Biosciences of California</a> (PacBio)\u2014which compete intensely. The two companies have developed utterly different systems.</p><p>The heart of <a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/platform/technology\" target=\"_blank\">ONT\u2019s system</a> is a flow cell that contains 2,000 or more extremely tiny apertures called, appropriately enough, nanopores. The nanopores are anchored in an electrically resistant membrane, which is integrated onto a sensor chip. In operation, each end of a segment of DNA is attached to a molecule called an adapter that contains a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicase\" target=\"_blank\">helicase enzyme</a>. A voltage is applied across the nanopore to create an electric field, and the field captures the DNA with the attached adapter. The helicase begins to unzip the double-stranded DNA, with one of the DNA strands passing through the nanopore, base by base, and the other released into the medium.</p><h3>OPTICAL SEQUENCING (Pacific Biosciences)</h3><br /><img alt=\"DNA sequencing process with fluorescent nucleotides on a chip and intensity readouts.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8728a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/dna-sequencing-process-with-fluorescent-nucleotides-on-a-chip-and-intensity-readouts.png?id=61631412&amp;width=980\" /><p>A polymerase enzyme replicates the DNA strand, matching and connecting each base to a specially engineered, complementary nucleotide. That nucleotide flashes light in a characteristic color that identifies which base is being connected.</p><p>Each DNA strand is immobilized at the bottom of a well.</p><p>As the DNA strand is replicated, each base while being incorporated emits a tiny flash of light in a color that is characteristic of the base. The sequence of light flashes indicates the sequence of bases.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>What propels the strand through the nanopore is that voltage\u2014it\u2019s only about 0.2 volts, but the nanopore is only 5 nanometers wide, so the electric field is several hundred thousand volts per meter. \u201cIt\u2019s like a flash of lightning going through the pore,\u201d says <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Deamer\" target=\"_blank\">David Deamer</a>, one of the inventors of the technology. \u201cAt first, we were afraid we would fry the DNA, but it turned out that the surrounding water absorbed the heat.\u201d</p><p>That kind of field strength would ordinarily propel the DNA-based molecule through the pore at speeds far too fast for analysis. But the helicase acts like a brake, causing the molecule to go through with a ratcheting motion, one base at a time, at a still-lively rate of about 400 bases per second. Meanwhile, the electric field also propels a flow of ions across the nanopore. This current flow is decreased by the presence of a base in the nanopore\u2014and, crucially, the amount of the decrease depends on which of the four bases, A, T, G, or C, is entering the pore. The result is an electrical signal that can be rapidly translated into a sequence of bases.</p><h3>NANOPORE\nSEQUENCING\n(Oxford Nanopore)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Nanopore sequencing diagram showing DNA passing through a nanopore to read ionic current changes.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a93ae\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/nanopore-sequencing-diagram-showing-dna-passing-through-a-nanopore-to-read-ionic-current-changes.png?id=61631442&amp;width=980\" /><p>The helicase enzyme unzips and unravels the double-stranded DNA, and one strand enters the nanopore. The enzyme feeds the strand through the nanopore with a ratcheting motion, base by base.</p><p>The ionic current is reduced by a characteristic amount, depending on the base. The current signal indicates the sequence of bases.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>PacBio\u2019s machines rely on an optical rather than an electronic means of identifying the bases. <a href=\"https://www.pacb.com/technology/hifi-sequencing/how-it-works/\" target=\"_blank\">PacBio\u2019s latest process</a>, which it calls HiFi, begins by capping both ends of the DNA segment and untwisting it to create a single-stranded loop. Each loop is then placed in an infinitesimally tiny well in a microchip, which can have 25 million of those wells. Attached to each loop is a polymerase enzyme, which serves a critical function every time a cell divides. It attaches to single-stranded DNA and adds the complementary bases, making each rung of the ladder whole again. PacBio uses special versions of the four bases that have been engineered to fluoresce in a characteristic color when exposed to ultraviolet light.</p><p>A UV laser shines through the bottom of the tiny well, and a photosensor at the top detects the faint flashes of light as the polymerase goes around the DNA sample loop, base by base. The upshot is that there is a sequence of light flashes, at a rate of about three per second, that reveals the sequence of base pairs in the DNA sample.</p><p>Because the DNA sample has been converted into a loop, the whole process can be repeated, to achieve higher accuracy, by simply going around the loop another time. PacBio\u2019s flagship Revio machine typically makes five to 10 passes, achieving median accuracy rates as high as 99.9 percent, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amwenger/\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Wenger</a>, senior director of product marketing at the company.</p><h2>How Researchers Will Scale Up Long-Read Sequencing</h2><p>That kind of accuracy doesn\u2019t come cheap. <a href=\"https://www.pacb.com/revio/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Revio system</a>, which has four chips, each with 25 million wells, costs around $600,000, according to Wenger. It weighs 465 kilograms and is about the size of a large household refrigerator. PacBio says a single Revio can sequence about four entire human genomes in a 24-hour period for less than $1,000 per genome.</p><p>ONT claims accuracy above 99 percent for its flagship machine, called <a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/products/sequence/promethion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PromethION 24</a>. It costs around $300,000, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosemary-sinclair-dokos-8580475/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rosemary Sinclair Dokos</a>, chief product and marketing officer at ONT. Another advantage of the ONT PromethION system is its ability to process fragments of DNA with as many as a million base pairs. ONT also offers an entry-level system, called <a href=\"https://store.nanoporetech.com/us/minion.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MinION Mk1D</a>, for just $3,000. It\u2019s about the size of two smartphones stacked on top of each other, and it plugs into a laptop, offering researchers a setup that can easily be toted into the field.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Three people in white lab coats stand next to machines in a research laboratory.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"301a3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-people-in-white-lab-coats-stand-next-to-machines-in-a-research-laboratory.png?id=61631499&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p>Although researchers often have strong preferences, it\u2019s not uncommon for a state-of-the-art genetics laboratory to be equipped with machines from both companies. At Barcelona\u2019s Centro Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Gen\u00f3mico, for example, researchers have access to both PacBio Revio machines as well as PromethION 24 and GridION machines from ONT.</p><p>Durbin, at Cambridge University, sees lots of upside in the current situation. \u201cIt\u2019s very good to have two companies,\u201d he declares. \u201cThey\u2019re in competition with each other for the market.\u201d And that competition will undoubtedly fuel the tech advances that the EBP\u2019s backers are counting on to get the project across the finish line.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"The hands of a technician, clad in blue gloves, hold a small circuit board.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f810e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-hands-of-a-technician-clad-in-blue-gloves-hold-a-small-circuit-board.png?id=61631508&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p>PacBio\u2019s Wenger notes that the 25-million-well chips that underpin its Revio system are still being fabricated on 200-millimeter semiconductor wafers. A move to 300-mm wafers and more advanced lithographic techniques, he says, would enable them to get many more chips per wafer and put hundreds of millions of wells on each of those chips\u2014if the market demands it.</p><p>At ONT, Dokos describes similar math. A single flow cell now consists of more than 2,000 nanopores, and a state-of-the-art PromethION 24 system can have 24 flow cells (or upward of 48,000 nanopores) running in parallel. But a future system could have hundreds of thousands of nanopores, she says\u2014again, if the market demands it.</p><p>The EBP will need all of those advances, and more. EBP director Lewin notes that after seven years, the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/once-thought-fantasy-effort-sequence-dna-millions-species-gains-momentum\" target=\"_blank\">three-phase initiative</a> is wrapping up phase one and preparing for phase two. The goal for phase two is to sequence 150,000 genomes between 2026 and 2030. For phase two, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to 37,500 genomes per year,\u201d Lewin says. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re getting close to 3,000 per year.\u201d In phase two, the cost per genome sequenced will also have to decline from roughly $26,000 per genome in phase one to $6,100, according to the <a href=\"https://www.earthbiogenome.org/roadmap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EBP\u2019s official road map</a>. That $6,100 figure includes all costs\u2014not just sequencing but also sampling and the other stages needed to produce a finished genome, with all of the genes identified and assigned to chromosomes.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Greenish fluid is administered through a pipette into a port in a piece of hardware.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"9d0f6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/greenish-fluid-is-administered-through-a-pipette-into-a-port-in-a-piece-of-hardware.png?id=61631517&amp;width=980\" /><p><span>Phase three will up the ante even higher. The road map calls for more than 1.65 million genome sequences between 2030 and 2035 at a cost of $1,900 per genome. If they can pull it off, the entire project will have cost roughly $4.7 billion\u2014considerably less in real terms than what it cost to do just the human genome 22 years ago. All of the data collected\u2014the genome sequences for all named species on Earth\u2014will occupy a little over 1 exabyte (1 billion gigabytes) of digital storage.</span></p><p>It will arguably be the most valuable exabyte in all of science. \u201cWith this genomic data, we can get to one of the questions that Darwin asked a long time ago, which is, How does a species arise? What is the origin of species? That\u2019s his famous book where he never actually answered the question,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/blaxter-mark/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Blaxter</a>, who leads the Darwin Tree of Life Project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge and who also conceived and started Project Psyche. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a much, much better idea about what it is that makes a species and how species are distinct from each other.\u201d</p><p>A portion of that knowledge will come from the many moths collected on those summer nights in the Italian Alps. Lepidoptera \u201cgo back around 300 million years,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/wright-charlotte/\" target=\"_blank\">Charlotte Wright</a>, a co-leader, along with Blaxter, of Project Psyche. Analyzing the genomes of huge numbers of species will help explain why some branches of the lepidoptera have evolved far more species than others, she says.</p><p> And that kind of knowledge should eventually accumulate into answers to some of biology\u2019s most profound questions about evolution and the mechanisms by which it acts. \u201cThe amazing thing is that by doing this for all of the lepidoptera of Europe, we aren\u2019t just learning about individual cases,\u201d says Wright. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned across all of it.\u201d<span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

He replaced the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lidar-on-a-chip\" target=\"_blank\">lidar</a> sensors when they broke\u2014which was all too often, and seemingly at random\u2014and developed complex calibration methods and maintenance routines just to keep them functioning and the cars drivable.</p><p>So, when he reached the end of his rope, he invented a more robust technology\u2014what he calls the \u201cmost powerful micromachine ever made.\u201d</p><p>Aguilar and his team at startup <a href=\"https://www.omnitronsensors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Omnitron Sensors</a> developed new micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology that he claims can produce more force per unit area than any other. By supplying new levels of power to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-lidar-sensor-uses-mirrors-to-achieve-high-efficiency\" target=\"_blank\">micromirrors</a>, the technology is capable of precisely steering lidar\u2019s laser beams, even while weathering hazardous elements and the bumps and bangs of the open road. With chips under test by auto-industry customers, Omnitron is now modifying the technology to reduce the power consumed by AI data centers.</p><p>Lidar, a scanning and detection system that uses lasers to determine how far away objects are, is often adopted by self-driving cars to find obstacles and navigate. Even as the market for lidar is expected to <a href=\"https://www.emergenresearch.com/press-release/global-light-detection-and-ranging-market?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">grow by 13.6 percent annually</a>, lidar use in the automotive industry has remained relatively stagnant in recent years, Aguilar says, in part because the technology\u2019s lifespan is so short. </p><p>Vibration from bumpy roads and severe environmental conditions are the biggest reliability killers for automotive lidar, says <a href=\"https://people.ece.uw.edu/li_mo/\" target=\"_blank\">Mo Li</a>, who studies photonic systems at the University of Washington. The optical alignment within the lidar package atop self-driving cars is delicate\u2014tremors from a poor paving job could physically alter where the mirrors sit in the housing, potentially misaligning the beam and causing the system to fail. Or temperature fluctuations could cause parts to expand or contract with the same unfortunate outcome, he explains.</p><p>Aguilar wondered which part broke most often and found the culprit to be scanners, the parts responsible for angling small mirrors that direct the laser beam out of the system\u2019s housing. He wanted to make scanners that could withstand the tough conditions lidar faces, and silicon flexures stood out as a solution. These structures act like springs and allow for meticulous control of the mirrors within lidar systems without wearing out, as the standard metal springs do, Aguilar claims.</p><h2>Designing a better chip</h2><p>Aguilar hoped the new material would be the answer to the problem that plagued him, but even silicon springs didn\u2019t make lidar systems as robust as they needed to be to withstand the elements they faced.</p><p>To make lidar even stronger, the team at Omnitron aimed to design a more powerful MEMS chip by increasing the amount of force the device can apply to control the mirrors in the lidar array. And they claim to have achieved it\u2014their chip can exert 10 times more force per unit area on an actuator that positions a micromirror or other sensor component than the current industry standard, they say. That extra force allows for extremely valuable control in fine adjustment. </p><p>To reach this achievement, they had to dig deep\u2014literally. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Golden discs on a hashed surface.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"74916\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/golden-discs-on-a-hashed-surface.jpg?id=61680607&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Omnitron\u2019s micromirrors steer lidar beams and could find use in data centers.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Omnitron</small></p><p>In this MEMS device, the mirror and its actuator are etched into a single silicon wafer. On its non-mirror end, the actuator is covered with tiny, closely spaced plates that fit between trenches in the wafer, like the interlocking teeth of two combs. To move the mirror, voltage is applied, and electrostatic forces angle the mirror into a specific position by moving the plates up and down within the trenches <span>as the electric field pulls across the trench sidewalls</span>. </p><p>The force that can be used to move the mirror is limited by the ratio of depth to width of the trenches, called aspect ratio. Put simply, the deeper the trenches are, the more electrostatic force can be applied to an actuator, which  leads to a higher range of motion for the sensor. But fabricating deep, narrow trenches is a difficult endeavor. Overcoming this limiting factor was a must for Aguilar. </p><p>Aguilar says Omnitron was able to improve on the around 20:1 aspect ratio he notes is typical for MEMS (other experts say 30:1 or 40:1 is closer to average these days) , reaching up to 100:1 through experimentation and prototyping in small university foundries across the United States \u201cThat\u2019s really our core breakthrough,\u201d Aguilar says. \u201cIt was through blood, sweat, tears, and frustration that we started this company.\u201d</p><p>The startup has secured over $800 million in letters of intent from automotive partners, Aguilar says, and is two months into an 18 month plan to prove that it can produce its chips at full demand rate. </p><p>Even after verifying production capabilities, the technology will have to face \u201cvery tough\u201d safety testing for thousands of consecutive hours in realistic conditions, like vibrations, thermal cycles, and rain, before it can come to market, Li says.</p><h2>Saving power</h2><p>In the meantime, Omnitron is applying its technology to solve a different problem faced by a different industry. By 2030, AI data centers are expected to require <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai\" target=\"_blank\">around 945 terawatt hours</a> to function\u2014more than the country of Japan consumes today. The problem is \u201cthe way data moves,\u201d Aguilar says. When data is sent from one part of the data center to another, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_self\">optical signals are converted into electrical signals, rerouted, and then turned back to optical signals</a> to be sent on their way. This process, which takes place in systems called network switches, burns huge amounts of power.</p><p>Google\u2019s solution, called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10041\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo</a>, is to keep the data packets in the form of optical signals for the duration of their travels, which yields a 40 percent power savings, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-evolution-of-googles-jupiter-data-center-network\" target=\"_blank\">the company claims</a>. Apollo does so by using an array of mirrors to direct the data. Aguilar is planning to make the process even more efficient using dense arrays of Omnitron\u2019s more powerful mirrors. Doing so could quadruple the amount of data each <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_blank\">network switch</a> could route by increasing the number of channels in each switch from 126 to 441, Aguilar says.</p><p>Omnitron is still early in its data center implementation, so it\u2019s not yet clear to what degree this technology can really improve on Google\u2019s Apollo. However, following a \u201ccritical design review\u201d in mid-September, \u201cone of the world\u2019s top AI hyperscalers has requested our mirrors for their next generation switch,\u201d Aguilar says. \u201cThis is proof that Omnitron solves a problem that even the biggest AI infrastructure companies can\u2019t address in house.\u201d</p><p>And there may be even more applications to come. Omnitron has received feelers from the defense industry, space companies, and groups interested in methane detection, says Aguilar. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool seeing the people knock on our door for this because I was just focusing on lidar,\u201d he says. </p>"

That\u2019s because their discovery began as 32 million possibilities and, with the help of artificial intelligence, produced a promising candidate within 80 hours. </p><p>Now researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory <a href=\"https://www.pnnl.gov/pnnl-microsoft-collaboration\" target=\"_blank\">plan to synthesize</a> and test the novel material, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04070\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Na<span>x</span>Li<span>3\u2212x</span>YCl<span>6</span></a>,  in a battery setup. It\u2019s one of several AI-generated battery chemistries making its way to the real world.</p><p><span>Microsoft\u2019s experiment started when the researchers wanted to demonstrate how AI could tackle the needle-in-a-haystack problem of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-ion-battery\" target=\"_blank\">finding useful new materials and chemicals</a>. They decided to seek new candidates for a rechargeable battery\u2019s electrolyte, because a better electrolyte could make batteries safer while simultaneously improving performance, says </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanandrewbaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Baker</a><span>, project leader at Microsoft for </span><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Quantum Elements</a><span>, a program to accelerate chemistry and materials research through Microsoft\u2019s advanced computing and AI platforms.</span></p><p>\u201cOur goal was to take one of these AI models and show the promise of accelerating scientific discovery\u2014sifting through 32.5 million materials candidates and showing that we could do it in a matter of hours, not years,\u201d Baker says. Their model, called the M3GNet framework, accelerated simulations of molecular dynamics to evaluate properties of the materials such as atomic diffusivity.</p><p>First, the Microsoft researchers asked the model to drop new chemical elements into known crystalline structures in nature and determine which resulting molecules would be stable, a step that cut the 32 million starting candidates down to half a million. AI then screened those materials based on the necessary chemical abilities to make a battery work, which chopped the pool to just 800. From there, traditional computing and old-fashioned human expertise identified the novel material that could function within a battery and use 70 percent less lithium than the rechargeable batteries in commercial use today.</p><h2>AI\u2019s Role in Next-Gen Battery Design</h2><p>The Microsoft team isn\u2019t alone. Around the world, researchers are busy trying to develop next-generation designs to replace or improve lithium-ion batteries, which use large quantities of rare, expensive, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-tools-find-essential-battery-materials\" target=\"_blank\">difficult-to-acquire elements</a>. New battery designs could use more abundant materials, reduce the fire danger from lithium-based liquid electrolytes, and pack more energy into a smaller space. The chemistries to do this are waiting out there to be discovered, and increasingly, researchers are harnessing AI and machine learning to do the work of sorting through the mountain of data. </p><p>\u201cWe are teaching AI how to be a materials scientist,\u201d says <a href=\"https://people.njit.edu/profile/ddlab#about\" target=\"_blank\">Dibakar Datta</a>, associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, who published a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250802022915.htm\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> in August that used AI to identify five candidate materials for batteries that would outperform Li-ion. Datta\u2019s team is working on the multivalent battery: one that employs multivalent ions that can carry multiple charge levels as opposed to the single charge carried by a lithium battery. </p><p>This would give the battery a greater energy storage capacity, but it also means working with larger ions from elements higher on the periodic table, like magnesium and calcium. Those larger ions won\u2019t necessarily fit into existing battery designs without cracking or breaking the elements, Datta says. His new study used what he calls a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) that could propose new materials, and a large language model (LLM) that could find materials that would be the most stable in the real world. From a pool of millions of possibilities, the approach <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00264-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666386425002644%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\" target=\"_blank\">found five porous materials</a> of the right size that could do the job.</p><p>Guiding an AI model on its hunt through the nearly infinite space of possible materials is the tipping point in this field. The key to using it as a research partner is to find a happy medium between a model that works fast and a model that delivers perfectly accurate results, says <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/austin-sendek\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Austin Sendek</a>, professor at Stanford University who has developed algorithms to help AI discover new battery materials. </p><p>\u201cYou have to traverse both breadth and depth,\u201d says Sendek. Depth, because designing these things takes a lot of deep scientific knowledge about properties, engineering and chemistry, and breadth, because you have to apply that knowledge across an infinite chemical space, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s where the promise of AI comes in.\u201d </p><h2>AI Battery Technology Search at IBM</h2><p>Researchers at IBM have taken an AI-driven approach to identify <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01774-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new electrolyte candidates</a>, which involved identifying chemical formulations with far higher ionic conductivity than the lithium salts used in current batteries. A typical electrolyte can contain six to eight ingredients including salts, solvents, and additives, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to consider all the combinations without AI. </p><p>To whittle down the field, the IBM team developed chemical foundation models trained on billions of molecules. \u201cThey capture the basic language of chemistry,\u201d says <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/people/young-hye-na\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Young-Hye Na</a>, Principal Research Staff Member at IBM Research. Her team then trains those models with battery-related data so the AI can predict important properties for battery applications on scales from individual molecules all the way up to a whole device. Na described the work in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01774-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a paper published in August in NPJ Computational Materials</a>.</p><p>Because the work investigates new combinations of existing materials rather than using AI to invent exotic new materials, its potential to help build the battery of tomorrow is that much more promising, Na says. The IBM team is now collaborating with an undisclosed EV manufacturer to design high-performance electrolytes for high-voltage batteries.</p><p>IBM\u2019s use of AI for batteries isn\u2019t limited to the hunt for promising materials. Typically, when AI reveals a promising new material, the next step is for experimentalists to synthesize the stuff, experiment with it in the lab, and one day to test it in a real device. Machine learning (ML) will aid researchers in this testing step, too. </p><p>IBM is testing the real-world viability of new battery setups by <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/revolutionizing-industries-with-ai-powered-digital-twins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">building their digital twins</a>\u2014virtual models that allow the researchers to predict how a particular battery chemistry would degrade over a lifetime of countless power cycles. The model, developed in collaboration with battery startup <a href=\"https://www.sphere-energy.eu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sphere Energy</a>, can predict a battery\u2019s long-term behavior in as few as 50 power cycles modeled on the digital twin, says <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/people/teodoro-laino\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Teodoro Laino</a>, distinguished research staff member at IBM Research.</p><h2>Quantum Computing Batteries</h2><p>The next phase of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-air-battery-quantum-computing\" target=\"_blank\">AI battery research is quantum</a>. As Microsoft and IBM push toward the potential of quantum computers, both see its promise to model complex chemistry with no shortcuts or compromises. Na says that while current AI is a crucial tool for investigating battery chemistry, the next step\u2014modeling whole EV battery packs, for example, and taking into consideration all the variables they encounter in the real world\u2014would require the power of quantum computing. </p><p>As Baker puts it: \u201cWe know classical computers have problems generating accurate answers for complex substances, complex molecules, complex materials. So our goal right now is actually to change the way the data is generated by bringing quantum into the loop so that we have higher accuracy data for training ML models.\u201d</p><p><em>This article was updated on October 2, 2025.</em></p>"
