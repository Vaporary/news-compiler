In a model with realistic risk premia, nominal rigidities, and an intermediary sector, calibrated to the U.S., we estimate this threshold at 189%. We highlight the roles of safety premia and intermediation-driven convenience yields. The threshold varies with the source of surpluses: spending cuts reduce inflation and allow low interest rates, while tax increases distort labor supply and raise inflation. Uncertainty over the austerity regime\u2014spending cuts or tax increases\u2014sharply lowers fiscal capacity. The expected austerity regime affects asset prices and macro outcomes even when debt-to-GDP is well below the threshold."

We recover human-comparable treatment effects in a multi-wave randomized controlled trial of inflation expectations surveys, at 1/1000 the cost. To demonstrate the framework\u2019s full potential, we extend the benchmark human survey (10 waves, 2018\u20132023) to over 50 waves dating back to 1990. We further examine the economic mechanisms underlying agents\u2019 expectation formation, identifying the mean-reversion and individual-attention channels. Finally, we trace dynamic treatment effects and demonstrate clean identification. Together, these innovations demonstrate that LLM surveys enable research designs unattainable with human surveys."

Leveraging nearly 75 years of economist survey data on real GDP growth expectations, we identify economic states while sidestepping model-driven forecast error. GDP forecasts comove with consumption and predict the market return, real GDP growth, and consumption growth. This approach builds on the literatures on both the Intertemporal and Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Models. We document a statistically significant, economically meaningful procyclicality premium that remains robust to standard factor controls."

        "summary": "This paper simulates economic developments as if the discretionary fiscal stimulus enacted in the past two recessions had not occurred and additional automatic fiscal stabilizers had been deployed instead. For the calibration of key economic relationships most consistent with the empirical literature, we find that more sustained fiscal stimulus would have pushed unemployment down more rapidly following the Great Recession and that more limited stimulus would have caused inflation to increase much less following the COVID recession. We caution, though, that our estimates are uncertain given the large number of assumptions embedded in the calculations. Under different assumptions about the supply side of the economy when resource utilization is high, the stimulus enacted in early 2021 was not a significant cause of the observed runup in inflation that followed, and substituting an automatic stabilizer would have made little difference to inflation."

She helms the annual <a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Teardown hardware conference</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-leigh-5804558/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Helen Leigh</a> is the director of business development at <a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Crowd Supply</a>. A division of <a href=\"https://www.mouser.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mouser Electronics</a>, Crowd Supply is a crowdfunding site for small hardware manufacturers making novel products. Leigh spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> about what makes a crowdsourcing project successful, and how Crowd Supply is trying to help.</p><p><strong>What are some of the biggest mistakes applicants make?</strong></p><p><strong>Helen Leigh</strong>: Here\u2019s a big one: setting your price too low. Engineers tend to focus just on the product and the cost of the bill of materials, right? But logistics is expensive. Putting your product on a shelf, taking it off, putting it in a box, putting a label on it, all of that.</p><p>Another one is when people say they\u2019ve made something for <em><em>X</em></em> market, but they\u2019ve never spoken to a single person in their target market. We advise people to throw themselves to the wolves of Reddit and social media.</p><p><strong>How does Crowd Supply help applicants?</strong></p><p><strong>Leigh</strong>: We help with all the nonengineering parts of bringing a product to market, including financial spreadsheets, fulfillment guidance, and product photography. If a campaign is successful, we typically place a house order for at least as many as were sold in their campaign, paid in advance. But what\u2019s become very important in the last few months is navigating compliance. <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/know-your-incoterms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Incoterms</a> are really important now.</p><p><strong>What are Incoterms?</strong></p><p><strong>Leigh</strong>: Say you were manufacturing some watches in China and shipping them to our warehouse in Texas. What happens if the boat goes down? Who bears that risk?</p><p>In the past, the term we mostly used was DDP: delivered duty paid. That\u2019s where a creator is paying all the taxes and tariffs, getting everything to our warehouse free and clear, and we take it from there.</p><p>But in that scenario a tariff comes in and suddenly you, as an indie creator, are having to pay much more. You\u2019re probably losing money now, which could destroy you as a creator, right? One way we take on the burden of risk is by offering <a href=\"https://www.aitworldwide.com/resources/incoterms/incoterms-fca-free-carrier/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FCA [free carrier] Incoterms</a>, which basically means we pick it up from your place of assembly and it becomes our responsibility, including freight and the tariffs.</p><p><strong>What impacts are you seeing from tariffs?</strong></p><p><strong>Leigh:</strong> Delays, of course, but tariffs haven\u2019t stopped people from making stuff. I really do believe we\u2019re in a golden age for indie developers. We have more choice than ever, plus technical education and documentation has never been better or more accessible, thanks to companies like Adafruit and Raspberry Pi.</p><p>One silver lining of tariffs is that designers are now forced to take into consideration the entire supply chain, which ultimately does make their designs better.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s your favorite Crowd Supply success story?</strong></p><p><strong>Leigh</strong>: The most obvious one would be<a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/slimevr/slimevr-full-body-tracker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> SlimeVR</a>. They do trackers that go on your body for virtual reality. They raised US $7.6 million, so they are very financially successful, but the way they have managed their community is what inspires me. They have openly talked about how vital community contributions have been to their software stack. It\u2019s a nice example of what can come from opening your hardware.</p><p><em>This article appears in the November print issue as \u201cHelen Leigh.\u201d</em><br /></p>"

These Global Sounding Balloons (GSBs), as we call them, can maneuver through the atmosphere and follow dynamic flight paths by surfing the winds. In the lead-up to Milton, we <a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/how-windborne-navigated-first-ever-balloon-deployed-dropsondes-directly-into-hurricane-milton\" target=\"_blank\">launched six of these balloons</a>, carrying dropsondes, from a safe distance away, in Mobile, Ala. Within the next 24 hours, the balloons were able to enter the hurricane and release their dropsondes to measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, along with wind speed and direction\u2014information that potentially could have helped forecasters determine exactly how the hurricane would behave.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A close-up shows a small black device in a plastic bag.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"51a2b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-close-up-shows-a-small-black-device-in-a-plastic-bag.jpg?id=61772142&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The sensors that collect weather data for each Global Sounding Balloon are encased in plastic.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Christie Hemm Klok </small></p><p>This dropsonde deployment, the first ever by weather balloon, demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to release airborne sensors without the usual costs and risks to human life. And when our team ran the collected data through our AI-based forecasting model, WeatherMesh, its predictions of Milton\u2019s path were more accurate than those from the <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. National Hurricane Center</a>. Alas, because our dropsonde launch was an experiment meant to test our technology\u2019s capabilities, the results we obtained couldn\u2019t be disseminated to the public in real time. But it was nevertheless a great accomplishment: WindBorne proved definitively that AI forecasts can outperform the kind of weather models our society has relied on for decades.</p><p>Our mission at WindBorne is to build what we liken to a \u201cplanetary nervous system\u201d\u2014an end-to-end AI-based forecasting system that can gather vast amounts of weather data and transform that data into accurate and timely forecasts. Just as a person\u2019s nervous system constantly sends information from all parts of the body to the brain, our planetary nervous system gathers observations from all over the Earth and sends them to our AI brain.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Our system, which requires both advanced data-collection hardware and sophisticated AI modeling, can radically improve how people use weather predictions to make decisions in areas such as national defense, renewable energy, and agriculture.

Most weather balloons burst after just a couple of hours in flight, collecting data for only a single up-down cycle as they ascend, pop, and then drop back down to the ground. These balloons almost never go far beyond their continental launch sites, leaving the air above oceans, deserts, and other remote regions underobserved. That\u2019s problematic because weather is global: A disturbance that starts near the west coast of Africa can develop into the next catastrophic storm to hit North America.</p><p>While working on the project, we discovered that the flight limitations of conventional weather balloons mean that they\u2019re observing only about 15 percent of the globe. We realized that if we improved the hardware and control systems, we could create weather balloons that self-navigate and intelligently \u201csurf\u201d the wind, allowing them to stay aloft much longer than conventional balloons\u2014think weeks instead of hours.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A young man in a black t-shirt stands in front of a large machine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a4dbc\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-man-in-a-black-t-shirt-stands-in-front-of-a-large-machine.jpg?id=61772455&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">John Dean cofounded WindBorne in 2019.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Jason Henry/The New York Times/Redux        </small></p><p>I cofounded the company in 2019 with four of my peers from Stanford, and later took on the role of CEO. At that time, we were still in the early R&amp;D stages for our balloons. The result of that work was a design for autonomous, long-duration balloons that communicate with operators via satellite. In 2024, we introduced our first AI forecasting model, WeatherMesh, to ingest the data from the balloons and give them high-level instructions on where to fly next to fill in specific data gaps.</p><p>The main envelope of a WindBorne balloon is made from a thin, transparent film just 20 micrometers thick\u2014less than half the thickness of a human hair\u2014and the whole assembly weighs less than 2 kilograms. Each balloon has a bag of sand used as ballast; the balloon can release sand to rise higher or vent gas to descend to a different wind current. Each balloon\u2019s onboard autonomous system plots how to use the winds at different elevations to reach the locations specified by its WeatherMesh instructions.</p><p>Our GSBs, which collect orders of magnitude more data than single-use dropsondes, make up <a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/products/observations\" target=\"_blank\">Atlas</a>, our global constellation. Today, our GSBs can fly for well over 50 days at altitudes ranging from ground level up to around 24 kilometers. Atlas, which typically has hundreds of balloons in the air at any time, collects more in situ data each day than the balloons managed by the U.S. National Weather Service.</p><p>Following our time at Stanford, the WindBorne team built a business by scaling our Atlas constellation and providing weather data as a service. At first, the balloons\u2019 navigation was guided by results from a traditional numerical weather-prediction model that ran on a supercomputer. But running that model required hundreds of times as much computing power as AI weather models do. As our constellation proved capable of collecting vast amounts of data, we knew we needed to build a model that could not only efficiently direct our balloon constellation but also assimilate its massive datasets.</p><h2>The Limitations of Traditional Forecast Methods</h2><p>Currently, most weather forecasts rely on physics-based <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/numerical-weather-prediction\" target=\"_blank\">numerical weather prediction</a>. In the United States, this job is handled by the federal government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast\" target=\"_blank\">Global Forecast System</a> (GFS), which ingests data from satellites, ground stations, radar systems, and a worldwide network of conventional weather balloons. It runs on a supercomputer four times a day, using a technique called data assimilation to produce forecasts that extend up to 16 days out. Data assimilation interprets new data alongside historical data to come up with the most accurate forecast possible.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man stands on a beach next to a large metal apparatus mounted on a tripod.

With much of the global atmosphere not being regularly probed by balloons, current forecasts are hamstrung by the sparseness of the datasets available to them. You\u2019ve probably seen a hurricane\u2019s forecast cone shift dramatically from one day to the next. That volatility comes in part from the incomplete data driving these models. What\u2019s more, physics-based models require enormous computing resources, which translate into high operational costs.</p><p>Over the last few years, AI models have disrupted weather forecasting, proving that they can generate faster, less costly, and more accurate predictions when compared with the prior gold standard of physics-based numerical weather models. When the Chinese company Huawei introduced its <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3\" target=\"_blank\">Pangu-Weather</a> model in 2023, it served notice that AI forecasting could not only compete with physics-based models, but it could even outperform them. Other recent AI weather models include Google DeepMind\u2019s <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/\" target=\"_blank\">GraphCast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ecmwf.int/en/newsletter/178/news/aifs-new-ecmwf-forecasting-system\" target=\"_blank\">AIFS</a> from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. But our system <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/14/2024/windborne-takes-the-ai-weather-prediction-crown\" target=\"_blank\">outperforms</a> all of them, sometimes by a very large measure.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man observing a clear plastic balloon attached to a tripod on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"44883\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-observing-a-clear-plastic-balloon-attached-to-a-tripod-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780018&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Person launches a clear balloon with tripod apparatus on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"51f93\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-launches-a-clear-balloon-with-tripod-apparatus-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780015&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man with a clear plastic balloon standing on a beach on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4fe4a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-with-a-clear-plastic-balloon-standing-on-a-beach-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780012&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man launches a clear plastic balloon on a foggy beach.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5c703\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-launches-a-clear-plastic-balloon-on-a-foggy-beach.jpg?id=61780011&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A screenshot showing the balloon's location and its sensor readings. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fd56b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-showing-the-balloon-s-location-and-its-sensor-readings.jpg?id=61780009&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The balloon is initially doubled up [top] to make it more maneuverable before launch.

For starters, all AI models are trained on historical weather data and predictions produced by conventional systems. Without them, the model would have to rely on raw, real-time observations for training data, without historical context.</p><p>AI models also inherently lack an advanced understanding of physics, so traditional models provide a baseline to ensure that AI-generated predictions are physically plausible. This assistance is especially important during extreme weather events, when physics-based models can help AI models simulate rare conditions based on atmospheric principles.</p><h2>How We Built our AI Weather-Forecasting Model</h2><p>When the WindBorne team set out to build the initial version of WeatherMesh, we had three main goals. First, it had to be inexpensive to run. Second, it needed to be at least as accurate as the top physics-based models. Third, it had to deliver forecasts with a high spatial resolution, providing fine-grained predictions on the scale of tens of kilometers.</p><p>We decided to use an architecture based on what are called transformers\u2014the same technology that powers large language models like ChatGPT\u2014because transformers can process huge datasets efficiently once they\u2019re trained. This architecture includes what AI mavens refer to as an encoder-processor-decoder structure. The encoder transforms raw weather data\u2014things like temperature, wind, and pressure\u2014into a simpler compressed format known as latent space, where patterns are easier for the model to work with. The processor then runs calculations in this latent space to predict how the weather will change over time. To create longer-range forecasts, we simply run the processor step multiple times, with the output of the last prediction step serving as the input for the next. Finally, the decoder translates the results back into real-world weather variables.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A photo from a manufacturing facility shows dozens of long plastic bags hanging from hooks.

Setting up our own machines paid off. The hardware set us back about $100,000, but had we run all our training experiments in the cloud instead, it easily would have cost four times as much.</p><p>The first version of WeatherMesh was smaller, faster, and cheaper to operate than the AI weather models created by tech giants. During training, it used about one-fifteenth the computing power of DeepMind\u2019s GraphCast and one-tenth that of Huawei\u2019s Pangu-Weather. Its small size makes its stellar performance all the more notable: It outperformed both those AI models and traditional physics-based models.</p><p>The early accuracy gains of WeatherMesh can be attributed to our data-collection method. Our GSBs collect 30 to 50 times as much data as do conventional balloons, and we feed that data directly into WeatherMesh. We measured our model\u2019s accuracy based on frequency of errors when compared with other physics- and AI-based models. In 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/02/14/2024/windborne-takes-the-ai-weather-prediction-crown\" target=\"_blank\">beat</a> both Huawei\u2019s Pangu-Weather and DeepMind\u2019s GraphCast to become the most accurate AI forecasting model in the world. At the time this article is being published, in October 2025, WeatherMesh retains the lead.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A close-up shows a woman assembling electronic components.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e99a7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-close-up-shows-a-woman-assembling-electronic-components.jpg?id=61886030&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Each balloon has an antenna that enables it to communicate via satellite. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Christie Hemm Klok </small></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man sitting at a table uses a tool to assemble electronic components.

Today, WeatherMesh also includes a component that can provide forecasts for selected locations at a resolution of about 1 km.</p><p>Most AI weather models train on historical datasets like ERA5, which organizes decades of atmospheric data into a consistent framework. But we also wanted WeatherMesh to run \u201clive,\u201d ingesting real-time balloon observations and up-to-date analyses from the U.S. and European agencies. That transition was challenging, because most AI models perform worse when they shift from carefully curated historical data to messy real-world feeds.</p><p>To address this issue, we built specialized adapters based on a type of neural-network architecture known as U-Net, which excels at learning spatial features across different scales. These adapters translate real-time data into the same internal format used for WeatherMesh\u2019s training data. In this way we preserved the benefits of training on ERA5 while still delivering accurate real-time forecasts.</p><h2>Building On Success With WeatherMesh-4</h2><p><span>Following the success of our initial WeatherMesh model, we released the </span><a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/windborne-breaks-new-ai-forecasting-records-with-weathermesh-2-model-surpassing-ai-and-physics-gold-standards\" target=\"_blank\">second</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/weathermesh-3-fast-and-accurate-operational-global-weather-forecasting\" target=\"_blank\">third</a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/weathermesh-4-technical-blog\" target=\"_blank\">fourth</a><span> versions of the model in rapid succession. WeatherMesh-4 predicts standard atmospheric variables at 25 vertical levels throughout the atmosphere. It also predicts a wide range of conditions at the surface, including temperature and dewpoint at 2 meters from the ground, wind speed at 10 meters and 100 meters, minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, solar radiation, and total cloud cover. It can produce a full forecast every 10 minutes based on the latest observations. In contrast, traditional global weather models update every 6 hours.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man stands by a large machine, over which is stretched a thin sheet of translucent plastic.

We\u2019ve found that the model\u2019s predictions for the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere are up to <a href=\"https://windbornesystems.com/blog/weathermesh-4-technical-blog\" target=\"_blank\">30 percent more accurate</a> than those from a traditional model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and also surpass results from DeepMind\u2019s latest model, <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gencast-predicts-weather-and-the-risks-of-extreme-conditions-with-sota-accuracy/\" target=\"_blank\">GenCast</a>, on most evaluations.</p><p>Building an end-to-end system means the entire pipeline must work in harmony. Our balloon constellation can\u2019t afford to wait 12 hours for a new forecast; it needs near-constant refreshes to navigate the skies. Meanwhile, the AI model uses fresh atmospheric data from the balloons to improve the accuracy of its forecasts. Balancing these requirements forced us to get creative about how we moved the data and ran the model, but ultimately we produced a powerful system that\u2019s fast and responsive.</p><h2>What\u2019s Next for WindBorne</h2><p>In the coming years, our goal is to expand our Atlas balloon constellation to about 10,000 GSBs flying at any time, launched from about 30 sites worldwide. To achieve that goal we\u2019ll need roughly 300 launches per day, or 9,000 per month. By 2028, we believe the entire globe could be under near-continuous observation by Atlas, from the remote Pacific to the polar ice caps. And we continue to test the boundaries of what is possible: WindBorne recently kept a balloon aloft for a record-breaking 104 days.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man standing in a field holds a big round white balloon over his head.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"246f5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-standing-in-a-field-holds-a-big-round-white-balloon-over-his-head.jpg?id=61772459&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Traditional weather balloons stay aloft for only a few hours and don\u2019t go far from their launch sites.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Annie Mulligan/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images        </small> </p><p>We\u2019re not aiming to make physics-based weather models obsolete. We see a future where AI and traditional methods operate side by side, each reinforcing the other. Governments, researchers, and corporations can lean on these improved forecasts to guide disaster preparedness, aviation, supply-chain logistics, and more. Our planet\u2019s weather challenges are only going to intensify as the climate continues to change, and improved forecasts are key to helping us prepare.</p><p>Looking back at Hurricane Milton, it still feels surreal that our balloons managed to ride into a storm of that scale. Yet that was the moment WindBorne proved that a new and agile system could deliver real value where legacy methods fall short. In a world where an extra 12 or 24 hours of warning can mean the difference between safety and devastation, end-to-end AI forecasting offers a revolution in how people can observe, predict, and protect themselves from the most powerful forces on Earth. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

But the theory hasn\u2019t always matched up to reality. Real-world <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking\" target=\"_blank\">mesh networks</a> have proved vulnerable to shutdowns in some of <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/albrecht\" target=\"_blank\">the very settings</a>, such as certain kinds of large crowds, they\u2019re supposed to be good at handling.</p><p>So researchers from City College of New York, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins University have recently built a prototype mesh networking system that\u2019s been hardened for some of the most challenging and adversarial environments around: political protests.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1872\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> presented last week at the ACM <a href=\"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Conference on Computer and Communications Security</a> in Taipei, Taiwan, the researchers announced a prototype mesh network called Amigo. <span>Amigo, for starters, has been designed to work in environments where the Internet has been shut off, as seen during unrest in <a href=\"https://pulse.internetsociety.org/en/shutdowns/\" target=\"_blank\">India, Iraq, and Syria</a>, among other countries.</span></p><p>\u201cShutting down the Internet during times of great civil protest is a way to prevent people from being able to organize and come together,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/tushar-jois\" target=\"_blank\">Tushar Jois</a>, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at City College. \u201cThat is what we\u2019re specifically tailoring our technology for.\u201d</p><p>Amigo proposes at least three ways to bolster the more traditional approaches to mesh networks. <a href=\"https://martinralbrecht.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bridgefy-abridged.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recent scholarship</a> on mesh outages in protest scenarios reveals problems such as network messages failing to deliver, appearing out of order, and exposing users to being traced\u2014even if the nodes in the network (for example, phones running the mesh app) are right next to each other. The researchers found that prying beneath the mesh network\u2019s high-level, encrypted communications and down into nuts-and-bolts <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lifi-standards\" target=\"_self\">Wi-Fi</a> operations revealed opportunities that previous mesh networks had failed to seize on.</p><p>\u201cThe story is the cryptography alone won\u2019t save us,\u201d says Jois. He and colleagues presented a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5lInx9-vP8\" target=\"_blank\">version of their Amigo paper</a> earlier this year at the <a href=\"https://rwc.iacr.org/2025/program.php\" target=\"_blank\">Real World Cryptography conference</a> in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p><h3>Why Political Protests Matter in Mesh Networks</h3><p><span>Amigo</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/about-us/news/using-messaging-service-bridgefy-could-have-dire-consequences-for-users-if-privacy-protection-issues-aren-t-fixed/\" target=\"_blank\">drew key lessons from</a><span> a set of </span><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/albrecht\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a><span> on mesh networking in a range of recent political protests\u2014including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong prodemocracy actions in 2019 and \u201920</a>. </span><span></span></p><p>For example, how previous mesh networks handled routing of their messages could accidentally lead to a flooding of the zone. Multiple nodes in a stressed network can pump out redundant messages into the network, causing communications to grind to a crawl. By contrast, Amigo forms what the researchers call dynamic \u201ccliques\u201d\u2014where only designated leader nodes exchange messages with each other, while regular nodes just talk to their leader. This technique, the researchers say, substantially reduces message traffic, decreasing the chance the network might seize up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re [among] the people to discover that in secure mesh messaging, we\u2019ve had this blind spot,\u201d Jois says. \u201cSo we proposed some new algorithms that help address this blind spot. Dynamic-clique routing basically allows groups of nodes to self-organize routing units in a geographic area based on GPS.\u201d</p><p>Another example is Amigo\u2019s approach to cryptography and anonymity. Previous mesh environments provided no easy way to remove members from encrypted groups. (In a protest setting, group removal might be necessary, for instance, because a device or its user has been apprehended by authorities.) Older mesh standards also leaked metadata that could reveal other group members. <span>Amigo aims to correct both problems.</span></p><p>\u201cOne thing we talk about is outsider anonymity,\u201d Jois says. \u201cPeople who are outside your group don\u2019t know that the group exists.\u201d Amigo, he says, adds new algorithms to ensure outsider anonymity and group removal. Jois adds that Amigo aims to achieve these goals while still retaining protections of existing encrypted-message networks like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/encrypted-messaging-app\" target=\"_self\">WhatsApp and Signal</a>.</p><p>Traditionally, Jois adds, encrypted messaging provides a couple of important features. One feature involves protecting past messages: via \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy\" target=\"_blank\">forward secrecy</a>,\u201d even if keys are stolen today, past messages are still secure. The other involves protecting future messages: via \u201c<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7536374\" target=\"_blank\">post-compromise security</a>,\u201d even a compromised system can heal by generating new keys and thus locking an intruder out of future communications. Amigo retains both features.  </p><p>\u201cWe add [our new protections] to the classic forward secrecy and post-compromise security,\u201d Jois says. \u201cBut maybe there are more properties that we need from a security perspective. So I think juggling all of those will be fun.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dbarrada/\" target=\"_blank\">Diogo Baradas</a>, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Canada, adds that Amigo could find applications beyond political protests.</p><p>\u201cAnother scenario where such crowd dynamics are of particular interest include natural-disaster scenarios\u2014like flooding, fires, and earthquakes\u2014where Internet communications may become unavailable,\u201d says Baradas, who is not on the Amigo team. \u201cAnd affected citizens, first responders, and volunteers must coordinate to ensure a fitting response.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An illustration of simulated versus organic movement.

She\u2019s been investigating the \u201crandom walk\u201d\u2013style approach to modeling crowds in most mesh network environments.</p><p>Like nitrogen and oxygen molecules in a sample of air, individual mesh nodes today are typically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_waypoint_model\" target=\"_blank\">imagined to each trace random paths</a> whose motions are uncorrelated to nearby nodes. <span>If this, Ruiz says, is how mesh networks mathematically model crowd behavior, then </span><span>no wonder</span><span> </span><span>mesh networks seize up in certain real-world environments. </span></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no understanding of the way that protesters are physically moving in these mass civil protests,\u201d Ruiz says of traditional mesh models of crowd behavior. \u201cAnd without having that understanding of the way that people move and what drives the movement, what it looks like on any level, it\u2019s going to be nearly impossible to develop a really tailored solution.\u201d</p><p>So instead, Ruiz is exploring ways to bring models of what she calls psychological crowds into mesh-network algorithms. She <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEatax_cbKA&amp;list=PLlg8We3ePxcPG0FRTcEEdsViRevFjikIU&amp;index=8&amp;t=35951s\" target=\"_blank\">described this work</a> in August at the <a href=\"https://schedule.hope.net/hope16/schedule/#2025-08-16\" target=\"_blank\">Hackers on Planet Earth conference</a> in Queens, N.Y. </p><p>\u201cPsychological crowds are a concentration of people in a place that have a certain shared sense of self,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that shared sense of self can directly impact the way that people move. They tend to move closer together. They don\u2019t tolerate as much distance being put in between one another. They move slower.\u201d</p><p>Jois says developing more realistic mathematical models of psychological crowds is a cross-disciplinary effort. It\u2019s part math, and it\u2019s part sociology and group psychology. <span>\u201c[Ruiz\u2019s] current work is about determining communications dynamics and [group] dynamics by going to protest activists and journalists\u2014in these places where Internet shutdowns are common\u2014and figuring out what are their needs,\u201d he says.</span></p><p><span>\u201cSince mesh is so heavily impacted by physical movement and traffic patterns,\u201d Ruiz adds, \u201cHaving a strong understanding is key to furthering Amigo and other future mesh messaging tools.\u201d </span></p><p>Jois adds that Amigo drew as inspiration for its crowd models a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UROUN37_gUqrDd4FYDFYXQAmYuXtsBAfaDLo47Im-Kk/edit#heading=h.9n9f9eiq3xhs\" target=\"_blank\">document</a> created in 2019 by Hong Kong prodemocracy protesters, advising fellow activists how to march and gather. From that and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-585-29603-6_5\" target=\"_blank\">other studies</a> that could <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/highway-blockade-reveals-splits-in-hong-kong-protest-movement-idUSKBN1XP06R/\" target=\"_blank\">help devise mathematical models</a> of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030707/\" target=\"_blank\">real-world crowd movements</a>, Jois says Amigo represents an important next step toward bringing mesh networks into the real world.</p><p>\u201cOur results show that there is some foundational work necessary in mesh networking,\u201d Jois says. \u201cWe can stand in our academic spaces and say, \u2018Oh well, this is what we think is necessary.\u2019 But unless we get that from the source, we don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>"

We can\u2019t control who our manager is, but we can shape that relationship to better work for us.</span></p><p>Managing up is an important skill, and something I didn\u2019t even realize I could do until I was a Senior Engineer at Facebook. I could have unlocked considerably more career support and investment if I had worked better with my manager.</p><p>Here are three core ideas that made a meaningful impact on how I approach my manager relationship: </p><p>First, understand your manager\u2019s motivations. Many early-career engineers are completely clueless about how their managers are evaluated. Ultimately, your manager is assessed on the overall impact of their team. Your manager will often spend time giving feedback to reports and ensuring engineers are unblocked. But they may also need to remove people from the team or cancel projects. You need to determine what your manager cares about and how your work fits into their priorities.</p><p>Second, understand your boss\u2019s preferred communication style. Many software projects come with a README file that describes how to use them. Imagine you had to write a README file for your manager: the need-to-know information to best interact with them. This document would include their preferences and pet peeves around communication, their preferred work environments, and their strengths and weaknesses. Once you have a README file, either something you wrote on behalf of your manager or something you collaboratively put together with your manager\u2019s input, apply it to your interactions.</p><p>Finally, figure out how to work productively with your manager as you plan your tasks. Instead of asking how you can get involved in something new, bring value. Provide data, insights, or proposals that move the conversation forward, rather than simply waiting for an assignment. Also, no manager wants to deal with surprises. Ensure that you communicate ahead of any surprises, and you\u2019ve thought about next steps when things inevitably go wrong. </p><p>You can control, at least partially, your manager\u2019s investment in you. This is not about after-work drinks or political maneuvering \u2014 managing up is a critical skill for career advancement, whether we do it consciously or not. </p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">Talent Shortage Threatens Energy Sector\u2019s Future</a></h2><p>We need more power engineers.

But beneath that smooth experience, the system is quietly generating a dense digital trail of personal data.</span></p><p>That\u2019s the hidden cost of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">agentic AI</a> (systems that don\u2019t just answer questions, but perceive, plan, and act on your behalf). Every plan, prompt, and action gets logged; caches and forecasts accumulate; traces of daily routines settle into long-lived storage.</p><p>These records aren\u2019t sloppy mistakes\u2014they\u2019re the default behavior of most agentic AI systems. The good news is that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Simple engineering habits can maintain autonomy and efficiency while dramatically shrinking the data footprint.<strong></strong></p><h2>How AI Agents Collect and Store Personal Data<strong></strong></h2><p>During its first week, our hypothetical home optimizer impresses. Like many agentic systems, it uses a planner based on a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models\" target=\"_blank\">large language model</a> (LLM) to coordinate familiar devices throughout the house. It monitors electricity prices and weather data, adjusts thermostats, toggles smart plugs, tilts blinds to reduce glare and heat, and schedules EV charging. The home becomes easier to manage and more economical.</p><p>To reduce sensitive data, the system stores only pseudonymous resident profiles locally and doesn\u2019t access cameras or microphones. It updates its plan when prices or weather shift, and logs short, structured reflections to improve the next week\u2019s run.</p><p>But the home\u2019s residents have no idea how much personal data is being collected behind the scenes. Agentic AI systems generate data as a natural consequence of how they operate. And in most baseline agent configurations, that data accumulates. While not considered best practice in the industry, such a configuration is a pragmatic starting point for getting an AI agent up and running quickly.</p><p>A careful review reveals the extent of the digital trail.</p><p>By default, the optimizer keeps detailed logs of both instructions given to the AI and its actions\u2014what it did, and where and when. It relies on broad, long-term access permissions to devices and data sources, and stores information from its interactions with these external tools. Electricity prices and weather forecasts are cached, temporary in-memory computations pile up over the course of a week, and short reflections meant to fine-tune the next run can build up into long-lived behavioral profiles. Incomplete deletion processes often leave fragments behind.</p><p>On top of that, many smart devices collect their own usage data for analytics, creating copies outside of the AI system itself. The result is a sprawling digital trail, spread across local logs, cloud services, mobile apps, and monitoring tools\u2014far more than most households realize.</p><h2>Six Ways to Reduce AI Agents\u2019 Data Trails<br /></h2><p>We don\u2019t need a new design doctrine\u2014just disciplined habits that reflect how agentic systems operate in the real world.</p><p>The first practice is constraining memory to the task at hand. For the home optimizer, this means limiting working memory to a single week\u2019s run. Reflections are structured, minimal, and short-lived, so they can improve the next run without accumulating into a dossier of household routines. The AI works only within its time and task limits, and the select pieces of data that persist have clear expiration markers.</p><p>Second, deletion should be easy and thorough. Every plan, trace, cache, embedding, and log is tagged with the same run ID so that a single \u201cdelete this run\u201d command propagates through all local and cloud storage and then provides confirmation. A separate, minimal audit trail (necessary for accountability) retains only essential event metadata under its own expiration clock.</p><p>Third, access to devices should be carefully limited through temporary, task-specific permissions. A home optimizer could receive short-lived \u201ckeys\u201d for only the needed actions\u2014adjusting a thermostat, turning a plug on or off, or scheduling an EV charger. These keys expire quickly, preventing overreach and reducing the data that must be stored.</p><p>Next, the agent\u2019s actions must be visible through a readable \u201c<a href=\"https://sierra.ai/blog/agent-traces\" target=\"_blank\">agent trace</a>.\u201d This interface shows what was planned, what ran, where data flowed, and when each piece of data will be erased. Users should be able to export the trace or delete all data from a run easily, and the information should be presented in plain language.</p><p>The fifth good habit is enforcing a policy of always using the least intrusive method of data collection. So if our household optimizer, dedicated to energy efficiency and comfort, can infer occupancy from passive motion-detection or door sensors, the system must not escalate to video (for example, grabbing a security-camera snapshot). Such escalation is prohibited unless it\u2019s strictly necessary and no equally effective, less intrusive alternative exists.</p><p>Finally, mindful observability limits how the system monitors itself. The agent logs only essential identifiers, avoids storing raw sensor data, caps how much and how often information is recorded, and disables third-party analytics by default. And every piece of stored data has a clear expiration time.</p><p>Together, these practices reflect well-established <a href=\"https://www.onetrust.com/blog/gdpr-principles/\" target=\"_blank\">privacy principles</a>: purpose limitation, data minimization, access and storage limitation, and accountability.</p><h2>What a Privacy-First AI Agent Looks Like</h2><p>It\u2019s possible to preserve autonomy and functionality while dramatically shrinking the data trail.</p><p>With these six habits, the home optimizer continues to precool, shade, and charge on schedule. But the system interacts with fewer devices and data services, copies of logs and cached data are easier to track, all stored data has a clear expiration date, and the deletion process provides a user-visible confirmation. A single trace page summarizes intent, actions, destinations, and retention time for each data item.</p><p>These principles extend beyond home automation. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use\" target=\"_blank\">Fully online AI agents</a>, such as travel planners that read calendars and manage bookings, operate on the same plan-act-reflect loop, and the same habits can be applied.</p><p>Agentic systems don\u2019t need a new theory of privacy. What matters is aligning engineering practices with how these AI systems actually operate. Ultimately, we need to design AI agents that respect privacy and responsibly manage data. By thinking now about agents\u2019 digital trails, we can build systems that serve people without taking ownership of their data.</p>"

And as our machines gain more power, they\u2019re becoming not just tools but decision-makers shaping our future.</p><p>But with great power comes great\u2026heat!</p><p>As nanometer-scale transistors switch at gigahertz speeds, electrons race through circuits, losing energy as heat\u2014which you feel when your laptop or your phone toasts your fingers. As we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trillion-transistor-gpu\" target=\"_self\">crammed more and more transistors onto chips</a>, we\u2019ve lost the room to release that heat efficiently. Instead of the heat spreading out quickly across the silicon, which makes it much easier to remove, it builds up to form hot spots, which can be tens of degrees warmer than the rest of the chip. That extreme heat forces systems to throttle the performance of CPUs and GPUs to avoid degrading the chips.</p><p>In other words, what began as a quest for miniaturization has turned into a battle against thermal energy. This challenge extends across all electronics. In computing, high-performance processors demand ever-increasing power densities. (New Nvidia GPU B300 servers will consume <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-b300/\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 15 kilowatts</a> of power.) In communication, both digital and analog systems push transistors to deliver more power for stronger signals and faster data rates. In the power electronics used for energy conversion and distribution, efficiency gains are being countered by thermal constraints.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A thick sheet of gray-scale grains.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d15b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-thick-sheet-of-gray-scale-grains.png?id=61766971&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The ability to grow large-grained polycrystalline diamond at low temperature led to a new way to combat heat in transistors. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Mohamadali Malakoutian</small></p><p>Rather than allowing heat to build up, what if we could spread it out right from the start, inside the chip?\u2014diluting it like a cup of boiling water dropped into a swimming pool. Spreading out the heat would lower the temperature of the most critical devices and circuits and let the other time-tested cooling technologies work more efficiently. To do that, we\u2019d have to introduce a highly thermally conductive material inside the IC, mere nanometers from the transistors, without messing up any of their very precise and sensitive properties. Enter an unexpected material\u2014diamond.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>In some ways, diamond is ideal. It\u2019s one of the most thermally conductive materials on the planet\u2014many times more efficient than copper\u2014yet it\u2019s also electrically insulating. However, integrating it into chips is tricky: Until recently we knew how to grow it only at circuit-slagging temperatures in excess of 1,000 \u00b0C.</p><p>But my research group at Stanford University has managed what seemed impossible. We can now grow a form of diamond suitable for spreading heat, directly atop semiconductor devices at low enough temperatures that even the most delicate interconnects inside advanced chips will survive. To be clear, this isn\u2019t the kind of diamond you see in jewelry, which is a large single crystal. Our diamonds are a polycrystalline coating no more than a couple of micrometers thick.</p><p>The potential benefits could be huge. In some of our earliest gallium-nitride radio-frequency transistors, the addition of diamond dropped the device temperature by more than 50 \u00b0C. At the lower temperature, the transistors amplified X-band radio signals five times as well as before. We think our diamond will be even more important for advanced CMOS chips. Researchers predict that upcoming chipmaking technologies could make hot spots almost 10 \u00b0C hotter [see , \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_self\">Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever</a>\u201d, in this issue]. That\u2019s probably why our research is drawing intense interest from the chip industry, including Applied Materials, Samsung, and TSMC. If our work continues to succeed as it has, heat will become a far less onerous constraint in CMOS and other electronics too.</p><h2>Where Heat Begins and Ends in Chips</h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A rectangle of black fading into bright gray at the bottom.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d8b96\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-rectangle-of-black-fading-into-bright-gray-at-the-bottom.png?id=61766985&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the boundary between the diamond and the semiconductor, a thin layer of silicon carbide forms. It acts as a bridge for heat to flow into the diamond. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Mohamadali Malakoutian</small></p><p>Heat starts within transistors and the interconnects that link them, as the flow of current meets resistance. That means most of it is generated near the surface of the semiconductor substrate. From there it rises either through layers of metal and insulation or through the semiconductor itself, depending on the package architecture. The heat then encounters a thermal interface material designed to spread it out before it ultimately reaches a heat sink, a radiator, or some sort of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">liquid cooling</a>, where air or fluid carries the heat away.</p><p>The dominant cooling strategies today center around advances in heat sinks, fans, and radiators. In pursuit of even better cooling, researchers have explored liquid cooling using microfluidic channels and removing heat using phase-change materials. Some computer clusters go so far as to submerge the servers in thermally conductive, dielectric\u2014electrically insulating\u2014liquids.</p><p>These innovations are critical steps forward, but they still have limitations. Some are so expensive they\u2019re worthwhile only for the highest-performing chips; others are simply too bulky for the job. (Your smartphone can\u2019t carry a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/xmems\" target=\"_self\">conventional fan</a>.) And none are likely to be very effective as we move toward chip architectures resembling silicon skyscrapers that stack multiple layers of chips. Such <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hybrid-bonding\" target=\"_self\">3D systems</a> are only as viable as our ability to remove heat from every layer within it.</p><p>The big problem is that chip materials are poor heat conductors, so the heat becomes trapped and concentrated, causing the temperature to skyrocket within the chip. At higher temperatures, transistors leak more current, wasting power; they age more quickly, too.</p><p>Heat spreaders allow the heat to move laterally, diluting it and allowing the circuits to cool. But they\u2019re positioned far\u2014relatively, of course\u2014from where the heat is generated, and so they\u2019re of little help with these hot spots. We need a heat-spreading technology that can exist within nanometers of where the heat is generated. This is where our new low-temperature diamond could be essential.</p><h2>How to Make Diamonds</h2><p>Before my lab turned to developing diamond as a heat-spreading material, we were working on it as a semiconductor. In its single-crystal form\u2014like the kind on your finger\u2014it has a wide bandgap and ability to withstand enormous electric fields. Single-crystalline diamond also offers some of the highest thermal conductivity recorded in any material, reaching 2,200 to 2,400 watts per meter per kelvin\u2014roughly six times as conductive as copper. Polycrystalline diamond\u2014an easier to make material\u2014can approach these values when grown thick. Even in this form, it outperforms copper.</p><p>As attractive as diamond transistors might be, I was keenly aware\u2014based on my experience researching gallium nitride devices\u2014of the long road ahead. The problem is one of scale. Several companies are working to scale high-purity diamond substrates to 50, 75, and even 100 millimeters but the diamond substrates we could acquire commercially were only about 3 mm across.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A polygon with layers demarcated in it surrounded by a jagged blue area. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"38b33\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-polygon-with-layers-demarcated-in-it-surrounded-by-a-jagged-blue-area.png?id=61771341&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors were an ideal test case for diamond cooling. The devices are 3D and the critical heat-generating part, the two-dimensional electron gas, is close to the surface. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chris Philpot</small></p>So we decided instead to try growing diamond films on large silicon wafers, in the hope of moving toward commercial-scale diamond substrates. In general, this is done by reacting methane and hydrogen at high temperatures, 900 \u00b0C or more. This results in not a single crystal but a forest of narrow columns. As they grow taller, the nanocolumns coalesce into a uniform film, but by the time they form high-quality polycrystalline diamond, the film is already very thick. This thick growth adds stress to the material and often leads to cracking and other problems.<p>But what if we used this polycrystalline coating as a heat spreader for other devices? If we could get diamond to grow within nanometers of transistors, get it to spread heat both vertically and laterally, and integrate it seamlessly with the silicon, metal, and dielectric in chips, it might do the job.</p><p>There were good reasons to think it would work. Diamond is electrically insulating, and it has a relatively low dielectric constant. That means it makes a poor capacitor, so signals sent through diamond-encrusted interconnects might not degrade much. Thus diamond could act as a \u201cthermal dielectric,\u201d one that is electrically insulating but thermally conducting.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"SEM images showing surface before and after polycrystalline diamond growth on silicon oxide.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"94099\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/sem-images-showing-surface-before-and-after-polycrystalline-diamond-growth-on-silicon-oxide.png?id=61771368&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Polycrystalline diamond could help reduce temperatures inside 3D chips. Diamond thermal vias would grow inside micrometers-deep holes so heat can flow from vertically from one chip to a diamond heat spreader in another chip that\u2019s stacked atop it.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Dennis Rich</small></p><p>For our plan to work, we were going to have to learn to grow diamond differently. We knew there wasn\u2019t room to grow a thick film inside a chip. We also knew the narrow, spiky crystal pillars made in the first part of the growth process don\u2019t transmit heat laterally very well, so we\u2019d need to grow large-grained crystals from the start to get the heat moving horizontally. A third problem was that the existing diamond films didn\u2019t form a coating on the sides of devices, which would be important for inherently 3D devices. But the biggest impediment was the high temperature needed to grow the diamond film, which would damage, if not destroy, an IC\u2019s circuits. We were going to have to cut the growth temperature at least in half.</p><p>Just lowering the temperature doesn\u2019t work. (We tried: You wind up, basically, with soot, which is electrically conductive\u2014the opposite of what\u2019s needed.) We found that adding oxygen to the mix helped, because it continuously etched away carbon deposits that weren\u2019t diamond. And through <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/9/10/498\" target=\"_blank\">extensive experimentation</a>, we were able to find a formula that produced coatings of large-grained polycrystalline diamond all around devices at 400 \u00b0C, which is a survivable temperature for CMOS circuits and other devices.</p><h2>Thermal Boundary Resistance</h2><p>Although we had found a way to grow the right kind of diamond coatings, we faced another critical challenge\u2014the phonon bottleneck, also known as thermal boundary resistance (TBR). Phonons are packets of heat energy, in the way that photons are packets of electromagnetic energy. Specifically, they\u2019re a quantized version of the vibration of a crystal lattice. These phonons can pile up at the boundary between materials, resisting the flow of heat. Reducing TBR has long been a goal in thermal interface engineering, and it is often done by introducing different materials at the boundary. But semiconductors are compatible only with certain materials, limiting our choices.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A cartoon of squares stacked atop one another and connected by a forest of vertical links. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"386f9\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-cartoon-of-squares-stacked-atop-one-another-and-connected-by-a-forest-of-vertical-links.png?id=61771378&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Thermal scaffolding would link layers of heat-spreading polycrystalline diamond in one chip to those in another chip in a 3D-stacked silicon. The thermal pillars would traverse each chip\u2019s interconnects and dielectric material to move heat vertically through the stack. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Srabanti Chowdhury</small></p><p>In the end, we got lucky. While growing diamond on GaN capped with silicon nitride, we observed something unexpected: The measured TBR was <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c13833\" target=\"_blank\">much lower than prior reports led us to expect</a>. (The low TBR was independently measured, initially by <a href=\"https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-h-h-kuball\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Kuball</a> at the University of Bristol, in England, and later by <a href=\"https://me.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1618/Samuel-GrahamJr\" target=\"_blank\">Samuel Graham Jr</a>., then at Georgia Tech, who both have been coauthors and collaborators in several of our papers.)</p><p>Through further investigation of the interface science and engineering, and in collaboration with <a href=\"https://mse.utdallas.edu/ourteam/faculty/cho-k/\" target=\"_blank\">K.J. Cho</a> at the University of Texas at Dallas, we identified the cause of the lower TBR. <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413734\" target=\"_blank\">Intermixing at the interface</a> between the diamond and silicon nitride led to the formation of silicon carbide, which acted as a kind of bridge for the phonons, allowing more efficient heat transfer. Though this began as a scientific discovery, its technological impact was immediate\u2014with a silicon carbide interface, our devices exhibited significantly improved thermal performance.</p><h2>GaN HEMTs: The First Test Case</h2><p>We began testing our new low-TBR diamond coatings in gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). These devices amplify RF signals by controlling current through a two-dimensional electron gas that forms within its channel. We leveraged the pioneering research on HEMTs done by <a href=\"https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/umesh-mishra\" target=\"_blank\">Umesh Mishra</a>\u2019s laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I had been a graduate student. The Mishra lab invented a particular form of the material called N-polar gallium nitride. Their N-polar GaN HEMTs demonstrate exceptional power density at high frequencies, particularly in the W-band, the 75- to 110-gigahertz part of the microwave spectrum.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/silicon-carbide\" target=\"_self\">Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide Fight for Green Tech Domination</a></p><p>What made these HEMTs such a good test case is one defining feature of the device: The gate, which controls the flow of current through the device, is within tens of nanometers of the transistor\u2019s channel. That means that heat is generated very close to the surface of the device, and any interference our diamond coating could cause would quickly show in the device\u2019s operation.</p><p>We introduced the diamond layer so that it surrounded the HEMT completely, even on the sides. By maintaining a growth temperature below 400 \u00b0C, we hoped to preserve core device functionality. While we did see some decline in high-frequency performance, the thermal benefits were substantial\u2014<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10019509\" target=\"_blank\">channel temperatures dropped by a remarkable 70 \u00b0C</a>. This breakthrough could be a potentially transformative solution for RF systems, allowing them to operate at higher power than ever before.</p><h2>Diamond in CMOS</h2><p>We wondered if our diamond layer could also work in high-power CMOS chips. My colleagues at Stanford, <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~hspwong/\" target=\"_blank\">H.-S. Philip Wong</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/subhasish-mitra\" target=\"_blank\">Subhasish Mitra</a>, have long championed 3D-stacked chip architectures. In CMOS computing chips, 3D stacking appears to be the most viable way forward to increase integration density, improve performance, and overcome the limitations of traditional transistor scaling. It\u2019s already used in some advanced AI chips, such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-mi300\" target=\"_self\">AMD\u2019s MI300 series</a>. And it\u2019s established in the high-bandwidth memory chips that pump data through Nvidia GPUs and other AI processors. The multiple layers of silicon in these 3D stacks are mostly connected by microscopic balls of solder, or in some advanced cases just by their copper terminals. Getting signals and power out of these stacks requires vertical copper links that burrow through the silicon to reach the chip package\u2019s substrate.</p><p>In one of our discussions, Mitra pointed out that a critical issue with 3D-stacked chips is the thermal bottlenecks that form within the stack. In 3D architectures, the traditional heat sinks and other techniques used for 2D chips aren\u2019t sufficient. Extracting heat from each layer is essential.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Our research could redefine thermal management across industries.</p><p>Our experiments on thermal boundary resistance in GaN suggested a similar approach would work in silicon. And when we integrated diamond with silicon, the results were remarkable: An interlayer of silicon carbide formed, leading to diamond with an excellent thermal interface.</p><p>Our effort introduced the concept of thermal scaffolding. In that scheme, nanometers-thick layers of polycrystalline diamond would be integrated within the dielectric layers above the transistors to spread heat. These layers would then be connected by vertical heat conductors, called thermal pillars, made of copper or more diamond. These pillars would connect to another heat spreader, which in turn would link to thermal pillars on the next chip in the 3D stack, and so on until the heat reached the heat sink or other cooling device.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Temperature vs. compute tier graph; AI accelerator heats most without scaffold.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8310e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/temperature-vs-compute-tier-graph-ai-accelerator-heats-most-without-scaffold.png?id=61771384&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The more tiers of computing silicon in a 3D chip, the bigger difference thermal scaffolding makes. An AI accelerator with more than five tiers would well exceed typical temperature limits unless the scaffolding was employed. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Srabanti Chowdhury</small></p>In a collaboration with Mitra, we used simulations of heat generated by real computational workloads to operate a proof-of-concept structure. This structure consisted of dummy heaters to mimic hot spots in a two-chip stack along with diamond heat spreaders and copper thermal pillars. Using this, we <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873424\" target=\"_blank\">reduced the temperature to one-tenth</a> its value without the scaffolding.<p>There are hurdles still to overcome. In particular, we still have to figure out a way to make the top of our diamond coatings atomically flat. But, in collaboration with industry partners and researchers, we are systematically studying that problem and other scientific and technological issues. We and our partners think this research could offer a disruptive new path for thermal management and a crucial step toward sustaining high-performance computing into the future.</p><h2>Developing Diamond Thermal Solutions</h2><p>We now intend to move toward industry integration. For example, we\u2019re working with the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/threads-heat-removal\" target=\"_blank\">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Threads</a> program, which aims to use device-level thermal management to develop highly efficient and reliable X-band power amplifiers with a power density 6 to 8 times as efficient as today\u2019s devices. The program, which was conceived and initially run by <a href=\"https://forward.darpa.mil/presenters/Dr-Thomas-Kazior\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Kazior</a>, is a critical platform for validating the use of low-temperature diamond integration in GaN HEMT manufacturing. It\u2019s enabled us to collaborate closely with industry teams while protecting both our and our partners\u2019 processes. Defense applications demand exceptional reliability, and our diamond-integrated HEMTs are undergoing rigorous testing with industry partners. The early results are promising, guiding refinements in growth processes and integration techniques that we\u2019ll make with our partners over the next two years.</p><p>But our vision extends beyond GaN HEMTs to <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.35848/1882-0786/abf4f1\" target=\"_blank\">other materials</a> and particularly silicon computational chips. For the latter, we have an established collaboration with TSMC, and we\u2019re expanding on newer opportunities with Applied Materials, Micron, Samsung, and others through the <a href=\"https://systemx.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford SystemX Alliance</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.src.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Semiconductor Research Corp.</a> This is an extraordinary level of collaboration among otherwise fierce competitors. But then, heat is a universal challenge in chip manufacturing, and everyone is motivated to find the best solutions.</p><p>If successful, our research could redefine thermal management across industries. In my work on gallium nitride devices, I have seen firsthand how once-radical ideas like this transition to become industry standards, and I believe diamond-based heat extraction will follow the same trajectory, becoming a critical enabler for a generation of electronics that is no longer hindered by heat. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the November 2025 print issue as \u201cDiamond Blankets Will Chill Future Chips.\u201d</em></p>"

The problem is, you can\u2019t use them all at once. If you did, you would create hot spots\u2014high temperatures concentrated in tiny areas\u2014with power densities nearing those found at the surface of the sun. This has led to a frustrating paradox known as dark silicon, a term coined by computer architects to describe the growing portion of a chip that must be kept powered down. Up to 80 percent of the transistors on a modern chip must remain \u201cdark\u201d at any given moment to keep the chip from sizzling. We are building supercomputers on a sliver of silicon but only using a fraction of their potential. It\u2019s like building a skyscraper and being able to use only the first 10 floors.</p><p>For years, the industry has battled this thermal limit with bigger fans and more complex liquid cooling systems. But these are fundamentally Band-Aid solutions. Whether using air or liquid, they rely on pulling heat away from the chip\u2019s surface. The heat must first conduct through the silicon to the cooling plate, creating a thermal bottleneck that simply cannot be overcome at the power densities of future chips. Hot spots on today\u2019s chips produce tens of watts per square millimeter, and they pop up in various places on the chip at different times during computations. Air and liquid cooling struggle to focus their efforts at just the hot spots, when and where they appear\u2014they can only try to cool the whole thing en masse.</p><p>We at St. Paul, Minn.\u2013based startup Maxwell Labs are proposing a radical new approach: What if, instead of just moving heat, you could make it disappear? The technology, which we call photonic cooling, is capable of converting heat directly into light\u2014cooling the chip from the inside out. The energy can then be recovered and recycled back into useful electric power. With this approach, instead of cooling the whole chip uniformly, we can target hot spots as they form, with laser precision. Fundamentally, this technique could cool hot spots of thousands of watts per square millimeter, orders of magnitude better than today\u2019s chips are cooled.</p><h2>The Physics of Cooling With Light</h2><p>Lasers are usually thought of as sources of heat, and for good reason\u2014they are most commonly used for cutting materials or transferring data. But under the right circumstances, laser light can induce cooling. The secret lies in a luminescent process known as fluorescence.</p><p>Fluorescence is the phenomenon behind the familiar glow of highlighter markers, coral reefs, and white clothes under black-light illumination. These materials absorb high-energy light\u2014usually in the ultraviolet\u2014and reemit lower energy light, often in the visible spectrum. Because they absorb higher energy than they emit, the difference often results in heating up the material. However, under certain, very niche conditions, the opposite can happen: A material can absorb low-energy photons and emit higher-energy light, cooling down in the process.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A stack of squares on top of a layered cube with arrows pointing at the squares from the top. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0e294\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-stack-of-squares-on-top-of-a-layered-cube-with-arrows-pointing-at-the-squares-from-the-top.png?id=61755825&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">To cool computer chips with lasers, the team at Maxwell Labs plans to place a grid of photonic cold plates on top of the chip substrate. In their demo setup, a thermal camera detects hot spots coming from the chip. A laser then shines onto the photonic cold plate next to the hot spot, stimulating the photonic process that results in cooling. The photonic cold plate [inset] consists of a coupler that guides light in and out of the plate, the extractor where anti-Stokes fluorescence occurs, the back reflector that prevents light from entering the computer chip, and a sensor that is designed to detect hot spots.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">GygInfographics.com</small></p><p>The reemission is higher energy because it combines the energy from the incoming photons with phonons, vibrations in the crystal lattice of a material. This phenomenon is called anti-Stokes cooling, and it was first <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/377500a0\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated</a> in a solid back in 1995 when a team of scientists cooled an ytterbium-doped fluoride glass sample with laser light.</p><p>The choice of ytterbium as a dopant was not random: Anti-Stokes cooling works only under carefully engineered conditions. The absorbing material must be structured so that for nearly every absorbed photon a higher-energy photon will be emitted. Otherwise, other mechanisms will kick in, heating rather than cooling the sample. Ions of ytterbium and other such lanthanides have the right structure of electron orbitals to facilitate this process. For a narrow range of laser wavelengths shining on the material, the ions can effectively absorb the incident light and use phonons to trigger emission of higher-energy light. This reemitted, extracted thermal light needs to escape the material quickly enough to not be absorbed again, which would otherwise cause heating.</p><p>To date, lab-based approaches have <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c00116\" target=\"_blank\">achieved</a> up to 90 watts of cooling power in ytterbium-doped silica glass. As impressive as that is, to achieve the transformative effects on high-performance chips that we anticipate, we need to boost the cooling capacity by many orders of magnitude. Achieving this requires integration of the photonic cooling mechanism onto a thin-film, chip-scale photonic cold plate. Miniaturization not only enables more precise spatial targeting of hot spots due to the tightly focused beam, but is a crucial element for pushing the physics of laser cooling toward high-power and high-efficiency regimes. The thinner layer also makes it less likely that the light will get reabsorbed before escaping the film, avoiding heating. And, by engineering the materials at the scale of the wavelength of light, it allows for increased absorption of the incoming laser beam.</p><h2>Photonic Cold-Plate Technology</h2><p>In our lab, we are developing a way to harness photonic cooling to tackle the heat from today\u2019s and future CPUs and GPUs. Our photonic cold plate is designed to sense areas of increasing power density (emerging hot spots) and then couple light efficiently into a nearby region that cools the hot spots down to a target temperature.</p><p>The photonic cold plate has several components: first the coupler, which couples the incoming laser light into the other components; then, the microrefrigeration region, where the cooling actually happens; next, the back reflector, which prevents light from hitting the CPU or GPU directly; and last a sensor, which detects the hot spots as they form.</p><p>The laser shines onto the targeted area from above through the coupler: a kind of lens that focuses the incoming laser light onto a microrefrigeration region. The coupler simultaneously channels the inbound heat-carrying fluorescent light out of the chip. The microrefrigeration region, which we call the extractor, is where the real magic happens: The specially doped thin film undergoes anti-Stokes fluorescence.</p><p>To prevent the incoming laser light and fluorescent light from entering the actual chip and heating the electronics, the photonic cold plate incorporates a back reflector.</p><p>Crucially, cooling occurs only when, and where, the laser is shining onto the cold plate. By choosing where to shine the laser, we can target hot spots as they appear on the chip. The cold plate includes a thermal sensor that detects hot spots, allowing us to steer the laser toward them.</p><p>Designing this whole stack is a complex, interconnected problem with many adjustable parameters, including the exact shape of the coupler, the material and doping level of the extraction region, and the thickness and number of layers in the back reflector. To optimize the cold plate, we are deploying a multiphysics simulation model combined with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-018-0246-9\" target=\"_blank\">inverse design tools</a> that let us search the vast set of possible parameters. We are leveraging these tools in the hope of improving cooling power densities by two orders of magnitude, and we are planning larger simulations to achieve bigger improvements still.</p><p>Collaborating with our partners at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, we are building a demonstration version of photonic cooling at our lab in St. Paul. We are assembling an array of small photonic cold plates, each a square millimeter in size, tiled atop various CPUs. For demonstration purposes, we use an external thermal camera to sense the hot spots coming from the chips. When a hot spot begins to appear, a laser is directed onto the photonic cold plate tile directly atop it, extracting its heat. Our first iteration of the cold plate used ytterbium ion doping, but we are now experimenting with a variety of other dopants that we believe will achieve much higher performance.</p><p>In an upcoming integrated implementation of this demo, the photonic cold plates will consist of finer tiles\u2014about 100 by 100 micrometers. Instead of a free-space laser, light from a fiber will be routed to these tiles by an on-chip photonic network. Which tiles are activated by the laser light will depend on where and when hot spots form, as measured by the sensor.</p><p>Eventually, we hope to collaborate with CPU and GPU manufacturers to integrate the photonic cold plates within the same package as the chip itself, allowing us to get the crucial extractor layer closer to the hot spots and increase the cooling capacity of the device.</p><h2>The Laser-Cooled Chip and the Data Center </h2><p><span>To understand the impact of our photonic cooling technology on current and future data centers, we have performed an analysis of the thermodynamics of laser cooling combined with and compared to air and liquid cooling approaches. Preliminary results show that even a first-generation laser-cooling setup can dissipate twice the power of purely air and liquid cooling systems. This drastic improvement in cooling capability would allow for several key changes to chip and data-center architectures of the future.</span></p><p>First, laser cooling could eliminate the dark-silicon problem. By sufficiently removing heat from hot spots as they are forming, photonic cooling would permit simultaneous operation of more of the transistors on a chip. That would mean all the functional units on a chip could function in parallel, bringing the full force of modern transistor densities to bear.</p><p>Second, laser cooling can allow for much higher clocking frequencies than is currently possible. This cooling technique can maintain the chip\u2019s temperature below 50 \u00b0C <em><em>everywhere, </em></em>because it targets hot spots. Current-generation chips typically experience hot spots in the 90-to-120 \u00b0C range, and this is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hot-chips\" target=\"_self\">expected only to get worse</a>. The ability to overcome this bottleneck would allow for higher clocking frequencies on the same chips. This opens up the possibility of improving chip performance without directly increasing transistor densities, giving much needed headroom for Moore\u2019s Law to continue to progress.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A black box with optics and a chip on top, and a camera showing a colorful blob above it. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"82d47\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-box-with-optics-and-a-chip-on-top-and-a-camera-showing-a-colorful-blob-above-it.png?id=61756057&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The demo setup at Maxwell Labs demonstrates how current computer chips can be cooled with lasers. A photonic cold plate is placed on top of the chip. A thermal camera images the hot spots coming from the chip, and a laser is directed at the photonic cold plate directly above the hot spot.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Maxwell Labs</small></p><p>Third, this technology makes 3D integration thermally manageable. Because laser-assisted cooling pinpoints the hot spots, it can more readily remove heat from a 3D stack in a way that today\u2019s cooling tech can\u2019t. Adding a photonic cold plate to each layer in a 3D integrated stack would take care of cooling the whole stack, making 3D chip design much more straightforward.</p><p> Fourth, laser cooling is more efficient than air cooling systems. An even more tantalizing result of the removal of heat from hot spots is the ability to keep the chip at a uniform temperature and greatly reduce the overall power consumption of convective cooling systems. Our calculations show that, when combined with air cooling, reductions in overall energy consumption of more than 50 percent for current generation chips are possible, and significantly larger savings would be achieved for future chips.</p><p>What\u2019s more, laser cooling allows for recovering a much higher fraction of waste energy than is possible with air or liquid cooling. Recirculating hot liquid or air to heat nearby houses or other facilities is possible in certain locations and climates, but the recycling efficiency of these approaches is limited. With photonic cooling, the light emitted via anti-Stokes fluorescence can be recovered by re-collecting the light into fiber-optic cables and then converting it to electricity through thermophotovoltaics, leading to upwards of 60 percent energy recovery.</p><p>With this fundamentally new approach to cooling, we can rewrite the rules by which chips and data centers are designed. We believe this could be what enables the continuation of Moore\u2019s Law, as well as the power savings at the data-center level that could greenlight the intelligence explosion we\u2019re starting to see today.</p><h2>The Path to Photonic Cooling</h2><p>While our results are highly promising, several challenges remain before this technology can become a commercial reality. The materials we are currently using for our photonic cold plates meet basic requirements, but continued development of higher efficiency laser-cooling materials will improve system performance and make this an increasingly economically attractive proposition. To date, only a handful of materials have been studied and made pure enough to allow laser cooling. We believe that miniaturization of the photonic cold plate, aided by progress in optical engineering and thin-film materials processing, will have similarly transformative effects on this technology as it has for the transistor, solar cells, and lasers.</p><p> We\u2019re going to need to codesign the processors, packages, and cooling systems to maximize benefits. This will require close collaboration across the traditionally siloed semiconductor ecosystem. We are working with industry partners to try to facilitate this codesign process.</p><p>Transitioning from a lab-based setup to high-volume commercial manufacturing will require us to develop efficient processes and specialized equipment. Industry-wide adoption necessitates new standards for optical interfaces, safety protocols, and performance metrics.</p><p>Although there is much to be done, we do not see any fundamental obstacles now to the large-scale adoption of photonic cooling technology. In our current vision, we anticipate the early adoption of the technology in high-performance computing and AI training clusters before 2027, showing an order-of-magnitude improvement in performance per watt of cooling. Then, between 2028 and 2030, we hope to see mainstream data-center deployment, with an accompanied reduction in IT energy consumption of 40 percent while doubling compute capacity. Finally, after 2030 we foresee that ubiquitous deployment, from hyperscale to edge, will enable new computing paradigms limited only by algorithmic efficiency rather than thermal constraints.</p><p>For over two decades, the semiconductor industry has grappled with the looming threat of dark silicon. Photonic cooling offers not merely a solution to that challenge but a fundamental reimagining of the relationship between performance, computation, and energy. By converting waste heat directly into useful photons and ultimately back into electricity, this technology transforms thermal management from a necessary evil into a valuable resource.</p><p>The future of computing is photonic, efficient, and brilliantly cool. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the November 2025 print issue as \u201cHow to Cool Chips With Lasers.\u201d</em></p>"

Today she is a professor of electrical engineering at <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamia Millia Islamia University</a> in New Delhi, where she formerly was a dean.</p><h3>Mini Thomas</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Jamia Millia Islamia, in New Delhi</p><p><strong>Title: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Professor of electrical engineering</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong></p><p>Senior member</p><p><strong>Alma maters: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>University of Kerala; the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras; the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.</p><p>Thomas, an expert in power systems and smart grids, is working to get more women into the power and energy industry.</p><p>She is an active IEEE volunteer, having worked with student branches and membership recruitment. As a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/technology-sustainable-climate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization</a>, she shares her knowledge about energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and ozone-layer recovery.</p><p>\u201cFor a woman to succeed, she needs a lot of family support,\u201d Thomas says, because many women\u2019s careers are interrupted by caretaking and child-rearing responsibilities. She acknowledges that not all women have the same support system she has\u2014which is part of the reason why she is dedicated to helping others succeed.</p><h2>A passion for teaching</h2><p>Thomas was born and raised in Kerala, India. Kerala students who excelled at school were expected to choose a career in either medicine or engineering, she says. Medicine wasn\u2019t an option for her, she says, because she faints at the sight of blood. She was good at mathematics, though, so she chose to pursue engineering.</p><p>Although both her parents were teachers (her father taught chemistry; her mother was a language instructor), she wasn\u2019t inspired to pursue a similar path until she was an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://keralauniversity.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Kerala</a>. Her extensive note-taking during class made her popular among her classmates, she says, and some would ask her to tutor them during exam season.</p><p>\u201cMy friends would come over to my home so I could explain the material to them using my notes,\u201d she says. \u201cAfterward, they would tell me that they were able to understand the subject much better than how the professor had explained it. That\u2019s what inspired me to become a teacher.\u201d</p><p>After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1984, Thomas continued her education at the <a href=\"https://www.iitm.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Madras</a>. Shortly after earning her master\u2019s of technology in electrical engineering in 1986, she began her first teaching job at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, also in Kerala.</p><p>The year was a whirlwind for Thomas, who got married, left her job, and moved to New Delhi, where her husband lived. Instead of searching for another teaching job, she decided to pursue a doctoral degree in the electrical engineering program at the <a href=\"https://www.iitd.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi</a>.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I was 28, I had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which I earned in 1990,\u201d she says. \u201cI soon got a job at Delhi Technological University, the only other college in New Delhi that had an engineering school at that time, other than IIT. From there, I never looked back.\u201d</p><p>She taught at the university for five years, then left in 1995 to join Jamia Millia Islamia. She eventually was promoted to lead the electrical engineering department.</p><p>During her 11 years there, she established labs to conduct research in supervisory control and data acquisition (<a href=\"https://inductiveautomation.com/resources/article/what-is-scada\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SCADA</a>) and substation automation, collaborating with industry on projects. In 2003 she created a curriculum for\u2014and led the launch of\u2014a master\u2019s of technology program in electrical power system management as well as a training program for industry professionals. For her work, she received a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/awards/meritorious-award\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities Board Meritorious Achievement Award</a>.</p><p>In 2014 she founded the school\u2019s <a href=\"https://jmi.ac.in/cie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a> to help startups turn their ideas into prototypes and launch businesses.</p><p>She received an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse in 2016: become president of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli.</p><p>\u201cThis was a great honor to become the first woman president of that institute,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the only woman among 90 presidents of all the institutions of national importance at that time.\u201d</p><p>But, she says, as president, she didn\u2019t have much time to teach, and after five years, she began to miss her time in the classroom. After her five-year term was completed, she returned to Jamia Millia Islamia in 2021 as engineering dean. Since then, she has led the launch of five programs: three undergraduate programs (in data science, electrical and computer engineering, and VLSI) and graduate programs in data science and environmental sciences.</p><p>This year she stepped down after completing her three-year term as dean and is focusing more on teaching.</p><p>She teaches at least one class each semester because, she says, she finds joy in \u201cimparting and giving knowledge to young minds.\u201d</p><h2>Mentoring women in the power industry</h2><p>Thomas mentors doctoral students as well as professors who aspire to serve as deans or other high-level positions.</p><p>In addition, she trains mid-career women in the power industry on the skills they need to get promoted\u2014to technical and senior management roles\u2014through the <a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/the-wepowernetwork.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">South Asia WePOWER network</a>\u2019s South Asia Region (SAR) 100 professional development program. WePOWER is a coalition of nonprofit and government organizations that aim to increase the number of women working in the power and energy sectors through education. A<a href=\"https://collaboration.worldbank.org/content/sites/collaboration-for-development/en/groups/weesa-innovate-to-empower/documents.entry.html/2024/05/31/pathways_to_powersouthasiabaselineassessment-ILv3.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 2020 World Bank study</a> found that the percentage of women in technical roles in the industry in South Asia ranges from 0.1 to 21.</p><p>The six-month-long program provides technical training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to 100 women from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Thomas is one of 40 experts who remotely teach topics such as transmission details, distribution, renewable energy, and the importance of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-updates-2025\" target=\"_self\">women in leadership</a>.</p><p>She also mentors women to give them confidence and tools to reach leadership positions because \u201cmentorship is what changed my career trajectory,\u201d she says. When she first began teaching, she says she was reluctant to take high-level positions. But after participating in a six-day leadership training at the <a href=\"https://www.jnu.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a>, which was hosted by the Government of India\u2019s <a href=\"https://ugc.gov.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University Grants Commission</a>, she felt confident in her ability to move up the career ladder.</p><p>\u201cMany women take a break from their careers to raise their children, struggle to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/work-life-balance\" target=\"_self\">balance their personal and professional lives</a>, or don\u2019t have a support system,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to impart the lessons I learned from my experiences and the training I received. Whenever I get a chance, I get involved.\u201d</p><h2>Creating lifelong friendships and mentoring students</h2><p>Thomas joined IEEE in 1990 as a graduate student member and says she continues renewing her membership to stay up to date on emerging technologies, specifically SCADA systems.</p><p>\u201cI learned everything about SCADA from a tutorial developed by the <a href=\"https://ieee-pes.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Power & Energy Society</a>. There was no such material available at that time,\u201d she says.</p><p>Years later, in 2015, Thomas cowrote <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/power-system-scada-and-smart-grids-mini-s-thomas/1133718207\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Power System SCADA and Smart Grids</em></em></a> with her friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndougmcdonald\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John McDonald</a>, whom she met through the organization. McDonald is an IEEE Life Fellow and the founder and CEO of JDM Associates in Duluth, Ga.</p><p>Thomas became an active volunteer for the <a href=\"https://www.ieeedtu.in/IEEEDTU/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delhi Technological University\u2019s student branch</a>, where she helped organize technical talks and other events. When Thomas joined Jamia Millia Islamia, she revived the inactive <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/company/ieeejmi-sb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">student branch</a> there and served as its counselor for 14 years.</p><p>During her 35 years with IEEE, she has served as chair of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities/regional-list-region-10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Region 10</a> student activities committee and vice chair of membership development for <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities</a>. She was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education/eab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities</a> and the <a href=\"https://pspb.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Publication Services and Products</a> boards.</p><p>\u201cCreating programs that benefit members makes me feel satisfied,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cVolunteering has also boosted my confidence.\u201d</p><p>She is also a member of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a>\u2019s editorial advisory board.</p><p>Not only does she attribute much of her professional growth to the organization, she also has created lifelong friendships through IEEE, she says. One friend is 2023 IEEE President <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/saifur-rahman-a\" target=\"_self\">Saifur Rahman</a>, whom she met in 2000 when he spoke to the Jamia Millia Islamia student branch.</p><p>\u201cOur friendship has grown so much that Saifur is like family,\u201d she says.</p><p>When Rahman launched the IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization in 2022, he asked Thomas to become a member. She helped create the <a href=\"https://innovate.ieee.org/the-ieee-climate-change-collection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Climate Change Collection</a> on the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Xplore</a> Digital Library. The following year, she led the development of a climate change taxonomy. The 620 words are included in the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Thesaurus</a>, which defines almost 12,500 engineering, technical, and scientific terms. Now she is working with a team to expand the taxonomy by defining hundreds more climate-change terms.</p><p>\u201cYou should always do what you enjoy. For me, that\u2019s teaching and volunteering with IEEE,\u201d she says. \u201cI could just be a member, access the technical content, and be happy with just that, but I volunteer because I can do things that help others.\u201d</p>"

After multiple consultations with the family, the Whitworth team delivered their system.</p><p>\u201cThe station is very user-friendly, allowing Ryken to focus on his first-grade studies and putting him at eye-level with those speaking to him,\u201d says Schipf. \u201cHe will also be able to move throughout the house as needed.\u201d</p><p>The first grader, Ryken, has a form of <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cerebral-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353999\" target=\"_blank\">cerebral palsy</a> along with other disabilities, which include epilepsy, hearing, and visual impairments.</p><p>Ryken\u2019s mother had initially contacted Schipf because Ryken was unable to participate fully in his education. And she\u2019d discovered a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-hand-editorial\" target=\"_blank\">lack of suitable equipment</a> on the market that Ryken could use to meet his needs.<span></span></p><span><h3>What Is User-Centered Design in Assistive Tech?</h3><p><span>As advocates for </span><a href=\"https://uxpajournal.org/ucd-method-assistive-switch-devices-accessibility/#:~:text=UCD%20is%20a%20design%20philosophy,every%20stage%20(Figure%201).\" target=\"_blank\">user-centered design (UCD)</a><span> have pointed out, functional </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/blind-tech\" target=\"_self\">assistive tech</a><span> needs to \u201canswer the needs\u201d of the person it\u2019s designed for\u2014not just the needs of people designing it. </span></p><p>As one example, Shipf points to the station\u2019s high-contrast black background, which allowed Ryken to view anything placed in front of him easily. \u201cIt had to have some adjustable features for his caregivers and for his teacher,\u201d Schipf says. \u201cAnd his mother wanted the seat on the learning center to be able to be raised up and lowered according to what he was doing at the time. So if he\u2019s learning with his teacher to have it be lower to the ground, and then if he\u2019s in the kitchen with his mom, to have it raise up to counter height.\u201d</p></span><span><p>\u201cThe raising and lowering came from an electrical raising and lowering kind of a piston that we purchased,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd it\u2019s usually designed for kitchen tables for families that want a kitchen table that can raise and lower. So it had the load capacity that we needed.

The project focused on developing an emergency communication device for a young woman in the Spokane area. She is in her 20s and is mobile but has speech difficulties. The project originated from her father\u2019s concern for her well-being in case something happened to him while she was outdoors or traveling through the city.</p><p>The device fits within a fanny pack. The concept behind the device is simple. In the event of an emergency, the device is intended to send an SMS message to preprogrammed recipients with the press of a button.</p><p>\u201cThis father, he\u2019s a little bit older, and he has some health problems,\u201d Schipf says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s really concerned that he\u2019s going to be on a hike with his daughter and that he\u2019s going to pass out or something\u2019s going to happen to him, and then she is going to be left alone without anybody to understand her speech and anybody to help her out. \u2026 And so we designed an electrical system that fits in a fanny pack.\u201d</p><p>The device, Schipf says, has big, textured buttons that allow the wearer to send geolocated SMS alerts, in case of emergency. \u201cSo it\u2019s location tracking and an SMS service,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd then the other button on the device plays an audio message that tells any stranger she encounters to call her father.\u201d</p><p>Both devices showcase the power of both collaboration and assistive technology. Although these devices were created for specific individuals, the technology used to make them can be modified or duplicated to serve the larger disability community as a whole.</p><p>\u201cI know both the engineering students and the occupational therapy and physical therapy students, it\u2019s much more meaningful to them when they get to see the face and talk to the actual clients,\u201d says Ericsson. \u201cIt\u2019s much more meaningful than just a textbook case study that we give them.\u201d</p>"

They can be engineered into strange, but functional, energy-storage devices called supercapacitors.</p><p>As their name suggests, supercapacitors are like capacitors with greater capacity. Similar to batteries, they can store a lot of energy, but they can also charge or discharge quickly, similar to a capacitor. They\u2019re usually found where a lot of power is needed quickly and for a limited time, like as a nearly instantaneous backup electricity for a factory or data center.</p><p>Typically, supercapacitors are made up of two activated carbon or graphene electrodes, electrolytes to introduce ions to the system, and a porous sheet of polymer or glass fiber to physically separate the electrodes. When a supercapacitor is fully charged, all of the positive ions gather on one side of the separating sheet, while all of the negative ions are on the other. When it\u2019s discharged, the ions are randomly distributed, and it can switch between these states much faster than <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stretchable-lithium-ion-battery\" target=\"_blank\">batteries</a> can.</p><p>Some scientists believe that supercapacitors could become <em><em>more </em></em>super. They think there\u2019s potential to make these devices more sustainably, at lower-cost, and maybe even better performing if they\u2019re built from better materials.</p><p>And maybe they\u2019re right. Last month, a group from Michigan Technological University reported making supercapacitors from plastic water bottles that had a higher capacitance than commercial ones.</p><p>Does this finding mean recycled plastic supercapacitors will soon be everywhere? The history of similar supercapacitor sustainability experiments suggests not.</p><p>About 15 years ago, it <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/winner-super-charged\" target=\"_self\">seemed like supercapacitors were going to be in high demand</a>. Then, because of huge investments in lithium-ion technology, batteries became tough competition, explains <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/G/gogotsi-yury/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yury Gogotsi</a>, who studies materials for energy-storage devices at Drexel University, in Philadelphia. \u201cThey became so much cheaper and so much faster in delivering energy that for supercapacitors, the range of application became more limited,\u201d he says. \u201cBasically, the trend went from making them cheaper and available to making them perform where lithium-ion batteries cannot.\u201d</p><p>Still, some researchers remain hopeful that environmentally friendly devices have a place in the market. <a href=\"https://www.mtu.edu/materials/department/faculty/hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yun Hang Hu</a>, a materials scientist on the Michigan Technological University team, sees \u201ca promising path to commercialization [for the water-bottle-derived supercapacitor] once collection and processing challenges are addressed,\u201d he says.</p><p>Here\u2019s how scientists make supercapacitors with strange, unexpected materials:</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"water\"><span>Water Bottles</span></h2><p>It turns out your old Poland Spring bottle could one day store energy instead of water. Last month in the journal <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5c03370\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Energy & Fuels</em></em></a>, the Michigan Technological University team published a new method for converting polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the material that makes up single-use plastic water bottles, into both electrodes and separators.</p><p>As odd as it may seem, this process is \u201ca practical blueprint for circular energy storage that can ride the existing PET supply chain,\u201d says Hu.</p><p>To make the electrodes, the researchers first shredded bottles into 2-millimeter grains and then added powdered calcium hydroxide. They heated the mixture to 700 \u00b0C in a vacuum for 3 hours and were left with an electrically conductive carbon powder. After removing residual calcium and activating the carbon (increasing its surface area), they could shape the powder into a thin layer and use it as an electrode.</p><p>The process to produce the separators was much less intensive\u2014the team cut bottles into squares about the size of a U.S. quarter or a 1-euro coin and used hot needles to poke holes in them. They optimized the pattern of the holes for the passage of current using specialized software. PET is a good material for a separator because of its \u201cexcellent mechanical strength, high thermal stability, and excellent insulation,\u201d Hu says.</p><p><span>Filled with an electrolyte solution, the resulting supercapacitor not only demonstrated potential for eco- and finance-friendly material usage, but also slightly outperformed traditional materials on one metric. The PET device had a capacitance of 197.2 farads per gram, while an analogous device with a glass-fiber separator had a capacitance of 190.3 farads per gram.</span></p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"eggs\">Eggs</h2><p>Wait, don\u2019t make your breakfast sandwich just yet! You could engineer a supercapacitor from one of your ingredients instead. In 2019, a University of Virginia team <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285519307529\" target=\"_blank\">showed</a> that electrodes, electrolytes, and separators could all be made from parts of a single object\u2014an egg.</p><p>First, the group purchased grocery store chicken eggs and sorted their parts into eggshells, eggshell membranes, and the whites and yolks.</p><p>They ground the shells into a powder and mixed them with the egg whites and yolks. The slurry was freeze-dried and brought up to 950 \u00b0C for an hour to decompose. After a cleaning process to remove calcium, the team performed heat and potassium treatments to activate the remaining carbon. They then smoothed the egg-derived activated carbon into a film to be used as electrodes. Finally, by mixing egg whites and yolks with potassium hydroxide and letting it dry for several hours, they formed a kind of gel electrolyte.</p><p>To make separators, the group simply cleaned the eggshell membranes. Because the membranes naturally have interlaced micrometer-size fibers, their inherent structures allow for ions to move across them just as manufactured separators would.</p><p>Interestingly, the resulting fully egg-based supercapacitor was flexible, with its capacitance staying steady even when the device was twisted or bent. After 5,000 cycles, the supercapacitor retained 80 percent of its original capacitance\u2014low compared to commercial supercapacitors, but fairly on par for others made from natural materials.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"hemp\"><span>Hemp</span></h2><p>Some people may like cannabis for more medicinal purposes, but it has potential in energy storage, too. In 2024, a group from Ondokuz May\u0131s University in T\u00fcrkiye <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X23032772\" target=\"_blank\">used</a> <a href=\"https://www.omu.edu.tr/tr/icerik/haber/turkiyenin-ilk-tescilli-endustriyel-kenevir-tohumu-vezir-ve-narli-oldu#images-3\" target=\"_blank\">pomegranate hemp plants</a> to produce activated carbon for an electrode.</p><p>They started by drying stems of the hemp plants in a 110 \u00b0C oven for a day and then ground the stems into a powder. Next, they added sulfuric acid and heat to create a biochar, and, finally, activated the char by saturating it with potassium hydroxide and heating it again.</p><p>After 2,000 cycles, the supercapacitor with hemp-derived electrodes still retained 98 percent of its original capacitance, which is, astoundingly, in range of those made from nonbiological materials. The carbon itself had an energy density of 65 watt-hours per kilogram, also in line with commercial supercapacitors.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"cement\">Cement</h2><p>It may have a hold over the construction industry, but is cement coming for the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_blank\">energy sector</a>, too? In 2023, a group from MIT <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2304318120\" target=\"_blank\">shared</a> how they designed electrodes from water, nearly pure carbon, and cement. Using these materials, they say, creates a \u201csynergy\u201d between the hydrophilic cement and hydrophobic carbon that aids the electrodes\u2019 ability to hold layers of ions when the supercapacitor is charged.</p><p>To test the hypothesis, the team built eight electrodes using slightly different proportions of the three ingredients, different types of carbon, and different electrode thicknesses. The electrodes were saturated with potassium chloride\u2014an electrolyte\u2014and capacitance measurements began.</p><p>Impressively, the cement supercapacitors were able to maintain capacitance with little loss even after 10,000 cycles. The researchers also calculated that one of their supercapacitors could store around 10 kilowatt-hours\u2014enough to serve about one third of an average American\u2019s daily energy use\u2014though the number is only theoretical.</p>"

As a result, companies are considering different programs to evaluate workers\u2019 skills for industry-readiness. Apprenticeships, vocational programs, and professional certifications are great ways to fill the talent pipeline, but companies still need a method to assess whether learners have the required skills. One way is through skills-based <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-microcredential-program\" target=\"_self\">microcredentials</a>.</p><h2>What are microcredentials?</h2><p>Microcredentials can validate specialized skills in high-demand technical areas such as clean-room safety, manufacturing equipment repair, and data analysis. Learners earn microcredentials by demonstrating their skills through an assessment designed to evaluate them.</p><p>Microcredentials are stackable, allowing learners to earn multiple credentials within a single defined area, showing a growing skill set. They are also verifiable and digitally shareable, enabling employers to see the skills that each learner has acquired.</p><h2>Difference makers</h2><p><em><em>Credential</em></em> is an umbrella term for achievements professionals earn through educational programs. Non-degree credentials often are earned over a shorter period of time, cost less, and can be used to highlight skills for specialized roles. Some common types of credentials include certifications and microcredentials.</p><p>Certifications validate mastery of a specific body of knowledge through a rigorous exam, and they often require ongoing education. They typically are given for completing a training course and passing an assessment test to earn professional credits or fulfill licensing requirements.</p><p>Microcredentials can be more accessible because they take less time to earn and are more affordable. They also have fewer rules governing their definition. Industry recognition, the issuer\u2019s reputation, and third-party validation of the program can help assure their quality.</p><h2>Who can earn microcredentials?</h2><p>Prospective employees and those currently working in technology fields can use microcredentials to demonstrate newly acquired knowledge. <a href=\"https://credentials.ieee.org/credentials/ieee-microcredentials/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microcredentials</a> can help entry-level professionals gain the knowledge and skills needed to join fields such as electronics, mechanics, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/\" target=\"_self\">semiconductor manufacturing</a>.</p><h2>Getting started with IEEE</h2><p>As companies look for valuable credentials to help ease their labor shortages, IEEE has the credibility and infrastructure to offer trusted verification of skills-based microcredentials that meet industry needs and create new opportunities for those traditionally underrepresented in technical fields.</p><p><a href=\"https://ea.ieee.org/ea-programs\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Educational Activities</a> has been partnering with training providers, conference organizers, and industry leaders to validate training programs and issue verified professional technical credentials for more than 30 years.</p><p>To learn more about IEEE microcredentials and how your organization can offer them, check out the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/education-career/continue-your-education/ieee-credentialing-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Credentialing Program web page</a> or <a href=\"https://credentials.ieee.org/contact/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>"

According to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/landontessmer/?originalSubdomain=ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Landon Tessmer</a>, vice president of<strong> </strong>commercial operations at ProEnergy, some data centers are using his company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.proenergyservices.com/aero-advantage/parts-equipment/pe6000/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.proenergyservices.com/aero-advantage/parts-equipment/pe6000/\">PE6000</a> gas turbines to provide the power needed during the data center\u2019s construction and during its first few years of operation. When grid power is available, these machines either revert to a backup role, supplement the grid, or are sold to the local utility.</p><p>\u201cWe have sold 21 gas turbines for two data-center projects amounting to more than 1 gigawatt,\u201d says Tessmer. \u201cBoth projects are expected to provide bridging power for five to seven years, which is when they expect to have grid interconnection and no longer need permanent behind-the-meter generation.\u201d</p><h2>Bridging Power Gaps With a New Kind of Aeroderivative Turbine</h2><p>It is a common and long-established practice for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/gas-turbines-have-become-by-far-the-best-choice-for-addon-generating-power\" target=\"_blank\">gas-turbine</a> original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like <a href=\"https://www.gevernova.com/gas-power\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GE Vernova</a> and <a href=\"https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/home/products-services/product-offerings/gas-turbines.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens Energy</a> to convert a successful aircraft engine for stationary electric-power generation applications. Known as aeroderivative gas turbines, these machines have carved out a niche for themselves because they\u2019re lighter, smaller, and more easily maintained than traditional heavy-frame gas turbines.</p><p>\u201cIt takes a lot to industrialize an aviation engine and make it generate power,\u201d says Mark Axford, President of Axford Turbine Consultants, a gas-turbine consultant and a valuation expert for used turbines.</p><p>For example, GE Vernova\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gevernova.com/gas-power/products/gas-turbines/lm6000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LM6000 gas turbine</a> was derived from GE\u2019s successful CF6-80C2 turbofan engine which was widely used on commercial jets. The CF6-80C2 was first released in 1985, and the LM6000 appeared on the market five years later. To make it suitable for power generation, it needed an expanded turbine section to convert engine thrust into shaft power, a series of struts and supports to mount it on a concrete deck or steel frame, and new controls. Further modifications typically include the development of fuel nozzles that let the machine run on natural gas rather than aviation fuel, and a combustor that minimizes the emission of nitrogen oxides, a major pollutant.</p><p>\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough gas turbines to go around and the problem is probably going to get worse,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.whartonenergy.com/paul_browning_2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Browning</a>,<strong> </strong>CEO of <a href=\"https://generativepower.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Generative Power Solutions</a>, formerly the head of GE Power & Water (now GE Vernova) and <a href=\"https://power.mhi.com/products/gasturbines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mitsubishi Power</a>. Contact GE Vernova to order an LM6000 today and you might be told the waiting list is anywhere from three to five years. You\u2019d hear the same from Siemens Energy for its <a href=\"https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en/home/products-services/product/sgt-a35.html#/\" target=\"_blank\">SGT-A35</a> aeroderivative gas turbine. Some large, popular, models have even longer waiting lists.</p><p>For contrast, \u201ca PE6000 from ProEnergy can be delivered in 2027,\u201d Tessmer says.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" Landon Tessmer speaking behind a podium in front an audience at the Data Center World Power show.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e504e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/landon-tessmer-speaking-behind-a-podium-in-front-an-audience-at-the-data-center-world-power-show.jpg?id=61774968&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\"> Landon Tessmer, ProEnergy\u2019s vice president  of commercial operations, spoke at the Data Center World Power conference in October 2025.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Data Center World Power</small></p><h2>Converted Turbofan Aircraft Engine Can Provide 48 Megawatts</h2><p>ProEnergy buys and overhauls used <a href=\"https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/datasheet-CF6-80C2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CF6-80C2</a> engine cores\u2014the central part of the engine where combustion occurs\u2014and matches them with newly manufactured aeroderivative parts made either by ProEnergy or its partners. After assembly and testing, these refurbished engines are ready for a second life in electric-power generation, where they provide 48 megawatts, enough to power a small-to-medium data center (or a town of perhaps <a href=\"https://spellmanfemenino.edu.ec/how-many-homes-can-1-mw-power/\" target=\"_blank\">20,000 to 40,000</a> households). According to Tessmer, approximately 1,000 of these aircraft engines are expected to be retired over the next decade, so there\u2019s no shortage of them. A large data center may have demand that <a href=\"https://www.integrityenergy.com/blog/is-data-center-energy-usage-driving-up-my-energy-bills/\" target=\"_blank\">exceeds 100 MW</a>, and some of the latest data centers being designed for AI are more than 1 GW.</p><p>An overhaul returns an engine and its components to as-new condition. Each of its thousands of parts are disassembled, cleaned, inspected, and then repaired or replaced as needed. In this way, the engine is renewed for another long cycle of run time. Apart from the engine core, every part inside the PE6000 turbine is manufactured to ProEnergy\u2019s specifications. <strong><span>\u201c</span></strong>We can overhaul the high-pressure core of any CF6-80C2 and fabricate all the low-pressure components,\u201d Tessmer adds.</p><p>ProEnergy sells two-turbine blocks with the standard configuration. It consists of gas turbines, generators, and a host of other gear, such as systems to cool the air entering the turbine during hot days as a way to boost performance, selective catalytic reduction systems to reduce emissions, and various electrical systems. The company focuses solely on one engine, the CF6-80C2, to streamline and simplify engineering and maintenance.</p><p>The PE6000 was originally intended for use by utilities that needed more capacity during peak hours. The <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-concrete\" target=\"_blank\">data-center boom</a> has turned that expectation on its head\u2014data-center operators want these engines to provide power to the entire facility. They run on natural gas and, when being started, can be up and running in 5 minutes. If one needs maintenance, it can be swapped out with a spare within 72 hours. Emissions levels average 2.5 parts per million for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-centers-pollution\" target=\"_blank\">nitrogen oxide</a>, which is well below <a href=\"https://www.uspeglobal.com/blog/70342-understanding-gas-turbine-emissions-limits-in-the-u-s-a-comprehensive-guide-by-usp-e\" target=\"_blank\">EPA-regulated levels</a> (generally below 10 to below 25 parts per million, depending on the use case). Since 2020, ProEnergy has fabricated 75 PE6000 packages and now has another 52 being assembled or on order.</p><h2>Lengthy Grid-Connection Delays Mean More Business</h2><p>Multiple factors contribute to this popularity. Besides the surge in data centers, there\u2019s often a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-shortage\" target=\"_blank\">lengthy wait for transmission lines</a>, which may face local opposition and require permits from multiple municipalities or states. \u201cAeroderivative gas turbines are gaining ground as a bridging technology that runs behind the meter until the utility is able to supply grid power,\u201d says Tessmer.</p><p>Tessmer has seen examples of eight-to-ten-year delays on permitting alone. If connecting to the grid continues to take years, at least in some areas, and if gas turbine manufacturers don\u2019t dramatically boost output, bridging power could become an indispensable enabler of the buildout of AI infrastructure.</p>"
