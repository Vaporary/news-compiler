Treated startups are more likely to shut down their businesses and do so sooner than control startups. Conditional on survival, however, treated startups are more likely to raise external funding for their ventures, raise funding faster, and raise more funding than the control group; they also exhibit higher employment and revenue. Treated founders are less likely to found a new startup after shutdown. Our findings are consistent with practitioner arguments that early entrepreneurship training interventions can help entrepreneurs with less viable ventures \u201crationally quit\u201d (\u201cfail fast\u201d).

We first describe the data patterns, showing the relative decline of the UK, and the rise first of the US and Germany, and then later of Japan and China. We then econometrically estimate trajectories on (i) the post-1902 period for France, Germany, Japan, the UK and US, and (ii) the post-1960 period for a wider sample of 40 countries. Our trajectories are strongly positively correlated with Total Factor Productivity growth, and also (but less strongly) associated with the growth of labour productivity and capital intensity. We show that future trajectories are predicted by a country\u2019s initial levels of R&amp;D, education and defence spending, classic drivers of innovation in modern growth theory."

        "summary": "Are competition policies designed for static industries suitable for innovative industries where dynamic competition for the market is key? If not, how should policies differ? We develop a model of the life-cycle of an oligopolistic industry: a version of Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994) with a finite number of firms. The equilibrium features a period of intense entry, followed by a shakeout and eventual industry concentration as some firms scale through innovation while most exit. We analyze the second-best problem of a government subsidizing small firms to promote competition. Innovation and dynamic competition do not necessarily justify intervention, as the equilibrium can still be second best. In general, the optimal policy depends on the nature of competition. Firms primarily compete for the market when innovation leads to large differences in scale. The government can wait to intervene in this case; committing to do whatever it takes to promote competition if and when the industry concentrates excessively. Subsidies early in the life-cycle are unnecessary. These results contrast with calls for aggressive ex-ante regulation in highly innovative industries, suggesting a wait-and-see approach may be preferable. We apply these insights to digital and AI industries in the U.S. using data on venture-backed firms."

        "summary": "The task-based approach has become the dominant framework for studying the labor-market effects of artificial intelligence (AI), typically emphasizing the replacement of human workers by machines. Motivated by growing empirical evidence that contemporary AI is more often used as a tool that augments workers, this paper develops two related task-based models in which AI enhances worker productivity without automating tasks. Abstracting from capital, we develop a pair of related task-based models that examine how technological progress in AI that provides new tools to augment workers affects aggregate productivity and wage inequality. Both models emphasize the role of human capital in intermediating the effects of AI-related technological shocks. In the first model, AI use requires specialized expertise, and technological progress expands the set of tasks for which such expertise is effective. We show that a larger supply of AI expertise amplifies the productivity gains from improvements in AI technology while attenuating its adverse effects on wage inequality. The second model focuses on non-AI skills, allowing AI tools to alter the set of tasks that workers can perform given their skills. In equilibrium, workers allocate across tasks in response to wages, generating an endogenous distribution of skills across the task space. A central result is that aggregate productivity and wage inequality depend on different global properties of this equilibrium distribution: productivity is particularly sensitive to thinly staffed tasks that create bottlenecks, while wage inequality is driven by the concentration of workers in a narrow set of tasks. As a result, improvements in AI tools can induce non-monotonic co-movement between productivity and inequality. By linking these mechanisms to multidimensional human capital---including AI expertise and higher-order non-AI skills---the paper highlights the role of education and training policies in shaping the economic consequences of AI-driven technological change."

        "summary": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for cutting transportation emissions, yet the policy drivers of EV innovation remain underexplored. This study analyzes firm-level panel data on EV and battery patents, covering more than 4,000 firms across 19 countries from 2010 to 2021, to assess how these policy tools and their interactions in different time horizons influence innovative activity. We test the effects of individual policy instruments that either raise demand for EVs or support the development of EV technologies.  Stringent fuel-economy standards, financial incentives, adoption targets, and public R&amp;D investments each significantly increase patenting in EV and battery technologies. Moreover, long-term EV targets amplify the innovative impact of public R&amp;D and standards while diminishing the marginal effect of short-term price signals. The results suggest that governments can accelerate clean automotive innovation by combining long-term adoption commitments with sustained R&amp;D investment or strong performance standards, and by managing these instruments as a coordinated policy portfolio rather than as separate tools. The study contributes cross-country, firm-level evidence that links policy design to the direction of clean technology innovation."

Friedman developed the modern quantity of money in 1956 as a challenge to the prevailing Keynesian view that \u201cmoney did not matter.\u201d Friedman\u2019s empirical and historical research made a strong case that changes in the money supply, largely instituted by the monetary authorities, account for much of the macro instability in the twentieth century including the Great Recession 1929-1933 and the Great Inflation 1965 -1982. Friedman\u2019s ideas were at the base of the creation of modern macroeconomics, and of the adoption by many central banks of rules based monetary policy as a guidepost to maintain credibility for low inflation. His emphasis on monetary aggregates as the key monetary policy tool has been superseded by the use of policy interest rates, but the monetary aggregates are still useful as a crosscheck against incipient high inflation."

We link US-born sons observed in 1900, 1920, and 1940 full-count Censuses to their fathers, and construct a measure of county-level exposure to the 1920s immigration acts, which sharply curtailed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. Exploiting this policy-induced variation, we find that the quotas reduced intergenerational mobility among US-born white men, but had no adverse effect for Black men. Among whites, losses were smaller for sons of richer fathers, who were more likely to migrate away from highly exposed areas. Evidence from the 1940 Census indicates that exposed white men were less likely to be employed and earned lower wages in adulthood, consistent with both occupational downgrading and reduced productivity within occupations. We show that these effects operated through both reduced immigrant\u2013native complementarities and incomplete substitution from unrestricted migration, while human capital investment can  explain at most only a modest part of the total effect."

We conceptualize individual utility from a given action as a function of three components: intrinsic valuations, material payoffs, and social interactions. Using this lens, we review evidence on interventions that target each component and their interactions.\nFirst, we discuss efforts to shift intrinsic values through schooling and curricula, information campaigns, mass media, and empowerment programs, with particular attention to gender norms, intimate partner violence, and harmful practices such as female genital cutting. Second, we examine social determinants of behavior, including misperceptions about others\u2019 beliefs, coordination failures, and the role of intermediate \u201cstepping-stone\u201d actions in facilitating or hindering norm transitions. Third, we analyze how changes in material incentives, via labor market opportunities, transfers, and legal reforms, affect behavior and underlying norms.\nThroughout, we highlight methodological challenges in measuring norms and identifying mechanisms, and we emphasize that policy effects depend critically on existing social structures and belief distributions. We conclude by outlining open questions from a positive and normative perspective."

One I faced was whether to participate in a development project involving teams from around the world. It presented a great opportunity for personal and professional enrichment.</p><p>Throughout my 40-year career with <a href=\"https://www.honeywell.com/us/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Honeywell</a>, I have held leadership roles for such projects in Australia, China, Finland, and India.</p><p>You might be offered similar assignments. Here are some benefits of taking on international projects.</p><h2>Gain professional insights and advancement</h2><p>As a rule, international projects are large in scope and involve many critical components, making them ideal for your professional growth. Such projects are likely to be identified by your organization as essential to the business and, as such, present opportunities for individual achievement and recognition.</p><p>They also can give you the opportunity to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/advice-leading-mentoring-greater-innovation\" target=\"_self\">work with many technical aspects</a>\u2014which would allow you to see beyond the scope of smaller-scale projects.</p><p>Likewise, you can gain an understanding of different global markets and how to meet diverse customer needs.</p><p>It can significantly expand your company\u2019s market reach to enter new geographic areas. It also can lead to a better understanding of local preferences, regulations, and technical standards, making the products more appealing to customers in other countries.</p><h2>Planning for working globally</h2><p>When embarking on a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotic-process-automation-gokul-pandy\" target=\"_self\">global, multisite assignment,</a> seek help to define your role. The project could require you to take on several different positions such as project manager, program manager, scrum leader, architect, requirements analyst, designer, and user experience lead. Which role would be best suited for you? You should decide based on your skills, long-term career growth, and the project\u2019s needs.</p><p>Regardless of which role you have, it is important to have an understanding of the team\u2019s other members, including their skills and competencies and how best to interact with them.</p><p>A key decision early on is whether you\u2019ll have to colocate at one location and, if so, for how long. There are different types of colocation, including frequent travel between offices, a temporary relocation known as a \u201cbubble assignment,\u201d and an expatriate assignment that involves relocating to another country for a period of time.</p><p>Travel between offices makes sense when there are more than two locations involved in the project and your role requires your presence at each. Although weekly communication can be done via virtual meetings, there is no substitute for occasional face-to-face interaction.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Participation in global product development empowers engineers to drive innovation, achieve career growth, and make a meaningful impact in the global marketplace and on society itself.</span></p><p>Bubble assignments require longer on-site presence but without the rigor and complexity of an expat assignment. Generally, bubble assignments last three to six months.</p><p>Expat assignments are suitable when the project scope requires a multiyear engagement. They involve relocating to that country for the duration of the project. You and your employer should be clear about taxes, salary, benefits, housing, and other implications.</p><p>Your compensation is a significant consideration. It\u2019s not just about how much money you earn. Consider maintaining your salary in your home country\u2019s currency. The benefits include maintaining your bank and automatic payroll deposits, avoiding currency fluctuation and potentially adverse inflation.</p><p>Depending on the length of your stay, you might have to pay income tax in several countries. Make sure you understand the tax implications before embarking on any long assignments.</p><p>In addition, find out about your health insurance coverage when living abroad.</p><h2>Trust is the word</h2><p>Many critical aspects define a successful global assignment, including communication across time zones, managing cultural barriers and expectations, ensuring each site has employees with the expertise and skills needed, and setting clear project goals and time frames.</p><p>Most importantly, establish and maintain trust. Every member on the global team must have everyone\u2019s best interests, including the company\u2019s, in mind.</p><p>Trust is not easily gained, but it can be easily\u2014and quickly\u2014lost. To establish trust, the project leadership must be transparent, communicate frequently, set clear goals and boundaries, and define roles that match the participants\u2019 skills, capabilities, and long-term interests.</p><p>It\u2019s also critical that you and your team fulfill your promises on time.</p><h2>Overcoming challenges</h2><p>Large, complex, multilocation projects present other significant challenges that must be understood and managed.</p><p>Think about your company\u2019s organizational structure and boundaries. Is there a consistent reporting structure with shared goals and expectations? Or are there potentially competing interests at the executive level?</p><p>If the latter, think about how you will navigate those boundaries. And find a way to align the organization in a way that benefits all participants and teams.</p><p>A method Honeywell has used to navigate such challenges is to create a \u201chub and spoke\u201d approach to the critical disciplines of program management, architecture, and design. The approach includes offering management, verification, validation, and quality assurance with the intent that each participating site has representation in all four cornerstone areas.</p><p>Consider your computer systems. Is your company set up to allow for IT collaboration across sites and geographic boundaries? Having the right multisite computing privileges to ensure frictionless virtual teamwork is vital.</p><p>Are there legal issues such as export restrictions or government regulations? Are there intellectual property constraints when working with other countries? Also consider other impediments such as tariffs and customs duties; where the parts of your product are manufactured; product and component licensing; and use of open-source technology.</p><p>Addressing those issues starts with training the workforce in different countries about company-approved methods and restrictions, as well as having multisite tools that allow for intercountry collaboration.</p><h2>Discover personal enrichment</h2><p>In addition to contributing to your professional growth, actively engaging in a global development project can be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/influence-your-career\" target=\"_self\">personally enriching</a>. Working with people in different countries, with distinct cultures and languages, can broaden your understanding of the world and can create lasting friendships.</p><p>That can extend to your family by hosting international colleagues in your home country and by affording your family the ability to travel with you. Children and adults can benefit from engaging with diverse people from around the world.</p><p>Taking an active part in global development offers numerous advantages for an individual. You can broaden your horizons, gain exposure to diverse markets, and develop a deeper understanding of global consumer needs. The experience can enhance your problem-solving skills and encourage innovative thinking.</p><p>Engineers who navigate the challenges of global product development become more adept at overcoming communication barriers, managing logistical complexities, and adapting to varying consumer preferences.</p><p>Ultimately, active participation in global product development empowers engineers to drive innovation, achieve career growth, and make a meaningful impact in the global marketplace and on society itself.</p>"

Over the course of the conversation, she discussed the evolution of assistive technology over 40 years, the urgent need for affordable communication devices, and why the DIY movement matters now more than ever.</span></p><p><em><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum: </em></strong></em><strong>What got you started in assistive technology?</strong></p><p><strong>Therese Wilkomm: </strong>I grew up in Wisconsin where my father had a machine shop and worked on dairy and hog farms. At age ten, I started building and making things. A cousin was in a farm accident and needed modifications to his tractor, which introduced me to welding. In college, I enrolled in vocational rehabilitation and learned about rehab engineering\u2014assistive technology wasn\u2019t coined until 1988 with the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/senate-bill/2561\" target=\"_blank\">Technology-Related Assistance Act</a>. In 1979, <a href=\"https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/gregg-vanderheiden/\" target=\"_blank\">Gregg Vanderheiden</a> came to the University of Wisconsin-Stout and demonstrated creative things with garage door openers and communication devices. I thought, wow, this would be an awesome career path\u2014designing and fabricating devices and worksite adaptations for people with disabilities to go back to work and live independently. I haven\u2019t looked back.</p><p><strong>You\u2019ve created over 2,000 assistive technology solutions. What\u2019s your most memorable one?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm:</strong> A device for castrating pigs with one hand. We figured out a way to design a device that fit on the end of the hog crate that was foot-operated to hold the hind legs of the pig back so the procedure could be done with one hand.</p><h3>Assistive Technology\u2019s Changing Landscape </h3><p><strong>How has assistive technology evolved over the decades?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm: </strong>In the 1980s, we fabricated devices from wood and early electronics. I became a [<a href=\"https://www.resna.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America</a>, a.k.a. RESNA] member in 1985. The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/senate-bill/2561#:~:text=passed%20Senate%2C%20amended)-,Technology%2DRelated%20Assistance%20for%20Individuals%20With%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201988,of%20all%20ages%20with%20disabilities.\" target=\"_blank\">1988 Technology-Related Assistance Act</a> was transformational\u2014all fifty states finally got funding to support assistive technology and needs in rural areas. Back in the \u201880s, we were soldering and making battery interrupters and momentary switches for toys, radios, and music. Gregg was doing some things with communication. There were <a href=\"https://prc-saltillo.com/why-prc-saltillo/history\" target=\"_blank\">Prentke Romich</a> communication devices. Those were some of the first electronic assistive technologies.</p><p>The early 1990s was all about mobile rehab engineering. Senator Bob Dole <a href=\"https://www.eastersealstech.com/2014/08/27/crucial-part-creative-solution/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20grants%20funded,Willkomm%20said.\" target=\"_blank\">gave me a $50,000 grant</a> to fund my first mobile unit. That mobile unit had all my welding equipment, all my fabrication equipment, and I could drive farm to farm, set up outside right in front of the tractor, and fabricate whatever needed to be fabricated. Then around 1997, there were cuts in the school systems. Mobile units became really expensive to operate. We started to look at more efficient ways of providing assistive technology services. With the Tech Act, we had demonstration sites where people would come and try out different devices. But people had to get in a car, drive to a center, get out, find parking, come into the building\u2014a lot of time was being lost.</p><p>In the 2000s, more challenges with decreased funding. I discovered that with a Honda Accord and those crates you get from Staples, you could have your whole mobile unit in the trunk of your car because of advances in materials. We could make battery interrupters and momentary switches without ever having to solder. We can make switches in 28 seconds, battery interrupters in 18 seconds. When COVID happened, we had to pivot\u2014do more virtual, ship stuff out to people. We were able to serve more individuals during COVID than prior to COVID because nobody had to travel.</p><p><strong>How do you keep costs under five dollars?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm:</strong> I aim for five dollars or less. I get tons of corrugated plastic donated for free, so we spend no money on that. Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://scapaindustrial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scapa Tape</a>\u2014a very aggressive double-sided foam tape that costs five cents a foot. If you fabricate something, and it doesn\u2019t work out, and you have to reposition, you\u2019re out a nickel\u2019s worth of material. Buying Velcro in bulk helps too. Then<a href=\"https://instamorph.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Instamorph</a>\u2014it is non-toxic, biodegradable. You can reheat it, reform it, in five minutes or less up to six times. I\u2019ve created about 132 different devices just using Instamorph. A lot of things I make out of Instamorph don\u2019t necessarily work. I have a bucket and I reuse that Instamorph. We can get six, seven devices out of reusable Instamorph. That\u2019s how we keep it under five dollars.</p><p><strong>What key legislation impacts assistive technology?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm: </strong>Definitely the Technology-Related Assistance Act. In the school system, however, it only says \u201cdid you <em>consider</em> assistive technology?\u201d So that legislation really needs to be beefed up. The third piece of legislation I worked on was the <a href=\"https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/agrability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AgrAbility</a> legislation to fund assistive technology consultations and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers. The latest Technology-Related Assistance Act was <a href=\"https://ataporg.org/at-act-info/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reauthorized in 2022</a>. Not a whole lot of changes\u2014it\u2019s still assistive technology device demonstrations and loans, device reuse, training, technical assistance, information and awareness. The other thing is<a href=\"https://acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> NIDILRR</a>\u2014National Institute on Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research, funded under [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a.k.a. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services\" target=\"_blank\">HHS</a>]. Funding the rehab engineering centers was pretty significant in advancing the field because these were huge, multimillion-dollar centers dedicated to core areas like communication and employment. Now there\u2019s a new one out on artificial intelligence.</p><h3>A Vision for a Better Assistive Tech Future </h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Person wearing a floral-patterned, white shirt and beaded necklace outdoors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1a182\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-wearing-a-floral-patterned-white-shirt-and-beaded-necklace-outdoors.jpg?id=63527474&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Over more than 2,000 hacks to improve usability of assistive technologies, veteran DIY maker Therese Wilkomm has earned the moniker \u201cthe MacGyver of assistive tech.\u201d </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Therese Willkomm</small></p><p><strong>What deserves more focus in your field?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm:</strong> The supply-and-demand problem. It all comes down to time and money. We have an elderly population that continues to grow, and a disability population that continues to grow\u2014high demand, high need for assistive technology, yet the resources available to meet that need are limited. A few years back, the <a href=\"https://www.christopherreeve.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation</a> had a competition. I submitted a proposal similar to the <a href=\"https://topmealkitdelivery.com/compare-top/?utm_source=google&amp;keyword=how%20does%20blue%20apron%20work&amp;campaignid=19738344647&amp;adgroupid=147312616278&amp;targetid=kwd-119910014195&amp;device=c&amp;loc_physical=9001648&amp;net_type=g&amp;mt=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19738344647&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACWvR1todciLbxMtVpO1D33ERjChb&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAssfLBhBDEiwAcLpwfhQhzA6bmvh2gvcKuF296EMnhDCD_JjnPyNwHec6UsC5F7V2brgQGhoCabYQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Apron approach</a>. People don\u2019t have supplies at their house. They can\u2019t buy two inches of tape\u2014they have to buy a whole roll. They can\u2019t buy one foot of corrugated plastic\u2014they\u2019ve got to buy an 18-by-24 sheet or wait till it gets donated.</p><p>With my <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58523017-assistive-technology-solutions-in-minutes-book-iii---make-stuff-and-love\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">third book</a>, I created solutions with QR codes showing videos on how to make them. I used Christopher Reeve Foundation funding to purchase supplies. With Blue Apron, somebody wants to make dinner and a box arrives with a chicken breast, potato, vegetables, and recipe. I thought, what if we could apply that to assistive technology? Somebody needs something, there\u2019s a solution out there, but they don\u2019t have the money or the time\u2014how can we quickly put it in a box and send it to them? People who attended my workshops didn\u2019t have to spend money on materials or waste time at the store. They\u2019d watch the video and assemble it.</p><p>But then there were people who said, \u201cI do not have even five minutes in the school day to stop what I\u2019m doing to make something.\u201d So we found volunteers who said, \u201cHey, I can make slant boards. I can make switches. I can adapt toys.\u201d You have people who want to build stuff and people who need stuff. If you can deal with the time and money issue, anything\u2019s possible to serve more people and provide more devices.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s your biggest vision for the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm:</strong> I\u2019m very passionate about communication. December 15th was the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passage in 1791 of our First Amendment</a>, freedom of speech. Yet people with communication impairments are denied their basic right of freedom of speech because they don\u2019t have an affordable communication device, or it takes too long to program or learn. I just wish we could get better at designing and fabricating affordable communication devices, so everybody is awarded their First Amendment right. It shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s nice to have\u2014it\u2019s something that\u2019s needed to have. When you lose your leg, you\u2019re fitted with a prosthetic device, and insurance covers that. Insurance should also cover communication devices and all the support services needed. With voice recognition and computer-generated voices, there are tremendous opportunities in assistive technology for communication impairments that need to be addressed.</p><p><strong>What should </strong><em><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></strong></em><strong> readers take away from this conversation?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm: </strong>There\u2019s tremendous need for this skill set\u2014working in conjunction with AI and material sciences and the field of assistive technology and rehab engineering. I\u2019d like people to look at opportunities to volunteer their time and also to pursue careers in the field of specialized rehab engineering.</p><p><strong>How are DIY approaches evolving with new technologies?</strong></p><p><strong>Wilkomm:</strong> What we\u2019re seeing at maker fairs is more people doing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printed-rockets-india-agnikul\" target=\"_blank\">3D printing</a>, switch-access controls, and these five-minute approaches. There has to be a healthy balance between what we can do with or without electronics. If we need something programmed with electronics, absolutely\u2014but is there a faster way?</p><p>The other thing that\u2019s interesting is skill development. You used to have to go to college for four, six, eight years. With YouTube, you can learn so much on the internet. You can develop skills in things you never thought were possible without a four-year degree. There\u2019s basic electronic stuff you can absolutely learn without taking a course. I think we\u2019re going to have more people out there doing hacks, asking \u201cWhat if I change it this way?\u201d We don\u2019t need to have a switch. </p><p>We need to look at the person\u2019s body and how that body interacts with the electronic device interface so it requires minimal effort\u2014whether it be eye control or motion control. Having devices that predict what you\u2019re going to want next, that are constantly listening, knowing the way you talk. I love the fact that AI looks at all my emails and creates this whole thing like \u201chere\u2019s how I\u2019d respond.\u201d I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s exactly it. I just hit select and I don\u2019t have to type it all out. It speeds up communication. We\u2019re living in exciting times right now.</p>"

Superpressure balloons can last for months and travel long distances, potentially circumnavigating the globe, all the while reporting their position.</p><p>You might imagine that an undertaking like this would be immensely difficult and cost thousands of dollars. In fact, you can build and launch such a balloon for about the cost of a fancy dinner out. You just have to think small! That\u2019s why amateur balloonists call them pico balloons.</p><p>The payload of a pico balloon is so light (between 12 to 30 grams) that you can use a large Mylar party balloon filled with helium to lift it. They\u2019re also inexpensive; that\u2019s important because you won\u2019t get your payload back. And because such diminutive payloads don\u2019t pose a danger to aircraft, they aren\u2019t subject to the many rules and restrictions on free-floating balloons that carry more mass.</p><p>The essential advances that made pico ballooning possible were figuring out how to track a balloon no matter where in the world it might be and how to power such tiny payloads. A lot of folks worked on these challenges and came up with good solutions that aren\u2019t hard or expensive to reproduce.</p><h2>What is WSPR?</h2><p>Amazingly, the global tracking of the balloon\u2019s telemetry is done without satellites. Instead, pico balloonists take advantage of an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amateur-radio\" target=\"_blank\">amateur-radio</a> network called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WSPR</a> (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter), a protocol developed by a rather famous ham-radio enthusiast\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hooton_Taylor_Jr.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr</a>., one of the two scientists awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering binary pulsars.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Major components of a pico balloon payload.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"176da\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/major-components-of-a-pico-balloon-payload.png?id=63339919&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller [top left] is soldered directly to a daughterboard consisting of a high-frequency transmitter and a GPS module [bottom left], which are all powered by solar panels [right].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>WSPR was designed to monitor signal-propagation conditions for different radio bands\u2014useful information if you\u2019re a ham trying to make distant contacts. WSPR can also record low-power balloon-telemetry signals. WSPR is very low bandwidth\u2014less than 10 bits per minute\u2014but it does the job. A worldwide network of radio amateurs receives these WSPR signals and reports them publicly over the internet, which gives picoballoonists a way to track their flights. You need at least a <a href=\"https://www.arrl.org/upgrading-to-a-general-license\" target=\"_blank\">general-class</a> ham-radio license to launch a pico balloon, as one is required to transmit on the bands used for long-distance telemetry.</p><p>The pico balloon payload I chose to build is based on the aptly named US $4 <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi Pico board</a>, with a solder-on daughterboard that contains a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gps\" target=\"_blank\">GPS</a> receiver and transmitter. The folks who developed this daughterboard and associated software (to create what they call the <a href=\"https://traquito.github.io/tracker/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack WSPR Tracker</a>) have done a fantastic job of making their work easy to reproduce.</p><p>You could, in principle, power the Jetpack tracker with batteries, but in practice it would be impossible to keep them warm in the stratosphere, where average temperatures can be as low as \u201351 \u00b0C. Instead, the tracker runs off two lightweight solar modules. At night, it gracefully powers down. When the sun rises high enough in the morning, the tracker powers up and starts transmitting again.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>My first pico balloon made it only halfway across the Atlantic before going silent.</span></p><p>I had five Jetpack boards custom-manufactured in China for just $39. The cost nearly doubled after adding shipping and tariff charges. Still that\u2019s really cheap, even when you add the cost of the Raspberry Pi ($4), <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F28ZWPY6\" target=\"_blank\">the party balloon</a> ($10 for two), the helium ($10 at my local supermarket), and the two <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerFilm-MPT6-75-Module-Flexible-Thin-Film/dp/B002MFGD16\" target=\"_blank\">solar modules</a> ($7 each).</p><p>The biggest sticking point I had with the Jetpack design was the liberties it takes with spurious emissions from its transmitter. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations call for spurious emissions to be at least 43 decibels below the power of the transmitted signal. But my transmitter had strong unwanted emissions at odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency. (That\u2019s because the transmitter is a<a href=\"https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/3/e/a/9/a/Si5351-datasheet.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Si5351A</a> temperature-controlled oscillator, which outputs a square wave, not a sinusoid.) Taking measurements, I could see that the third harmonic at 42 megahertz was only 25 dB quieter than the 14-MHz fundamental of my WSPR signal\u2019s frequency. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A map showing a track from North Carolina in the United States across the Atlantic and the Iberean peninsula to the Mediterranean. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"77213\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-map-showing-a-track-from-north-carolina-in-the-united-states-across-the-atlantic-and-the-iberean-peninsula-to-the-mediterranea.png?id=63339932&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">As of press time, the WSPR network had tracked my balloon from the Eastern United States to the Mediterranean coast. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>In practical terms, this shouldn\u2019t create any noticeable interference, given that this transmitter puts out milliwatts at most and floats miles away from the nearest receiver. Still, I wanted to be fully compliant with FCC regulations, so I added traps to the antenna\u2014simple circuit elements that hams use to allow a single antenna to work on multiple bands by altering how the antenna resonates at different frequencies. Each trap was made of a small inductor (four 5-millimeter-diameter loops of No. 32 magnet wire) in parallel with a 220-picofarad capacitor. I tuned them with the help of a <a href=\"https://nanovna.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NanoVNA</a> signal analyzer by stretching the loops apart slightly. I attached the traps directly to the tracker board, so that they quashed the spurious 42-MHz emissions at the source. That worked well and added only 0.3 grams of weight.</p><p>With my payload complete, I partially filled my balloon with helium. You want the balloon to hold just a little more gas than it takes to lift the payload off the ground. This will give the helium room to expand as the balloon climbs to its final altitude.</p><p>My first pico balloon, launched from a park near my home in North Carolina, made it only halfway across the Atlantic before going silent. My second went up and was never heard from again. The third was indeed the charm. It crossed the Iberian Peninsula and at the time of this writing is somewhere over the Mediterranean at an altitude of nearly 12 kilometers. With any luck, <a href=\"https://traquito.github.io/search/spots/dashboard/?band=20m&amp;channel=104&amp;callsign=N4LVD&amp;dtGte=2026-01-01\" target=\"_blank\">it might go on</a> to orbit the planet.</p><p>I\u2019m a little puzzled about the balloons\u2019 telemetry messages received on the WSPR network, as they have been few and far between. My best guess is that power from the horizontal solar panels I\u2019m using is marginal, with the winter sun being so low in the sky. That\u2019s something I should have thought about before launching the first balloon just 24 hours after the winter solstice!</p><p><em>This article appears in the February 2026 print issue as \u201c<span>Long-Duration Amateur Ballooning</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

The same institution founded on the principle of easy and open community collaboration could now be proving unmovable\u2014trapped between the need to adapt and an institutional resistance to change.</span></p><h3>Wikipedia\u2019s Digital Sclerosis</h3><p>Political economist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom\" target=\"_blank\">Elinor Ostrom</a> won the 2009 Nobel Prize in economics for <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/governingcommons0000ostr/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">studying the ways communities successfully manage shared resources</a>\u2014the \u201ccommons.\u201d Wikipedia\u2019s two founders (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy Wales</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Sanger</a>) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">established the internet\u2019s open-source encyclopedia</a> 25 years ago on principles of the commons: its volunteer editors create and enforce policies, resolve disputes, and shape the encyclopedia\u2019s direction.</p><p>But building around the commons contains a trade-off, Ostrom\u2019s work found. Communities that make collective decisions tend to develop strong institutional identities. And those identities sometimes spawn reflexively conservative impulses.</p><p>Giving users agency over Wikipedia\u2019s rules, as I\u2019ve discovered in some of <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301663933_Wikimedia_movement_governance_the_limits_of_a-hierarchical_organization\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my own studies of Wikipedia</a>, can lead an institution away ultimately from the needs of those the institution serves.</p><p>Wikipedia\u2019s editors have built the largest collaborative knowledge project in human history. But the governance these editors exercise increasingly resists new generations of innovation.</p><p>Paradoxically, Wikipedia\u2019s revolutionarily collaborative structure once put it at the vanguard of innovation on the open internet. But now that same structure may be failing newer generations of readers.</p><h3>Does Wikipedia\u2019s Format Belong to Readers or Editors?</h3><p>There\u2019s a generational disconnect today at the heart of Wikipedia\u2019s current struggles. The encyclopedia\u2019s format remains wedded to the information-dense, text-heavy style of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica\" target=\"_blank\">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>\u2014the very model Wikipedia was designed to replace.</p><p>A Britannica replacement made sense in 2001. One-quarter of a century ago, the average internet user was older and accustomed to reading long-form content.</p><p>However, teens and twentysomethings today are of a very different demographic and have markedly different media consumption habits compared to Wikipedia\u2019s forebears. <a href=\"https://www.gwi.com/blog/gen-z-vs-gen-alpha\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Z and Gen Alpha</a> readers are accustomed to TikTok, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-youtube-era-made-cloud-gaming-possible\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>, and mobile-first visual media. Their impatience for Wikipedia\u2019s impenetrable walls of text, as any parent of kids of this age knows, arguably threatens the future of the internet\u2019s collaborative knowledge clearinghouse.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation knows this, too. <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/11/10/in-the-ai-era-wikipedia-has-never-been-more-valuable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Research has shown</a> that many readers today greatly value quick overviews of any article, before the reader considers whether to dive into the article\u2019s full text. </p><p>So last June, the Foundation launched a modest experiment they called \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_Wikimedia_projects#Beginnings_of_generative_AI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Article Summaries</a>.\u201d The summaries consisted of AI-generated, simplified text at the top of complex articles. Summaries were clearly labeled as machine-generated and unverified, and they were available only to mobile users who opted in.</p><p>Even after all these precautions, however, the volunteer editor community barely gave the experiment time to begin. Editors shut down Simple Article Summaries within <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-pilot-after-editors-protest/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a day</a> of its launch.</p><p>The response was fierce. Editors called the experiment a \u201cghastly idea\u201d and warned of \u201cimmediate and irreversible harm\u201d to Wikipedia\u2019s credibility.</p><p>Comments in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_221\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">village pump</a> (a community discussion page) ranged from blunt (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-summaries-after-editor-revolt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yuck</a>\u201c) to alarmed, with contributors raising <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">legitimate concerns</a> about AI hallucinations and the erosion of editorial oversight.</p><h3>Revisiting Wikipedia\u2019s Past Helps Reveal Its Future</h3><p>Last year\u2019s Simple Summaries storm, and sudden silencing, should be considered in light of historical context. Consider three other flashpoints from Wikipedia\u2019s past:</p><p>In 2013, the Foundation launched VisualEditor\u2014a \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d interface meant to make editing easier\u2014as the default for all newcomers. However, the interface often crashed, broke articles, and was so slow that experienced editors fled. After <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor/RFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">protests erupted</a>, a Wikipedia administrator <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2013/09/25/wikipedia_peasants_revolt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">overrode</a> the Foundation\u2019s rollout, returning VisualEditor to an opt-in feature.</p><p>The following year brought <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_Viewer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Media Viewer</a>, which changed how images displayed. The community voted to disable it. Then, when an administrator implemented that consensus, a Foundation executive reversed the change and threatened to revoke the admin\u2019s privileges. On the German Wikipedia, the Foundation deployed a new \u201csuperprotect\u201d user right to prevent the community from turning Media Viewer off.</p><p>Even proposals that technically won majority support met resistance. In 2011, the Foundation held a referendum on an image filter that would let readers voluntarily hide graphic content. Despite <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_filter_referendum/Sue's_report_to_the_board/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">56 percent support</a>, the feature was shelved after the German Wikipedia community voted 86 percent against it.</p><p>These three controversies from Wikipedia\u2019s past reveals how genuine conversations can achieve\u2014after disagreements and controversy\u2014compromise and evolution of Wikipedia\u2019s features and formats. Reflexive vetoes of new experiments, as the Simple Summaries spat highlighted last summer, is not genuine conversation.</p><p>Supplementing Wikipedia\u2019s Encyclopedia Britannica-style format with a small component that contains AI summaries is not a simple problem with a cut-and-dry answer. Though neither were VisualEditor or Media Viewer.</p><p>Why did 2025\u2019s Wikipedia crisis result in immediate clampdown, whereas its internal crises between 2011-\u201914 found more community-based debates involving discussions and plebiscites? Is Wikipedia\u2019s global readership today witnessing the first signs of a dangerous generation gap ?</p><h3>Wikipedia Needs to Air Its Sustainability Crisis</h3><p>A still deeper crisis haunts the online encyclopedia: the sustainability of unpaid labor. Wikipedia was built by volunteers who found meaning in collective knowledge creation. That model worked brilliantly when a generation of internet enthusiasts had time, energy, and idealism to spare. But the volunteer base is aging. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2010 study</a> found the average Wikipedia contributor was in their mid-20s; today, many of those same editors are now in their forties or fifties.</p><p>Meanwhile, the tech industry has discovered how to extract billions in value from their work. AI companies train their large language models on Wikipedia\u2019s corpus. The <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2025/11/10/in-the-ai-era-wikipedia-has-never-been-more-valuable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Foundation recently noted</a> it remains one of the highest-quality datasets in the world for AI development. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Research confirms</a> that when developers try to omit Wikipedia from training data, their models produce answers that are less accurate, less diverse, and less verifiable.</p><p>The irony is stark. AI systems deliver answers derived from Wikipedia without sending users back to the source. Google\u2019s AI Overviews, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-checking-sucks\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a>, and countless other tools have learned from Wikipedia\u2019s volunteer-created content\u2014then present that knowledge in ways that break the virtuous cycle Wikipedia depends on. Fewer readers visit the encyclopedia directly. Fewer visitors become editors. Fewer users donate. The pipeline that sustained Wikipedia for a quarter century is breaking down.</p><h3>What Does Wikipedia\u2019s Next 25 Years Look Like?</h3><p>The Simple Summaries situation arguably risks making the encyclopedia increasingly irrelevant to younger generations of readers. And they\u2019ll be relying on Wikipedia\u2019s information commons for the longest timeframe of any cohort now editing or reading it.</p><p>On the other hand, a larger mandate does of course remain at Wikipedia to serve as stewards of the information commons. And wrongly implementing Simple Summaries could fail this ambitious objective. Which would be terrible, too. </p><p>All of which, frankly, are what open discussions and sometimes-messy referenda are all about: Not just sudden shutdowns.</p><p>Meanwhile, AI systems should credit Wikipedia when drawing on its content, maintaining the transparency that builds public trust. Companies profiting from Wikipedia\u2019s corpus should pay for access through legitimate channels like Wikimedia Enterprise, rather than scraping servers or relying on data dumps that strain infrastructure without contributing to maintenance.</p><p>Perhaps as the AI marketplace matures, there could be room for new large language models trained exclusively on trustworthy Wikimedia data\u2014transparent, verifiable, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14292\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free from the pollution of synthetic AI-generated content</a>. Perhaps, too, Creative Commons licenses need <a href=\"https://www.jipitec.eu/jipitec/article/view/415\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updating to account for AI-era realities</a>.</p><p>Perhaps Wikipedia itself needs new modalities for creating and sharing knowledge\u2014ones that preserve editorial rigor while meeting audiences where they are.</p><p>Wikipedia has survived edit wars, vandalism campaigns, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_of_the_end_of_Wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">countless predictions of its demise</a>. It has patiently outlived the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/12/giz139/5651107\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skeptics who dismissed it as unreliable</a>. It has proven that strangers can collaborate to build something remarkable.</p><p>But Wikipedia cannot survive by refusing to change. Ostrom\u2019s Nobel prize-winning research reminds us that the communities that govern shared resources often grow conservative over time.</p><p>For anyone who cares about the future of reliable information online, Wikipedia\u2019s 25th anniversary is not just a celebration. It is an urgent warning about what happens when the institutions we depend on cannot adapt to the people they are meant to serve.</p><p><em>Dariusz Jemielniak is Vice President of the <a href=\"https://pan.pl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Polish Academy of Sciences</a>, a Full Professor at <a href=\"https://www.kozminski.edu.pl/en\" target=\"_blank\">Kozminski University</a> in Warsaw, and a faculty associate at the <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard University.

On day one of his second term as U.S. president, Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>executive order</span></a> listing which energy resources his country should promote.

The cost concerns stem from estimates that electricity use in the United States is projected to increase 32 percent by 2030,  mostly from data centers, according to the latest <a href=\"https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Strategies-National-Load-Growth-Report-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>forecast</span></a> from Grid Strategies.</p><p>The solar and storage industries are welcoming these demand projections.

But clean energy isn\u2019t completely missing from Fervo\u2019s communications. \u201cSome sides of the aisle like parts of it, and other parts of the aisle like other parts of it,\u201d Jewett says.</p><p>Like geothermal, nuclear power has enjoyed support from both political parties in the United States. It too is now focusing on touting its ability to meet rising electricity demand, albeit through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/three-mile-island\" target=\"_self\"><span>restarting of decommissioned reactors</span></a>, the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\" target=\"_self\"><span>building of massive new plants</span></a>, and experimentation with advanced solutions such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states\" target=\"_self\"><span>small modular reactors</span></a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/microreactor\" target=\"_self\"><span>microreactors</span></a>.</p><h2> Countries Adopt \u2018Energy Addition\u2019 Tack</h2><p>It\u2019s not just U.S. companies that are shifting the message.

We used other tax incentives to encourage building charging stations on highways and in rural areas. Cities had the opportunity to exempt zero-emissions cars from toll roads. EV drivers also got reduced ferry fares, free parking, and access to bus lanes in many cities. The technology for the vehicles wasn\u2019t that good at the start of the incentives program, but we had the taxes and incentives to make traditional passenger cars more expensive.</p><p><strong>What were the biggest barriers, and how did policymakers overcome them?</strong></p><p><strong>Kroglund:</strong> Early on the technology was challenging. In summertime it was easy to fuel the EV, but in wintertime it\u2019s double the use of energy. But the technology has improved a lot in the last five years.</p><p>The Norwegian tax exemptions on EVs were introduced before EVs came to market and were decisive in offsetting the early disadvantages of EVs compared to conventional cars, especially regarding comfort, vehicle size, and range. The rapid expansion of charging infrastructure along major corridors has also been important to overcome range anxiety.</p><p><strong>How have private companies responded to government incentives?</strong></p><p><strong>Kroglund:</strong> I\u2019m personally surprised that it went so well. This was a long-term commitment from the government, and the market has responded to that. Many Norwegian companies use EVs. The market for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-charging-2671242103\" target=\"_blank\">charging infrastructure</a> is considered commercially viable and no longer needs financial support. However, we don\u2019t see commercial-vehicle adoption going as fast as passenger vehicles, and we had the same goal. So we will have to review the goals, and we\u2019ll have to review the incentives.</p><p><strong>What unexpected new problems is Norway\u2019s success creating?</strong></p><p><strong>Kroglund:</strong> The success of the passenger-vehicle policies mean EVs are in competition with public transport in the larger cities. Driving an EV remains much cheaper than driving a conventional car even without tax exemptions, and overall car use continues to rise. National, regional, and local governments must find different tools to promote walking, bicycling, and public transport because each city and region is different.</p><p><strong>How applicable are these lessons to poorer or less well-administered countries and why?</strong></p><p><strong>Kroglund:</strong> We are different as countries. The geographies are different, and some countries have even bigger cities than our national population. This is not a policy for L.A., but what we see in Norway is that incentives work. However, tax incentives are only applicable in systems where effective taxation is established, which may not be the case in poorer countries. Other benefits, such as lower local emissions, only apply in places with lots of traffic.</p><p>The Norwegian experience shows that the economic incentives work, but it also shows that EVs work even in a country with cold weather.</p><p><em>This article appears in the February 2026 print issue as \u201cCecilie Knibe Kroglund.\u201d</em></p>"

In districts such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhemaji\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dhemaji</a>, Assam, and the rural areas of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharagpur\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kharagpur</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">West Bengal</a>, learning STEM often is just a distant dream.</p><p>I grew up in rural areas, and I saw how curiosity for science collided with poverty. Many students\u2019 futures rely entirely on getting good grades to determine whether they are \u201cworthy\u201d of studying technical subjects later. One low grade on an exam can completely derail their future. More importantly, the absence of fully equipped laboratories, trained mentors, or exposure to STEM careers prevents many children from even being able to imagine an engineering career.</p><p>This is not just an educational issue. It is a matter of equity, directly aligned with <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 4</a>, which aims to ensure a quality education for everyone.</p><p>The challenge is one that organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a>, with its global technical community, are positioned to address. As technology becomes more imperative for everyday life, proficiency in electronics and programming is no longer optional\u2014it is essential.</p><h2>STEM outreach programs</h2><p>In December 2020 volunteers from the joint student chapter of the <a href=\"https://edu.ieee.org/in-iitkgp-mtt/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Antennas and Propagation\u2013Microwave Theory and Techniques</a> (IEEE AP-MTT) societies at the <a href=\"https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a> launched a grassroots STEM outreach <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9423752\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initiative</a> with support from the <a href=\"https://ieeekharagpur.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Kharagpur Section</a>.</p><p>I coordinated the initiative, which started when I was secretary of the student chapter. (I also was its vice chair and chair from 2020 to 2022.) Today I am a student ambassador for the IEEE MTT Society and the <a href=\"https://yp.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Young Professionals</a> cochair of the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ieee-benelux-mtt-ap-joint-chapter/?originalSubdomain=nl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Benelux MTT-AP joint chapter</a>.</p><p>The program\u2019s mission was simple: make hands-on electronics accessible to students who had never seen an <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Arduino</a> board.</p><p>It began with training in the fundamentals of circuit building\u2014LEDs, switches, breadboards, and batteries\u2014and progressed into Arduino programming, automation, and sensor integration. The volunteers emphasized teamwork and friendly competitions to keep students engaged.</p><p>Through straightforward, relatable demonstrations, even complex topics such as electromagnetic concepts were explained in ways that the students could understand. The methodology not only increased understanding; it also sparked enthusiasm. In the first year, nearly 100 students from five schools benefited from the curriculum. The model is now known as Teach, Train, and Build (TTB). The initiative was recognized in 2021 with the <a href=\"https://students.ieee.org/the-darrel-chong-student-activity-award/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Darrel Chong Student Activity Award</a>.</p><h2>The birth of hobby clubs</h2><p>TTB\u2019s success led to additional funding from the <a href=\"https://sight.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Special Interest Group in Humanitarian Technology</a> (SIGHT) program in 2022<strong>. </strong>This support from IEEE SIGHT enabled the establishment of<strong> </strong>three electronics hobby labs in underserved schools in Assam and West Bengal. The E-HuTS (electronic hobby clubs for technical development in rural schools) labs became permanent areas where students learn, experiment, and innovate.</p><p>The inauguration ceremony for the E-HuTS was a milestone moment. To further inspire students, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrinal-mandal-96a97137/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mrinal Mandal</a>, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at IIT Kharagpur, gave a motivational talk in Bengali. The immediate outcome was that a group of students built a smart home using Arduino and wireless communication modules\u2014something they never imagined they could do.</p><h2>Reducing gender disparity</h2><p>A similar transformation unfolded in Assam, where the TTB program was conducted entirely in the Assamese language, ensuring inclusivity for students with limited exposure to English. After completing the program, students proudly displayed their IEEE certificates.</p><p>One of the best aspects of the Assam program was the overwhelming participation of female students. Many of the young women were interacting with electronics for the first time\u2014an inspiring step toward reducing gender disparity in the STEM field.</p><h2>Real impact: projects, confidence, and recognition</h2><p>The more than 85 students who joined the hobby clubs in Assam and West Bengal developed almost three dozen projects including sensor-based alarms and environmental monitoring systems. The innovations weren\u2019t replicas; they were original student-driven designs developed under the guidance of an IEEE mentor.</p><p>The initiative received a mention in the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/corporate-communications/annual-report/2022/2022-ieee-annual-final-print-version.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2022 IEEE annual report</a> and in an article in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>The Institute</em></em></a> about<strong> </strong>the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-education-week-2022-overview\" target=\"_self\">2022<strong> </strong>IEEE Education Week</a> activities.</p><p>To ensure measurable progress of the program, the TTB team also implemented an evaluation matrix inspired by <a href=\"https://ieeeht.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Humanitarian Technologies Board</a> guidelines. The spreadsheet tracked outputs including the number of workshops held, hours delivered, and tools provided. It also measured results such as skills development, knowledge retention, student engagement, and long-term interest.</p><p>The structured methodology made the project replicable and transparent, providing a framework for future STEM outreach efforts.</p><h2>New chapters, new beginnings</h2><p>The momentum from those initiatives helped spark the creation of IEEE communities in India. In 2023 the IEEE student branch at <a href=\"https://dibru.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dibrugarh University</a> in Assam was formed, followed in 2024 by the university\u2019s <a href=\"https://edu.ieee.org/in-dibru/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Microwave Theory and Technology Society student branch chapter</a>. The groups have become centers of volunteer activity, ensuring long-term sustainability.</p><p>This year the TTB team organized<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGStCkIT2Tn/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TechnoFest: Udhvav 2.0</a><strong>,</strong> which brought engineers, scientists, lecturers, and members of the <a href=\"https://yp.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Young Professionals</a> group together with students in the region. For many participants, it was their first opportunity to interact with real innovators and role models, turning the festival into an energizing platform of inspiration and exposure for rural youth.</p><h2>A visit to Vidhya: The Living School</h2><p>Also in 2023, thanks to a grant from the <a href=\"https://mtt.org/ieee-mtt-s-ambassador-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE MTT-S Ambassador</a> program, IEEE volunteers visited <a href=\"https://vidyalivingschool.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vidhya: The Living School</a>, in Dhemaji. The session took place outdoors that October amid breathtaking natural landscapes, demonstrating that learning thrives even outside of a traditional infrastructure.</p><p>Another important milestone came in 2024, when the <a href=\"https://mtt.org/humanitarian-initiatives-sight/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE MTT-S SIGHT group</a> provided a grant of US $1,000 to the school for its <a href=\"https://edu.ieee.org/in-dibru/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vidhya Shakti project</a> to install solar panels to provide uninterrupted and sustainable power to the school.</p><p>The student ambassadors met several distinguished figures who have made notable contributions to STEM education in India. They included <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/pranjalburagohain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pranjal Buragohain</a>, founder of the Vidhya school; chemical scientist <a href=\"https://neist.res.in/1177.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Binoy Kumar Saikia</a>, a recipient of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanti_Swarup_Bhatnagar_Prize_for_Science_and_Technology\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award for Science and Technology</a> in India; and astronomer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishor-baruah-69746414a/?originalSubdomain=in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kishor Baruah</a>, known for creating programs for visually impaired students.</p><p>Another heartwarming stop was at the Tai Phake School near <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naharkatiya\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Naharkatya</a>, where one of the first E-HuTS labs was established in 2022.</p><p>The initiative has grown far beyond its original mission. It now: </p><ul><li>Connects universities with remote schools.</li><li>Empowers underprivileged students.</li><li>Nurtures future IEEE volunteers.</li><li>Reduces gender barriers.</li><li>Creates sustainable technical ecosystems.</li><li>Builds a culture of giving back.</li></ul><p>What began with a few breadboards and LEDs is now shaping the future of budding engineers across India. More than 100 students have been affected, dozens of projects have been built, and schools now have functioning electronics labs. New IEEE student branches have sprung to life, and communities once isolated from STEM education are becoming part of the growing technological landscape.</p><p>The journey continues, driven by connection, compassion, and the belief that every student, no matter where they live, deserves access to quality STEM education.</p>"

Instead of speakers, the Project G had sound globes.

As one writer later put it, it was more like a concept car \u201cintended to give Clairtone an aura of futuristic cool.\u201d Eventually fewer than 500 were made. But the Project G still became an icon of mod \u201960s Canadian design, winning a silver medal at the 13th Milan Triennale, the international design exhibition.</p><p>And then it was over; the dream had ended. Eleven years after its founding, Clairtone collapsed, and Munk and cofounder David Gilmour lost control of the company.</p><h2>The birth of Clairtone Sound Corp.</h2><p>Clairtone\u2019s Peter Munk lived a colorful life, with a nightmarish start and many fantastic and dreamlike parts too. He was born in 1927 in Budapest to a prosperous Jewish family. In the spring of 1944, Munk and 13 members of his family boarded a train with more than 1,600 Jews bound for the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. They arrived, but after some weeks the train moved on, eventually reaching neutral Switzerland. It later emerged that the Nazis had extorted large sums of cash and valuables from the occupants in exchange for letting the train proceed.</p><p>As a teenager in Switzerland, Munk was a self-described party animal. He enjoyed dancing and dating and going on long ski trips with friends. Schoolwork was not a top priority, and he didn\u2019t have the grades to attend a Swiss university. His mother, an Auschwitz survivor, encouraged him to study in Canada, where he had an uncle.</p><p>Before he could enroll, though, Munk blew his tuition money entertaining a young woman during a trip to New York. He then found work picking tobacco, earned enough for tuition, and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1952 with a degree in electrical engineering.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of two men in office attire. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1c5ae\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-two-men-in-office-attire.jpg?id=62980489&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Clairtone cofounders Peter Munk [left] and David Gilmour envisioned the company as a luxury brand.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nina Munk/The Peter Munk Estate</small></p><p>At the age of 30, Munk was making custom hi-fi sets for wealthy clients when he and David Gilmour, who owned a small business importing Scandinavian goods, decided to join forces. Their idea was to create high-fidelity equipment with a contemporary Scandinavian design. Munk\u2019s father-in-law, William Jay Gutterson, invested $3,000. Gilmour mortgaged his house. In 1958, Clairtone Sound Corp. was born. </p><p>From the beginning, Munk and Gilmour sought a high-end clientele. They positioned Clairtone as a luxury brand, part of an elegant lifestyle. If you were the type of woman who listened to music while wearing pearls and a strapless gown and lounging on a shag rug, your music would be playing on a Clairtone. If you were a man who dressed smartly and owned an <a href=\"https://arnejacobsen.com/works/the-egg-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Arne Jacobsen Egg chair</a>, you would also be listening on a Clairtone. That was the modern lifestyle captured in the company\u2019s advertisements. </p><p>In 1958, Clairtone produced its first prototype: the monophonic 100-M, which had a long, low cabinet made from oiled teak, with a Dual 1004 turntable, a Granco tube chassis, and a pair of Coral speakers. It never went into production, but the next model, the stereophonic 100-S, won a Design Award from Canada\u2019s National Industrial Design Council in 1959. By 1963, Clairtone was selling 25,000 units a year.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a line of stereo components under assembly, with a man in a lab coat at one end and a man in a suit at the other.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"90768\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-line-of-stereo-components-under-assembly-with-a-man-in-a-lab-coat-at-one-end-and-a-man-in-a-suit-at.jpg?id=62981917&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Peter Munk visits the Project G assembly line in 1965. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nina Munk/The Peter Munk Estate</small></p><p>Design was always front and center at Clairtone, not just for the products but also for the typography, advertisements, and even the annual reports. Yet nothing in the early designs signaled the dramatic turn it would take with the Project G. That came about because of Hugh Spencer.</p><p>Spencer was not an engineer, nor did he have experience designing consumer electronics. His day job was designing sets for the <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Broadcast Corp.</a> He consulted regularly with Clairtone on the company\u2019s graphics and signage. The only stereo he ever designed for Clairtone was the Project G, which he first modeled as a wooden box with tennis balls stuck to the sides. </p><p>From both design and quality perspectives, Clairtone was successful. But the company was almost always hemorrhaging cash. In 1966, with great fanfare and large government incentives, the company opened a state-of-the-art production facility in Nova Scotia. It was a mismatch. The local workforce didn\u2019t have the necessary skills, and the surrounding infrastructure couldn\u2019t handle the production. On 27 August 1967, Munk and Gilmour were forced out of Clairtone, which became the property of the government of Nova Scotia.</p><p>Despite the demise of their first company (and the government inquiry that followed), Munk and Gilmour remained friends and went on to become serial entrepreneurs. Their next venture? A resort in Fiji, which became part of a large hotel chain in that country, Australia, and New Zealand. (Gilmour later founded <a href=\"https://www.fijiwater.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fiji Water</a>.) Then Munk and Gilmour bought a gold mine and cofounded Barrick Gold (now <a href=\"https://www.barrick.com/English/home/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Barrick Mining Corp.</a>, one of the largest gold mining operations in the world). Their businesses all had ups and downs, but both men became extremely wealthy and noted philanthropists.</p><h2>Preserving Canadian design</h2><p>As an example of iconic design, the Project G seems like an ideal specimen for museum collections. And in 1991, Frank Davies, one of the designers who worked for Clairtone, donated a Project G to the recently launched Design Exchange in Toronto.

Their current answer: 5.5 days. </p><p>The CRASH Clock metric was introduced in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09643\" target=\"_blank\">paper originally published on the Arxiv physics preprint server</a> in December and is currently under consideration for publication. The team\u2019s research measures how quickly a catastrophic collision could occur if satellite operators lost the ability to maneuver\u2014whether due to a solar storm, a software failure, or some other catastrophic failure.</p><p>To be clear, say the CRASH Clock scientists, low Earth orbit is not about to become a new unstable realm of collisions. But what the researchers have shown, consistent with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/kessler-syndrome-space-debris\" target=\"_blank\">recent research and public outcry</a>, is that low Earth orbit\u2019s current stability demands perfect decisions on the part of a range of satellite operators around the globe every day. A few mistakes at the wrong time and place in orbit could set a lot of chaos in motion.</p><p>But the biggest hidden threat isn\u2019t always debris that can be seen from the ground or via radar imaging systems. <span>Rather, thousands of small pieces of junk that are still big enough to disrupt a satellite\u2019s operations are what satellite operators have nightmares about these days</span><span>. Making matters worse is SpaceX essentially locking up one of the most valuable altitudes with their <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-cellphone-starlink\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink</a> satellite megaconstellation, forcing <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/23/2025/chinese-and-starlink-satellites-nearly-collide-in-space\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese competitors to fly higher through clouds of old collision debris</a> left over from earlier accidents.</span></p><p><span><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> spoke with astrophysicists <a href=\"https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/sarah-thiele\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Thiele</a> (graduate student at <a href=\"https://web.astro.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Princeton University</a>), <a href=\"https://phas.ubc.ca/users/aaron-boley\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Boley</a> (professor of physics and astronomy at the <a href=\"https://phas.ubc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">University of British Columbia</a>, in Vancouver, Canada), and <a href=\"https://campioncollege.ca/resources/dr-samantha-lawler/\" target=\"_blank\">Samantha Lawler</a> (associate professor of astronomy at the <a href=\"https://www.uregina.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Regina</a>, in Saskatchewan, Canada) about their new paper, and about how close satellites actually are to one another, why you can\u2019t see most space junk, and what happens to the power grid when everything in orbit fails at once.</span></p><p><strong>Does the CRASH Clock measure Kessler syndrome, or something different?</strong></p><p><strong>Sarah Thiele:</strong> A lot of people are claiming we\u2019re saying Kessler syndrome is days away, and that\u2019s not what our work is saying. We\u2019re not making any claim about this being a runaway collisional cascade. We only look at the timescale to the first collision\u2014we don\u2019t simulate secondary or tertiary collisions. The CRASH Clock reflects how reliant we are on errorless operations and is an indicator for stress on the orbital environment.</p><p><strong>Aaron Boley:</strong> A lot of people\u2019s mental vision of Kessler syndrome is this very rapid runaway, and in reality this is something that can take decades to truly build.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> <a href=\"https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/sdc9/paper/305/SDC9-paper305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recent papers</a> found that altitudes between 520 and 1,000 kilometers have already reached this potential runaway threshold. Even in that case, the timescales for how slowly this happens are very long. It\u2019s more about whether you have a significant number of objects at a given altitude such that controlling the proliferation of debris becomes difficult.</p><h2>Understanding the CRASH Clock\u2019s Implications</h2><p><strong>What does the CRASH Clock approaching zero actually mean?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> The CRASH Clock assumes no maneuvers can happen\u2014a worst-case scenario where some catastrophic event like a solar storm has occurred. A zero value would mean if you lose maneuvering capabilities, you\u2019re likely to have a collision right away. It\u2019s possible to reach saturation where any maneuver triggers another maneuver, and you have this endless swarm of maneuvers where dodging doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.</p><p><strong>Boley:</strong> I think about the CRASH Clock as an evaluation of stress on orbit. As you approach zero, there\u2019s very little tolerance for error. If you have an accidental explosion\u2014whether a battery exploded or debris slammed into a satellite\u2014the risk of knock-on effects is amplified. It doesn\u2019t mean a runaway, but you can have consequences that are still operationally bad. It means much higher costs\u2014both economic and environmental\u2014because companies have to replace satellites more often. Greater launches, more satellites going up and coming down. The orbital congestion, the atmospheric pollution, all of that gets amplified.</p><p><strong>Are working satellites becoming a bigger danger to each other than debris?</strong></p><p><strong>Boley:</strong> The biggest risk on orbit is the lethal non-trackable debris\u2014this middle region where you can\u2019t track it, it won\u2019t cause an explosion, but it can disable the spacecraft if hit. This population is very large compared with what we actually track. We often talk about Kessler syndrome in terms of number density, but really what\u2019s also important is the collisional area on orbit. As you increase the area through the number of active satellites, you increase the probability of interacting with smaller debris.</p><p><strong>Samantha Lawler:</strong> <a href=\"https://starlink.com/public-files/starlinkProgressReport_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink just released a conjunction report</a>\u2014they\u2019re doing one collision avoidance maneuver every two minutes on average in their megaconstellation. </p><p><strong>The orbit at 550 km altitude, in particular, is densely packed with Starlink satellites. Is that right?</strong></p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> The way Starlink has occupied 550 km and filled it to very high density means anybody who wants to use a higher-altitude orbit has to get through that really dense shell. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-internet\" target=\"_blank\">China\u2019s megaconstellations</a> are all at higher altitudes, so they have to go through Starlink. A couple of weeks ago, there was a <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/satellites/spacecraft-from-chinese-launch-nearly-slammed-into-starlink-satellite-spacex-says\" target=\"_blank\">headline</a> about a Starlink satellite almost hitting a Chinese rocket. These problems are happening now. Starlink <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/starlink-plans-lower-satellite-orbit-enhance-safety-2026-2026-01-01/\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a> they\u2019re moving down to 350 km, shifting satellites to even lower orbits. Really, everybody has to go through them\u2014including ISS, including astronauts.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> 550 km has the highest density of active payloads. There are other orbits of concern around 800 km\u2014the altitude of the [2007] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese anti-satellite missile test</a> and the [2009] <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100002023\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos-Iridium collision</a>. Above 600 km, atmospheric drag takes a very long time to bring objects down. Below 600 km, drag acts as a natural cleaning mechanism. In that 800 km to 900 km band, there\u2019s a lot of debris that\u2019s going to be there for centuries.</p><h2>Impact of Collisions at 550 Kilometers</h2><p><strong>What happens if there\u2019s a collision at 550 km? Would that orbit become unusable?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> No, it would not become unusable\u2014not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(2013_film)#Technical_observations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gravity</em> movie scenario</a>. Any catastrophic collision is an acute injection of debris. You would still be able to use that altitude, but your operating conditions change. You\u2019re going to do a lot more collision-avoidance maneuvers. Because it\u2019s below 600 km, that debris will come down within a handful of years. But in the meantime, you\u2019re dealing with a lot more danger, especially because that\u2019s the altitude with the highest density of Starlink satellites.</p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> I don\u2019t know how quickly Starlink can respond to new debris injections. It takes days or weeks for debris to be tracked, cataloged, and made public. I hope Starlink has access to faster services, because in the meantime that\u2019s an awful lot of risk.</p><p><strong>How do solar storms affect orbital safety?</strong></p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> Solar storms make the atmosphere puff up\u2014high-energy particles smashing into the atmosphere. Drag can change very quickly. During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms\" target=\"_blank\">May 2024 solar storm</a>, orbital uncertainties were kilometers. With things traveling 7 kilometers per second, that\u2019s terrifying. Everything is maneuvering at the same time, which adds uncertainty. You want to have margin for error, time to recover after an event that changes many orbits. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-noaa-sun-reaches-maximum-phase-in-11-year-solar-cycle/\" target=\"_blank\">We\u2019ve come off solar maximum</a>, but over the next couple of years it\u2019s very likely we\u2019ll have more really powerful solar storms.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> The risk for collision within the first few days of a solar storm is a lot higher than under normal operating conditions. Even if you can still communicate with your satellite, there\u2019s so much uncertainty in your positions when everything is moving because of atmospheric drag. When you have high density of objects, it makes the likelihood of collision a lot more prominent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graph: collision chance vs. days.

Can you explain the revision?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> We updated based on community feedback, which was excellent. The newer numbers are 164 days for 2018 and 5.5 days for 2025. The paper is submitted and will hopefully go through peer review.</p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> It\u2019s been a very interesting process putting this on Arxiv and receiving community feedback.

Sarah put a note, \u201cfeedback welcome,\u201d and we got very helpful feedback. Sometimes the internet works well. If you think 5.5 days is okay when 2.8 days was not, you missed the point of the paper.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> The paper is quite interdisciplinary.

All these different stakeholders use space for different reasons, so work that has an interdisciplinary connection can get conversations started between these different domains.</p>"

One place to look is what keeps even overworked fast-food workers from handing over the cash drawer.</span></p><h2>Human Judgment Depends on Context</h2><p><span>Our basic human defenses come in at least three types: general instincts, social learning, and situation-specific training. These work together in a layered defense.</span></p><p><span>As a social species, we have developed numerous instinctive and cultural habits that help us judge tone, motive, and risk from extremely limited information. We generally know what\u2019s normal and abnormal, when to cooperate and when to resist, and whether to take action individually or to involve others. These instincts give us an intuitive sense of risk and make us </span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08242\" target=\"_blank\"><span>especially careful</span></a> about things that have a large downside or are impossible to reverse.</p><p><span>The second layer of defense consists of the norms and trust signals that evolve in any group. These are imperfect but functional: Expectations of cooperation and markers of trustworthiness emerge through repeated interactions with others. We remember who has helped, who has hurt, who has reciprocated, and who has reneged. And emotions like sympathy, anger, guilt, and gratitude motivate each of us to </span><a href=\"https://ncase.me/trust/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>reward cooperation with cooperation</span></a> and punish defection with defection.</p><p><span>A third layer is institutional mechanisms that enable us to interact with multiple strangers every day. Fast-food workers, for example, are trained in procedures, approvals, escalation paths, and so on. </span><span>Taken together, these defenses</span><span> give</span><span> humans a </span><span>strong sense</span><span> of context. A fast-</span><span>food worker basically knows what to expect within the</span><span> job</span><span> and</span><span> how it fits into broader society.</span></p><p><span>We reason by assessing multiple layers of context: perceptual (what we see and hear), relational (who\u2019s making the request), and normative (what\u2019s appropriate within a given role or situation). We constantly navigate these layers, weighing them against each other. In some cases, the normative outweighs the perceptual\u2014for example, following workplace rules even when customers appear angry. Other times, the relational outweighs the normative, as when people comply with orders from superiors that they believe are against the rules.</span></p><p><span>Crucially, we also have an interruption reflex. If something feels \u201coff,\u201d we naturally pause the automation and reevaluate. </span><span>Our defenses are not perfect; people are fooled and manipulated all the time. But it\u2019s how we humans are able to navigate a complex world where others are constantly trying to trick us.</span></p><p><span>So let</span><span>\u2019</span><span>s return to the drive-through window. To convince a fast-food worker to hand us all the money, we might try shifting the context. Show up with a camera crew and tell them you</span><span>\u2019</span><span>re filming a commercial, claim to be the head of security doing an audit, or dress like a bank manager collecting the cash receipts for the night. But even these have only a slim chance of success. Most of us, most of the time, can smell a scam.</span></p><p><span>Con artists are astute observers of human defenses. </span><span>Successful scams</span> are often slow, undermining a mark\u2019s situational assessment, allowing the scammer to manipulate the context. This is an old story, spanning traditional <span>confidence</span> <span>games such as the</span><span> </span>Depression-era \u201cbig store\u201d cons, in which teams of scammers created entirely fake businesses to draw in victims, and modern <a href=\"https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cpig-butchering\u201d frauds</a>, where online scammers slowly build trust before going in for the kill. In these examples, scammers slowly and methodically reel in a victim using a long series of interactions through which the scammers gradually gain that victim\u2019s trust.</p><p><span>Sometimes it even works at the drive-through. One scammer in the 1990s and 2000s </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_phone_call_scam\" target=\"_blank\">targeted fast-food workers by phone</a>, claiming to be a police officer and, over the course of a long phone call, convinced managers to strip-search employees and perform other bizarre acts.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Pixel art of a fast-food restaurant with a drive-thru, burger, cup, and trees.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1134a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/pixel-art-of-a-fast-food-restaurant-with-a-drive-thru-burger-cup-and-trees.png?id=62858711&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Humans detect scams and tricks by assessing multiple layers of context. AI systems do not. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nicholas Little</small></p><h2>Why LLMs Struggle With Context and Judgment </h2><p><span>LLMs behave as if they have a notion of context, but it\u2019s different. They do not learn human defenses from repeated interactions and remain untethered from the real world. LLMs flatten multiple levels of context into text similarity. They see \u201ctokens,\u201d not hierarchies and intentions. LLMs don\u2019t reason through context, they only reference it.</span></p><p><span>While LLMs often get the details right, they can easily miss the big picture. If you prompt a chatbot with a fast-food worker scenario and ask if it should give all of its money to a customer, it will respond \u201cno.\u201d What it doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d\u2014forgive the anthropomorphizing\u2014is whether it\u2019s actually being deployed as a fast-food bot or is just a test subject following instructions for hypothetical scenarios.</span></p><p><span>This limitation is why LLMs misfire when context is sparse but also when context is overwhelming and complex; when an LLM becomes unmoored from context, it\u2019s hard to get it back. AI expert Simon Willison </span><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/12/claude-memory/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>wipes context clean</span></a> if an LLM is on the wrong track rather than continuing the conversation and trying to correct the situation.</p><p><span>There\u2019s more. LLMs are </span><a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2025/july/trent-cash-ai-overconfidence.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>overconfident</span></a> because they\u2019ve been designed to give an answer rather than express ignorance. A drive-through worker might say: <span>\u201c</span><span>I don\u2019t know if I should give you all the money\u2014let me ask my boss,\u201d whereas an LLM will just make the call. And since LLMs are designed to be </span><a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/large-language-models-just-want-to-be-liked\" target=\"_blank\"><span>pleasing</span></a><span>, they\u2019re more likely to satisfy a user\u2019s request.</span> Additionally, LLM training is oriented toward the average case and not extreme outliers, which is what\u2019s necessary for security.</p><p><span>The result is that the current generation of LLMs is far more gullible than people. They\u2019re naive and regularly fall for manipulative </span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/these-psychological-tricks-can-get-llms-to-respond-to-forbidden-prompts/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>cognitive tricks</span></a> that wouldn\u2019t fool a third-grader, such as flattery, appeals to groupthink, and a false sense of urgency. There<span>\u2019</span><span>s a </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" target=\"_blank\"><span>story</span></a> about a Taco Bell AI system that crashed when a customer ordered 18,000 cups of water. A human fast-food worker would just laugh at the customer.</p><h2>The Limits of AI Agents</h2><p><span>Prompt injection is an unsolvable problem that </span><a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/5555/01/11194053/2aB2Rf5nZ0k\" target=\"_blank\"><span>gets worse</span></a> when we give AIs tools and tell them to act independently. This is the promise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">AI agents</a>: LLMs that can use tools to perform multistep tasks after being given general instructions. Their flattening of context and identity, along with their baked-in independence and overconfidence, mean that they will repeatedly and unpredictably take actions\u2014and sometimes they will take the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/ai_browsers_prompt_injection/\" target=\"_blank\"> wrong ones</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Science doesn\u2019t know how much of the problem is inherent to the way LLMs work and how much is a result of deficiencies in the way we train them. The overconfidence and obsequiousness of LLMs are training choices. The lack of an interruption reflex is a deficiency in engineering. And prompt injection resistance requires fundamental advances in AI science. We honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to build an LLM, where trusted commands and untrusted inputs are processed through the </span><a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/llms-data-control-path-insecurity/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>same channel</span></a><span>, which is immune to prompt injection attacks.</span></p><p><span>We humans get our model of the world\u2014and our facility with overlapping contexts\u2014from the way our brains work, years of training, an enormous amount of perceptual input, and millions of years of evolution. Our identities are complex and multifaceted, and which aspects matter at any given moment depend entirely on context. A fast-food worker may normally see someone as a customer, but in</span><span> a medical emergency, that same person\u2019s </span><span>identity as a doctor is suddenly more relevant. </span></p><p><span><span>We don</span><span>\u2019t know if LLMs will gain a better ability to move between different contexts as the models get more sophisticated. But t</span>he problem of recognizing context definitely can\u2019t be reduced to the one type of reasoning that LLMs currently excel at. Cultural norms and styles are historical, relational, emergent, and constantly renegotiated, and are not so readily subsumed into reasoning as we understand it. Knowledge itself can be both logical and discursive.</span></p><p><span>The AI researcher Yann LeCunn believes that improvements will come from embedding AIs in a physical presence and </span><span>giving</span> <span>them</span> \u201c<a href=\"https://medium.com/@AnthonyLaneau/beyond-llms-charting-the-next-frontiers-of-ai-with-yann-lecun-09e84f1978f9\" target=\"_blank\"><span>world models</span></a>.<span>\u201d Perhaps this is a way to give an AI a robust yet fluid notion of a social identity, and the real-world experience that will help it lose its na\u00efvet\u00e9.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately we are probably faced with a </span><a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/5555/01/11194053/2aB2Rf5nZ0k\" target=\"_blank\"><span>security trilemma</span></a> when it comes to AI agents: fast, smart, and secure are the desired attributes, but you can only get two. At the drive-through, you want to prioritize fast and secure. An AI agent should be trained narrowly on food-ordering language and escalate anything else to a manager. Otherwise, every action becomes a coin flip. Even if it comes up heads most of the time, once in a while it<span>\u2019</span><span>s going to be tails\u2014and along with a burger and fries, the customer will get the contents of the cash drawer.</span></p>"

He was recognized for helping to shape how engineers model risk in complex, data-rich systems.</p><h3>Hoang Pham</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer</strong></p><p>Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.</p><p><strong>Job title</strong></p><p>Professor of industrial and systems engineering</p><p><strong>Member grade</strong></p><p>Life Fellow</p><p><strong>Alma maters </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Northeastern Illinois University, in Chicago; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and SUNY Buffalo.</p><p>The discipline that defines his career was forged long before equations, peer-reviewed journals, or keynote speeches. It began on an overcrowded fishing boat in 1979 when he was fleeing Vietnam after the war, when survival as one of the country\u2019s \u201cboat people\u201d depended on endurance, luck, and the fragile reliability of a vessel never meant to carry so many lives. Like thousands of others, he fled from his war-torn country after the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Fall-of-Saigon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fall of Saigon</a>, which was controlled by communist North Vietnamese forces.</p><p>To mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon in 1975, Pham and his son Hoang Jr.\u2014a Rutgers computer science graduate turned filmmaker\u2014produced <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rSqNQqxkU-o?si=e3F8yW28hLfQV-a0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Unstoppable Hope</em></em></a>, a documentary about Vietnam\u2019s boat people. The film tells the stories of a dozen refugees who, like Pham, survived perilous escapes and went on to build successful lives in the United States.</p><h2>Growing up during the Vietnam War</h2><p>Pham was born in <a href=\"https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/binh-thuan-much-more-white-sand-golden-sunshine-and-blue-sea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn</a><strong>,</strong> Vietnam. His parents had only a little formal education, having grown up in the 1930s, when schooling was rare. To support their eight children, his parents ran a factory making bricks by hand. Despite their limited means, his parents held an unshakable belief that education was the surest path to a better life.</p><p>From an early age, Pham gravitated toward mathematics. Computers were scarce, but numbers and logic came naturally to him. He imagined becoming a teacher or professor and gradually began thinking about how mathematics could be applied to practical problems\u2014how abstract reasoning might improve daily life.</p><p>His intellectual curiosity unfolded amid frequent danger. He grew up during the Vietnam War, when dodging gunfire in his province was routine. The<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/tet-offensive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 1968 Tet Offensive</a> exposed the full scale of the conflict, making it clear that violence was not an interruption to life but a condition of it.</p><p>Pham recalls that after the<a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/april-30/south-vietnam-surrenders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Communist takeover of South Vietnam</a> in 1975, conditions worsened dramatically. Families without ties to the new government, especially those who operated small businesses, found it increasingly dangerous to work, study, or apply for jobs, he says. People began vanishing. Many attempted to escape by boat, knowing the risks: imprisonment if caught or potentially death at sea.</p><h2>A successful escape</h2><p>In June 1979, at the height of Vietnam\u2019s typhoon season, Pham\u2019s mother made an agonizing decision. She placed Pham, then 18 years old, onto a small, overcrowded fishing vessel in the hope that he might reach freedom.</p><p>The boat, which was designed to carry about 100 people, departed with 275.</p><p>Pham\u2019s 12-day journey was harrowing. He was confined to the lower deck, which was packed so tightly that movement was nearly impossible. Seasickness overwhelmed many passengers, and he remembers losing consciousness shortly after departure. Food was scarce, and safe drinking water was nearly nonexistent. Violent storms battered the vessel, and pirates loomed.</p><p>\u201cEvery moment felt like a struggle against nature, fate, and internal despair,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>The boat eventually washed ashore on a remote island off the Malaysian coast. Arriving at a refugee camp offered little relief; food and clean water were scarce, disease spread rapidly, and nearly everyone\u2014including Pham\u2014contracted malaria. Death came almost nightly.</p><p>After two weeks, Malaysian authorities transferred the refugees to a transit camp, where the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a> provided basic rations. Still, the asylum seekers\u2019 futures remained uncertain. It is estimated by the U.N. <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/about-unhcr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Refugee Agency</a> that between 1975 and the early 1990s, roughly 800,000 Vietnamese people attempted to escape by boat. As many as 250,000 did not survive the harrowing journey, the agency estimates.</p><h2>Starting over with nothing</h2><p>In January 1980, at age 19, Pham learned that someone in the United States had agreed to sponsor him for entry, he says. He soon boarded an airplane for the first time and landed in Seattle.</p><p>His troubles weren\u2019t over, however. He arrived in a city blanketed by snow, wearing thin clothing and carrying only a spare shirt. The frosty weather was not his greatest concern, though. During his first two months, he spent most of his time in a hospital, recovering from malaria and other diseases. And he spoke no English.</p><p>Still, Pham\u2014who had been a first-year college student in Vietnam\u2014refused to abandon his goal of becoming a teacher, he says. He enrolled at<a href=\"https://lincolnhs.seattleschools.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Lincoln High School</a> in order to gain English proficiency and position himself to enter an American college. One teacher allowed him to test into a calculus class despite his limited English\u2014which he passed.</p><p>\u201cThat moment told me I could survive here,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>Within months, he learned he could attend college on a scholarship. He moved to Chicago in August 1980 to study at the<a href=\"https://nl.edu/national-college-of-education/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> National College of Education</a>, then he transferred to<a href=\"https://www.neiu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Northeastern Illinois University</a>, also in Chicago, earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and computer science in 1982.</p><p>Encouraged by mentors, he earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics at the<a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Illinois</a> at Urbana-Champaign in 1984, followed by a Ph.D. in reliability engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.buffalo.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">State University of New York at Buffalo</a> in 1989.</p><h2>When failure is not an option</h2><p>Pham\u2019s research direction crystallized in 1988 while searching for a dissertation topic. He was reading the January 1988 issue of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"> <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a> and had a flash of inspiration after seeing a classified ad posted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Defense Department</a>\u2019s Naval Underwater System Center (now known as the <a href=\"https://tethys.pnnl.gov/organization/naval-undersea-warfare-center-nuwc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Naval Undersea Warfare Center</a>). The ad asked, \u201cCan your theories solve the unsolvable?\u201d It focused on the reliability of undersea communication and combat decision-making systems.</p><p>The ad revealed to him that institutions were actively applying mathematics and statistics to solve engineering problems. Pham says he still keeps a copy of that <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> issue in his office.</p><p>After completing his Ph.D., he joined<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing</a> as a senior specialist engineer at its Renton, Wash., facility, working on engine reliability for the<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/commercial/777\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 777</a> aircraft, which was under development.</p><p>He worked there for 18 months, then accepted a senior engineering specialist position at the<a href=\"https://inl.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Idaho National Laboratory</a>, in Idaho Falls, where he worked on nuclear systems.</p><p>His desire to become an instructor never left him, however. In 1993 he joined Rutgers as an assistant professor of industrial and systems engineering.</p><p>Today his research focuses on reliability in modern, data-intensive systems, including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> AI</a> infrastructure and global<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers\" target=\"_self\"> data centers</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe problem now isn\u2019t getting data,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing which data to trust.\u201d</p><h2>Charting his IEEE journey</h2><p>Pham joined IEEE in 1985 as a student member and credits the organization with shaping much of his professional life. IEEE provided a platform for scholarship, collaboration, and visibility at critical moments in his career, he says.</p><p>He served as associate technical editor of<a href=\"https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-magazine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Communications Magazine</em></em></a> from 1992 to 2000, was a guest editor for a special issue on fault-tolerant software in the June 1993<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17387&amp;tip=sid#google_vignette\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Reliability</em></em></a>, and was the program vice chair of the annual IEEE<a href=\"https://rams.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Reliability and Maintainability Symposium</a> in 1994. In 2024 he returned to Vietnam as a plenary speaker at the 16th <a href=\"https://sice-si.org/SII2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration</a>.</p><p>In addition to being named a distinguished professor at Rutgers, he served as chair of the<a href=\"https://www.ise.rutgers.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> industrial and systems engineering department</a> from 2007 to 2013.</p><p>\u201cIf my journey holds one lesson,\u201d he says, \u201cit is this: Struggle builds resilience, and resilience makes the extraordinary possible. Even in darkness, perseverance lights the way.\u201d</p>"

That\u2019s a 36 percent jump from the company\u2019s previous outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and\u2014perhaps most significantly\u2014a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that could turn the data center boom into a bust.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_1\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p>The power grid engineering workforce is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">currently shrinking</a>, and data center operators are also hurting for trained <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-jobs\" target=\"_self\">electrical engineers</a>. Laura Laltrello, the chief operating officer for <a href=\"https://www.applieddigital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Applied Digital</a>, says demand has accelerated for civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers, as well as construction management and oversight positions in recent months. (Applied Digital is a data center developer and operator that is building two data center campuses near Harwood, North Dakota, that will require 1.4 GW of power when completed.) The growing demand for skilled workers has forced her company to widen the recruitment perimeter.</p><p>\u201cAs we anticipate a shortage of traditional engineering talent, we are sourcing from diverse industries,\u201d says Laltrello. \u201cWe are finding experts who understand power and cooling from sectors like nuclear energy, the military, and aerospace. Expertise doesn\u2019t have to come from a data center background.\u201d</p><h2>Growing Demand for Data Center Engineers</h2><p>For every engineer needed to design, specify, build, inspect, commission, or run a new AI data center, dozens of other positions are in short supply. According to the Association for Computer Operations and Management\u2019s (AFCOM) <a href=\"https://afcom.com/news/news.asp?id=692525\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Data Center Report 2025</a>, 58 percent of data center managers<span> </span>identified multiskilled data center operators as the top area of growth, while 50 percent signaled increasing demand for data center engineers. Security specialists are also a critical need.</p><p>Through the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for almost <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-14/whats-behind-the-projected-construction-employment-growth-from-2023-to-2033.htm\" target=\"_blank\">400,000 more construction workers by 2033</a>. By far the biggest needs are in power infrastructure, electricians, plumbing, and HVAC, <a target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and roughly </a><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">17,500 electrical and electronics engineers</a>.<span> </span>These categories directly map to the skills required to design, build, commission, and operate modern data centers.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is not simply the absolute number of workers available, but the timing and intensity of demand,\u201d says Bill Kleyman, author of the AFCOM report and the CEO of AI infrastructure firm <a href=\"https://www.apolo.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Apolo</a>. \u201cData centers are expanding at the same time that utilities, manufacturing, renewables, grid infrastructure, and construction are all competing for the same skilled labor pool, and AI is amplifying this pressure.\u201d</p><p>Data center developers like <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a> and construction firms like <a href=\"https://www.crusoe.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Crusoe</a> face enormous demands to build faster, bigger, and more power-dense facilities. For example, they\u2019re developing the Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, for Oracle and OpenAI. The project has two buildings that went live in October 2025, with another six scheduled for completion by the middle of 2026. The entire AI data center campus, once completed, will require 1.2 GW of power.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_6\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-mcnamara-1055211/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael McNamara</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a>, says that in one year his company can currently build enough AI data center infrastructure to require 1 GW of power. Big tech firms, he says, want this raised to 1 GW a quarter and eventually 1 GW per month or less.</p><p>That kind of ramp-up of construction pace calls for tens of thousands more engineers. The shortage of engineering talent is paralleled by persistent staffing shortages in data center operations and facility management professionals, electrical and mechanical technicians, high-voltage and power systems engineers, skilled HVAC technicians with experience in high-density or liquid cooling, and construction specialists familiar with complex mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) integration, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhawkins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Hawkins</a>, the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>director of education for Uptime Institute.</p><p>\u201cDemand for each category is rising significantly faster than supply,\u201d says Hawkins.</p><p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>Technical colleges and applied education programs are among the most effective engines for workforce growth in the data center industry. They focus on hands-on skills, facilities operations, power and cooling systems, and real-world job readiness. With so many new data centers being built in Texas, workforce programs are popping up all over that state. One example is the SMU Lyle School of Engineering\u2019s Master of Science in Datacenter Systems Engineering (MS DSE) in Dallas. The program blends electrical engineering, IT, facilities management, business continuity, and cybersecurity. There is also a 12-week AI data center technician program at Dallas College and a similar program at Texas State Technical College near Waco.</p><p>\u201cTechnical colleges are driving the charge in bringing new talent to an industry undergoing exponential growth with an almost infinite appetite for skilled workers,\u201d says Wendy Schuchart, an association manager at AFCOM.</p><p>Vendors and industry associations are actively addressing the talent gap too. Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/datacenteracademy.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Datacenter Academy</a> is a public-private partnership involving community colleges in regions where Microsoft operates data center facilities. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://datacenters.google/workforce-development-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google supports</a> local nonprofits and colleges offering training in IT and data center operations, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/technical-apprenticeships\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon offers data center apprenticeships</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/us/en/products/energy/low-voltage/siemens-educates-america.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens Educates America</a> program has surpassed 32,000 apprenticeships across 32 states, 36 labs, and 72 partner industry labor organizations.

Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills\u2014capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace.</p><p>AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybercrime\" target=\"_self\">cybercrime</a>, predict equipment failures in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stealthy-startup-aims-to-reinvent-ai-for-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">manufacturing</a>, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-jobs\" target=\"_self\">mass layoffs</a> across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals.</p><p>Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/discover-manager-credit-card-fraud\" target=\"_self\">banking</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotic-process-automation-gokul-pandy\" target=\"_self\">health care</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai\" target=\"_self\">retail</a>, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making\u2014and keep up with the competition.</p><p>The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/san-murugesan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Murugesan</a> and<a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rneamtu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Rodica Neamtu</a>.</p><p>Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at <a href=\"https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Western Sydney University</a>, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at <a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, in Massachusetts.</p><p>The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains.</p><p>The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework.</p><h2>Why AI careers are being redefined</h2><p>AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy.</p><p>Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write.</p><p>The guide cites surveys of executives about AI\u2019s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey & Co.</a> The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants\u2019 insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate.</p><p>The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve.</p><h2>Developing complementary skills</h2><p>The strategic approach aligns with advice from <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/neil-thompson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Thompson</a>, director of FutureTech research at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.</p><p>\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,\u201d he says. \u201cApplying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.\u201d</p><h2>The technical foundation still matters</h2><p>Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning\" target=\"_self\"> machine learning</a>, and computing infrastructure.</p><p>Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say.</p><p>Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say.</p><p>Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Web Services</a>,<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Cloud</a>, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmfq865whp_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21503043035&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_sCA_X2u0APALLSysANK0Vhk&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure</a> is important, according to the guide\u2019s authors.</p><p>Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2025\" target=\"_self\">Python</a> has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models.</p><h2>From algorithms to frameworks</h2><p>The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PyTorch</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.meta.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meta AI</a>, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scikit-learn</a> provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. <strong>\u2014Neil Thompson, MIT</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TensorFlow</a>, a software library for machine learning and AI created by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?zx=1767047914659&amp;no_sw_cr=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction.</p><p>The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints.</p><h2>Soft skills as career insurance</h2><p>Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders.</p><p>Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning.</p><p>Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt.</p><h2>Experience before titles</h2><p>The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience.</p><p>Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career.</p><h2>Entry-level roles that open doors</h2><p>Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide.</p><p>Each starting point reinforces the guide\u2019s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance.</p><h2>Curiosity as a long-term strategy</h2><p>Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process.</p><p>\u201cAlways be curious,\u201d he says. \u201cLearn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.\u201d</p><p>Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one\u2019s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend.</p><p>In a field where today\u2019s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide\u2019s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.</p>"

The English band Pink Floyd blared through the speakers of my mom\u2019s Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, beckoning us to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFdkM40KOhE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dark side of the moon</a>.</p><p>The far side of the moon, the term most scientists prefer, is indeed dark (half the time), cold, and inhospitable. There\u2019s regolith and a couple of Chinese landers\u2014Chang\u2019e 4 in January 2019 and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-moon-landing-uncrewed-chang-e6\" target=\"_blank\">Chang\u2019e 6</a> in June 2024\u2014and not much else. That could change in about a year, as Contributing Editor Ned Potter reports in \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-radio-telescope\" target=\"_blank\">The Quest to Build a Telescope That Can Hear the Cosmic Dark Ages</a>.\u201d Firefly Aerospace\u2019s <a href=\"https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ghost Mission 2</a> with the LuSEE-Night radio telescope aboard will attempt to become the third successful mission to land there.</p><p>The moon\u2019s far side is the perfect place for such a telescope. The same RF waves that carried images of Neil Armstrong setting foot on the lunar surface, Roger Waters\u2019s voice, and hundreds of Ned Potter\u2019s space and science segments for the U.S. broadcast networks CBS and ABC interfere with terrestrial radio telescopes. If your goal is to detect the extremely faint and heavily redshifted signals of neutral hydrogen from the cosmic Dark Ages, you just can\u2019t do it from Earth. This epoch is so-called because we Earthlings have yet to sense anything from this time period, which started about 380,000 years after the big bang and lasted 200 million to 400 million years. The far side of the moon may be a terrible place to live, but it\u2019s shielded from all the noise of Earth, making it the ideal spot to place a radio telescope.</p><p>As Potter emphasized to me recently, LuSEE-Night won\u2019t listen for a signal from Dark Ages hydrogen directly. \u201cWill the hydrogen from the Dark Ages send a signal? No,\u201d says Potter. \u201cBut all that hydrogen out there may absorb a little bit of energy from the cosmic microwave background, interfering with that even more distant remnant of the big bang.\u201d</p><p>The far side may not stay quiet for much longer. Several countries, including China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, are making slow but steady progress toward establishing a lunar presence. As they do so, they\u2019ll place more relay satellites into orbit around the moon to support exploratory activities as well as moon bases planned for the next decade and beyond. That means the window on a noise-free far side is closing. LuSEE-Night, a project 40 years in the making, might just get there in the nick of time.</p><p>Potter is tracking emerging protocols that could preserve the far side\u2019s electromagnetic silence even as such efforts advance. Radio astronomers he\u2019s talked to have shared ideas about how to prevent this emerging problem from turning into a crisis. \u201cThere are no bad guys in this story, at least not yet,\u201d says Potter. \u201cBut there are a lot of well-meaning people who could complicate the picture a great deal if they don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a picture to complicate.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a busy time for moon missions. In addition to Blue Ghost Mission 2, the Chinese are sending Chang\u2019e 7 to the moon\u2019s south pole, while NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artemis-2\" target=\"_self\">Artemis II</a> is scheduled to enter the first of three launch windows this month. Artemis II will be the first mission to put humans into lunar orbit since the last Apollo mission in 1972.
