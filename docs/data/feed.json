AGI makes it feasible to perform all economically valuable work using compute. I distinguish between bottleneck and supplementary work\u2014tasks that are essential versus non-essential for unhindered growth. As computational resources expand: (i) the economy automates all bottleneck work, (ii) some supplementary work may be left exclusively to humans, (iii) output becomes linear in compute and labor and its growth is driven by the expansion of compute, (iv) wages converge to the opportunity cost of computational resources required to reproduce human work, and (v) the share of labor income in GDP converges to zero."

We derive pricing formulas that depart from profit maximization by incorporating incentives to improve welfare and reduce labor disruptions. Using US data, we evaluate several scenarios. A welfarist firm that values both profit and welfare should price closer to marginal cost, as efficiency gains outweigh distributional concerns. A conservative firm focused on labor-market stability should price above the profit-maximizing level in the short run, especially when its AI may displace low-income workers. Overall, socially minded firms face a trade-off between expanding access to AI and the resulting loss in profits and labor market risks."

        "summary": "This paper demonstrates that ignoring the source of variation in tariff levels yields misleading conclusions regarding the effects of tariff changes. Specifically, we show that changes in the ad valorem equivalent (AVE) tariff are insufficient to quantify the magnitude or sign of the effect of tariff changes on economic outcomes. To illustrate this point, we construct the first database of annual US statutory tariffs from 1972 to 1988 and use it to explore the consequences of liberalization in the years spanning the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Decomposing the aggregate AVE into its statutory and endogenous components, we document two distinct liberalizations in our sample. Prior to 1979, inflation combines with specific tariffs to create an \u201caccidental liberalization\u201d, despite the absence of widespread statutory tariff changes. After 1979, endogenous changes in the composition of imports mask the large Tokyo Round statutory tariff liberalization. Generalizing an exact hat framework to accommodate specific tariffs, we show that inflation-driven reductions in AVEs account for roughly half of the tariff liberalization in our sample, but these changes ultimately reduce imports and welfare. Finally, we show that specific tariffs remain an important determinant of cross-sectional variation in AVEs: between 2000 and 2017, one-third to one-half of the annual cross-sectional variance in good-level AVEs is driven by variation in the AVE of specific tariffs."

        "summary": "Policymakers often cite the risk that inflation expectations might \u201cde-anchor\u201d as a key reason for responding forcefully to inflationary shocks. We develop a model to analyze this trade-off and to quantify the benefits of stable long-run inflation expectations. In our framework, households and firms are imperfectly informed about the central bank\u2019s objective and learn from its policy choices. Recognizing this interaction, the central bank raises interest rates more aggressively after adverse supply shocks and accepts short-run output costs to secure more stable inflation expectations. The strength of this reputation channel depends on how sensitive long-run inflation expectations are to surprises in interest rates. Using high-frequency identification, we estimate these elasticities for emerging and advanced economies and find large negative values for Brazil. We fit our model to these findings and use it to quantify how reputation building motives affect monetary policy decisions, and the role of central bank's credibility in promoting macroeconomic stability."

It uses rich administrative data to study the effects of an Italian reform that raised social security contributions for apprenticeship contracts but granted a substantial discount for firms with 9 employees or less. The discount does not increase demand for apprenticeship contracts. Instead, it subsidizes inframarginal hiring. This reform is not cost-effective. Point estimates imply that each million euros of foregone social security contributions supports the employment of 29 apprentices for one year and no permanent contracts (these estimates are not statistically different from zero)."

Combining data on county-level erosion, the historical geography of crop production, and crop-specific innovation, I document that in the wake of the environmental crisis, agricultural technology development was strongly and persistently re-directed toward more Dust Bowl-exposed crops and, within crops, toward bio-chemical and planting technologies that could directly mitigate economic losses from environmental distress. County-level exposure to Dust Bowl-induced innovation significantly dampened the effect of land erosion on agricultural land values and revenue. These results highlight the role of crises in spurring innovation and the importance of endogenous technological progress as an adaptive force in the face of disasters."

        "summary": "We ask to what extent the quantification of labor market power depends on the modeling of the long-term worker-firm employment relationship. We develop an oligopsony model with dynamic wage contracts. Workers decide whether and where to work, choosing among firms providing different amenities and solving a dynamic discrete choice labor supply problem with firm-specific human capital. As a result, firms optimally choose wage-tenure contracts to attract and retain workers. We find that such contracts mitigate firms' incentives to impose large instantaneous wage markdowns\u2014compared to standard static wage-setting models\u2014thereby reducing the share of socially inefficient worker-firm separations. As a consequence, we show that the empirical approaches based on \"sufficient statistics\" tend to overestimate the extent of labor market power: low levels of firm-specific labor supply elasticities do not necessarily indicate rent extraction, but instead reflect firms\u2019 ability to retain workers by offering long-term value through human capital accumulation."

AI is making warfare more precise and deadly amidst intransigent conflicts. AI companies are exploiting people in the global South who work as data labelers, and profiting from content creators worldwide by using their work without license or compensation. The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" target=\"_blank\">enormous energy demands</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, particularly in the United States, public investment in science seems to be <a href=\"https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/leading-research-universities-report/white-house-proposes-steep-cuts-science-and-education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>redirected</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/trump-plan-highlights-ai-for-science\" target=\"_blank\">concentrated</a> on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And Big Tech companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.</p><p>This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here\u2019s how.</p><h2>The Academy\u2019s View of AI <a target=\"_blank\"></a></h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Pew study</span></a> in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn\u2019t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 <a href=\"https://sci-ops.org/survey/artificial-intelligence-survey-x/scientists-perceptions-and-personal-use/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of generative AI in daily life\u2014by nearly a three to one ratio.</p><p>We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, cybersecurity, physical sciences, drug discovery, public health, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we\u2019ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we\u2019ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.</p><p>We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.</p><h2>Elements of a Positive Vision for AI</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/working-waterfront/hope-a-framework-for-climate-action/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://time.com/7178677/climate-scientist-optimist-refuse-to-give-up-hope/\" target=\"_blank\">have</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">rgu</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w\" target=\"_blank\">ed</a> <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that</a> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">turn</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ing</a> the <a href=\"https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/making-case-climate-optimism\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tide</a> of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.</p><p>There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples\u2019 lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.</p><p>Some examples: AI is eliminating communication barriers across languages, including under-resourced contexts like <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5230744\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>marginalized sign languages</span></a> and <a href=\"https://ojs.bilpub.com/index.php/card/article/view/517\" target=\"_blank\">indigenous African languages</a>. It is helping policymakers incorporate the viewpoints of many constituents through AI-assisted <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adq2852\" target=\"_blank\">deliberations</a> and <a href=\"https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legislative engagement</a>.

National labs are building AI <a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/cels/auroragpt-foundation-models-for-science\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">foundation models</a> to accelerate scientific research. And throughout the fields of medicine and biology, machine learning is solving scientific problems like the prediction of protein structure in aid of drug discovery, which was recognized with a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel Prize</a> in 2024.</p><p>While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.</p><h2><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>A Call to Action for Scientists</h2><p>In our new book, <span><em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\">Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship</a></em></span><span>, we describe four key actions for policymakers committed to steering AI toward the public good.</span></p><p>These apply to scientists as well. Researchers should work to <strong>reform</strong> the AI industry to be more ethical, equitable, and trustworthy. We must collectively<a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"><span>develop</span></a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121\" target=\"_blank\">ethical</a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8\" target=\"_blank\">norms</a> for research that advance and applies AI, and should use and draw attention to AI developers who adhere to those norms. </p><p>Second, we should <strong>resist</strong> harmful uses of AI by documenting the negative applications of AI and casting a light on inappropriate uses. </p><p>Third, we should <strong>responsibly use</strong> AI to make society and peoples\u2019 lives better, exploiting its capabilities to help the communities they serve. </p><p>And finally, we must advocate for the <strong>renovation</strong> of institutions to prepare them for the impacts of AI; universities, professional societies, and democratic organizations are all vulnerable to disruption.</p><p>Scientists have a special privilege and responsibility: We are close to the technology itself and therefore well positioned to influence its trajectory. We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Melvin Kranzberg observed</span></a>, \u201cis neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today. But we cannot create a positive future without a vision of what it looks like.</p>"

Your eyes guide your hand to the opening, but once inside, you rely almost entirely on touch to distinguish your keys from your wallet, phone, and other items. This seamless transition between sensory modalities (knowing when to rely on vision versus touch) is something humans do effortlessly but robots struggle with. The challenge isn\u2019t just about having multiple sensors. Modern robots are equipped with cameras, tactile sensors, depth sensors, and more. The real problem is **how to integrate these different sensory streams**, especially when some sensors provide sparse but critical information at key moments. Our solution comes from rethinking how we combine modalities. Instead of forcing all sensors through a single network, we train separate expert policies for each modality and learn how to combine their action predictions at the policy level.</em></blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span></p><p>Multi-university Collaboration presented via [ <a href=\"https://policyconsensus.github.io/\">GitHub</a> ]</p><p>Thanks, Haonan!</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"kjb0dcvey_e\">Happy (somewhat late) Halloween from Pollen Robotics!</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span></p><p>[ <a href=\"https://www.pollen-robotics.com/\">Pollen Robotics</a> ]</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><blockquote class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"i2omq5c2o5a\"><em>In collaboration with our colleagues from Iowa State and University of Georgia, we have put our pipe-crawling <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/underground-power-lines-robots\" target=\"_blank\">worm robot </a>to test in the field.

Menifee, by contrast, is producing operational data in real households.</p><h2>Why CCS Matters</h2><p>When electric vehicles first hit the market, CCS was designed for one job: move power quickly from the grid to the car. The main goal was reliable, standardized, fast charging. That fact helps explain the difference between CCS public chargers, (many of which are rated for 350-kilowatts or more) and their CHAdeMO-based counterparts, which typically max out at 100 kW (but are capable of providing home backup or grid services).</p><p>Bidirectional operation wasn\u2019t included in the original CCS standard for several reasons. Early automakers and utilities worried about safety risks, grid interference, and added hardware cost. So CCS\u2019s original communication protocol linking EVs and charging stations\u2014<a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/55365.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 15118</a>\u2014didn\u2019t even include an electronic handshake for power export. The 2022 update, <a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/iso/iso15118202022?ad_acct=0000&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=1042027569&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_gXFXvQl5EQDGOCEFGoh01iGDy7&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvJHIBhCgARIsAEQnWlD3zc6ZUuyEO-qdCkAL2-Kv1Mvg3Cz3_Ew5PD8jfmM0o-JDSdJ3YHsaAvwfEALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 15118-20</a>, added secure two-way communication, enabling CCS vehicles to supply energy to buildings and the grid.</p><p>Wallbox\u2019s Quasar 2 residential charger implements the update through an active-bridge converter circuit built with silicon-carbide transistors, achieving efficient bidirectional flow. Its <a href=\"https://support.wallbox.com/wp-content/uploads/ht_kb/2025/04/Datasheet_QX2NA_EN_0225.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12-kW</a> power rating can support typical critical loads in a house, such as heating and cooling, refrigeration, and networking, says <a href=\"https://es.linkedin.com/in/aleix-maix%C3%A9-sas-28a6724b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aleix Maix\u00e9 Sas</a>, a system electronics architect at Wallbox.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An electric SUV plugged into a charger that is mounted on the exterior of a residential garage.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fb01e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-electric-suv-plugged-into-a-charger-that-is-mounted-on-the-exterior-of-a-residential-garage.jpg?id=62054284&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">As the company\u2019s name humbly suggests, Wallbox\u2019s chargers look like plain old boxes\u2014although they contain high-tech components.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Wallbox</small></p><h2>The Menifee blueprint</h2><p>Each of the Menifee homes outfitted with a V2H system combines a rooftop solar array with a 13-kWh <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/solar/sunpower-sunvault-review/\" target=\"_blank\">SunVault</a> stationary battery from <a href=\"https://us.sunpower.com/home-solar/solar-battery-storage\" target=\"_blank\">SunPower</a>. During normal operation, solar energy powers daily household loads and charges the stationary battery. On abundantly sunny days, the solar panels can also top up the Kia EV9\u2019s battery. When the grid fails\u2014or when energy prices spike\u2014the home isolates itself: Solar power and energy stored in the SunVault keep essential systems and appliances going, while the EV battery extends power if the outage persists.</p><p>This past summer, the UC Irvine researchers tracked how solar output, stationary storage, and vehicle power interacted under summer demand and wildfire-related grid stress. They found that \u201cthe vehicle adds a major resilience feature,\u201d according to Samuelsen, who is the <span>Menifee project manager. \u201cIt can relieve grid strain, increase renewable utilization, and lower costs by supplying power during peak-rate hours.\u201d</span></p><h2>Engineering the Two-Way Home</h2><p>Home builders and the makers of electric vehicle service equipment such as Wallbox are not the only entities reconsidering how to meet the engineering demands V2H introduces. Utilities, too, must make changes to accommodate bidirectional power flow. Interconnection procedures and energy pricing structures are among the factors that must be redesigned or reconsidered.</p><h2>A Glimpse of the Energy Future</h2><p>Analysts expect <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/bidirectional-charging.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">double-digit annual growth in bidirectional-charging system sales</a> through the late 2020s as costs fall and standards mature. In regions facing wildfire- or storm-related outages and steep time-of-use pricing curves, projects like Menifee\u2019s are showing a clear path towards the use of cars as huge and flexible energy reserves.</p><p>When EV batteries can supply energy for homes as easily as they do for propulsion, the boundary between transportation and energy will begin to disappear\u2014and with it, old concepts regarding who\u2019s an energy supplier and who\u2019s a customer.</p>"

But this high-altitude confab is no Victorian perambulation. It\u2019s a vital component of a sprawling, cutting-edge project that is pushing the boundaries of bioinformatics and the tools of modern genomics. These researchers are taking part in the first international field expedition of<a href=\"https://www.projectpsyche.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Project Psyche</a>, whose goal is to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of moths and butterflies in Europe. <a href=\"https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9760/\" target=\"_blank\">Psyche</a> is part of a larger effort, the<a href=\"https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Darwin Tree of Life project</a>, which is itself a component of arguably the most ambitious science project of all time: the<a href=\"https://www.earthbiogenome.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Earth BioGenome Project</a>. Its goal is to sequence the genomes of <em><em>all</em></em> of Earth\u2019s roughly 1.8 million organisms\u2014every named species of animal, plant, fungus, and microbe that\u2019s made up of cells that have a nucleus.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\"><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a></p><p>None of these hugely ambitious efforts would be conceivable without the enormous advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics over the past couple of decades. The cost and speed of sequencing an individual genome have declined to the point where it\u2019s now possible to batch process multiple genomes in a single day and for less than US $1,000 apiece. And the revolutions in biotech that have made such a feat possible are still gathering steam. Indeed, Earth BioGenome officials freely admit that their bold goal\u2014to sequence those 1.8 million named species by 2035\u2014won\u2019t be possible without a hundredfold decrease in the time and cost of sequencing.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>But the project\u2019s success may ultimately hinge on functions <em><em>other</em></em> than sequencing. For example, after a creature\u2019s genome is sequenced, the huge mass of raw genetic data\u2014consisting of millions or billions of genetic building blocks called base pairs\u2014must be annotated. That is, the tens of thousands of genes that make up the genome must be identified, located on chromosomes, and their functions or purpose described. And, of course, <em><em>before</em></em> an organism\u2019s genome can be sequenced, its tissues must be sampled. To do that, researchers must locate the organism and, if it\u2019s an animal, capture it.

By studying and comparing the genomes of different species, Wright explains, \u201cwe can find out how they have evolved and how they\u2019ve diversified, as there have been different climatic shifts in Europe. And the genomes can help to tell us why it is that some groups of Lepidoptera have evolved into a greater number of species than others.\u201d</p><p>Those genomes will also offer insights into some of the most intriguing questions of evolutionary biology. Consider: Most moths and butterflies have genomes with around 31 pairs of chromosomes, which are the threadlike strands in every cell\u2019s nucleus, each of which is a molecule of DNA. Collectively, chromosomes make up a creature\u2019s genome. But a tiny minority of the Lepidoptera order have enormous numbers of chromosomes. Exhibit A is the<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01098-X\" target=\"_blank\"> Atlas blue butterfly</a>, which has an astonishing 229 pairs of chromosomes.</p><p>The Atlas blue is \u201ca very good example of something that\u2019s really fascinating, but we cannot understand it just by looking at one species,\u201d says Meier. \u201cWhat we really need is what Psyche will provide, which is replications\u201d\u2014thousands of Lepidoptera genomes. And, not incidentally, the ability to browse them easily. \u201cThen we will find many lineages that have an unusually large number of chromosomes, and we can then start to ask, \u2018What changes each time? What do they have in common? Do they have a repair gene that\u2019s broken?\u2019 \u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Some three dozen species of Lepidoptera are seen pinned to a display board, with tiny hand-written notes associated with each one.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a9f32\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/some-three-dozen-species-of-lepidoptera-are-seen-pinned-to-a-display-board-with-tiny-hand-written-notes-associated-with-each-on.jpg?id=61998921&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Some exceptional samples of Lepidoptera are preserved for entomological archives.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>And it\u2019s not just theoreticians eagerly awaiting such genomic data.

He\u2019s wearing a black camp shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks, black hiking boots, and chunky retro eyewear, and he\u2019s carrying a butterfly net (yep, it\u2019s black). He\u2019s still and silent, taking in nuances of light, vegetation, and wind that would affect a moth\u2019s flight path through the area. Thinking like a moth, he visualizes the routes it would likely take through side valleys and ravines.</p><p>The objective is to figure out where to place three butterfly traps for the night. Setting the traps in different \u201cmicroenvironments,\u201d he explains, will likely yield a broader range of creatures. But there\u2019s no formula for this. Capturing critters depends heavily on intuition arising from experience, perception, and judgment.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young man in a bright blue T-shirt and black cargo pants standing on a slope amid brilliant purple wildflowers swings a bright yellow butterfly net.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"70ee6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-man-in-a-bright-blue-t-shirt-and-black-cargo-pants-standing-on-a-slope-amid-brilliant-purple-wildflowers-swings-a-brigh.jpg?id=61998951&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Genetics researcher No\u00e9 Dogbo, of the Institute of Research on Insect Biology in Tours, France, chases a butterfly during a hunting session in the Roja mountains near Curon Venosta, Bolzano, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Luigi Avantaggiato        </small></p><p>\u201cOver there\u201d\u2014he points across the valley to the opposite slope. \u201cIt faces north. See? No flowers. That\u2019s what I mean by different microenvironments.\u201d We\u2019re perched on the south-facing slope, about 80 meters above the valley bottom, on a trail about as wide as a toaster oven.</p><p>Hours later, after dodging cow patties the size of dinner plates and gaping holes leading to marmot burrows, the locations are chosen and the traps are set. There\u2019s one on the south slope, one on the north, and one near the fast-flowing stream between them. As the sky darkens to a deep blue, we trudge back to the hut to stoke the fire and wait.</p><p>At the crack of dawn the next day, Moro is jubilant as he returns with the night\u2019s haul. There are at least 150 moths, including the spectacular yellow tiger moth. The species that are needed for Project Psyche, as identified by Torrado-Blanco, are put in plastic specimen jars and will make their way down to the makeshift lab at the Hotel Tyrol. There, they\u2019ll be photographed and then stunned and killed by exposure to dry ice, before being dissected. The head, thorax, and abdomen will be packed in separate plastic tubes for state-of-the-art DNA and RNA sequencing at the laboratories of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The Wellcome Trust is the lead sponsor of both Project Psyche and the Darwin Tree of Life project.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A dark-haired woman uses tweezers to insert a moth abdomen into a tiny glass vial.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a298a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-dark-haired-woman-uses-tweezers-to-insert-a-moth-abdomen-into-a-tiny-glass-vial.jpg?id=61998979&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A closeup of the vial shows an attached label with a bar code.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6f815\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-closeup-of-the-vial-shows-an-attached-label-with-a-bar-code.jpg?id=61998977&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Lepidopterist Joana Meier of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a leader of Project Psyche, packs the abdomen of a moth into a vial for shipment from Italy to the institute in England.

It\u2019s not that he dislikes butterflies, mind you, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s a bit weary of them overshadowing moths in the public imagination. Butterflies are big, bright, and colorful, sure, but also delicate. They appeared much, much later than moths in evolutionary history. And they can\u2019t even fly at night or in the rain. \u201cButterflies are just day-flying moths,\u201d Wahlberg quips. \u201cPeople think of them as different and special, but they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>In this new era of mass genome sequencing, they\u2019re also arguably less important scientifically. To begin with, butterflies are just 10 percent of all known species of Lepidoptera\u2014about 19,000 are butterflies while perhaps 180,000 or more are moths. Of the 11,000 <a href=\"https://www.ourbreathingplanet.com/6-fabulous-european-lepidoptera/\" target=\"_blank\">European Lepidoptera</a> species that are of interest to Project Psyche, only 560 of them are butterflies, by Wahlberg\u2019s reckoning. And they\u2019ve already collected two-thirds of them, he adds.</p><p>So the real challenge for Psyche is finding and identifying all those moths. Particularly the<a href=\"https://www.lesfruitsdemer.com/wild-statia-what-are-micromoths/\" target=\"_blank\"> micromoths</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/size-really-doesnt-matter-when-it-comes-to-micro-and-macro-moths.html\" target=\"_blank\">Micromoths</a> have long vexed entomologists. The largest of them have wingspans about as wide as a U.S. dime, or a 2 euro cent coin; <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/tiniest-moths-in-the-world.html\" target=\"_blank\">the smallest</a> can fit on the head of a pin. As a group, they evolved not only much earlier than butterflies but also much earlier than all other moths (which are known as \u201cmacromoths\u201d). There are a <em><em>lot</em></em> of micromoths\u2014at least 62,000 species, by the current estimate. Among them are many pairs or other small groups of species that are so similar that not even the most experienced lepidopterists can tell them apart by eye.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\" A young woman stands at night next to a plastic vessel, about a meter tall, which is lit from within by a purple glow.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d5d8d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-woman-stands-at-night-next-to-a-plastic-vessel-about-a-meter-tall-which-is-lit-from-within-by-a-purple-glow.jpg?id=61999056&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute collects a moth at a light trap on an Alpine trail above Malles Venosta, Italy.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>That\u2019s going to be an enormous challenge for Project Psyche, Wahlberg notes. Fortunately, though, it\u2019s a problem for which there is a technological solution:<a href=\"https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/16908-The-history-of-DNA-barcoding.html\" target=\"_blank\"> DNA barcoding</a>.</p><p>Besides the DNA in the nuclei of every cell, there exists other genetic material, called<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA\" target=\"_blank\"> mitochondrial DNA</a>, outside of the nucleus. It\u2019s relatively easy to access, and, crucially, there\u2019s a mitochondrial gene, called<a href=\"https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1937-the-ideal-barcoding-gene\" target=\"_blank\"> CO1</a>, that tends to vary markedly among species, even closely related ones. That makes this bit of genetic material invaluable for discriminating among related species. Researchers have built up several databases of these DNA barcodes that collectively contain millions of characteristic DNA sequences. \u201cWe have DNA barcodes for 99 percent of the Lepidoptera in Europe,\u201d Wahlberg says. \u201cAnd only about 5 percent of micromoth species have the same CO1 gene.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/dna-barcoding-species-detection-and-high-throughput-assays-71860\" target=\"_blank\">DNA barcoding</a> was invented in the early 2000s by<a href=\"https://scienceline.org/2008/02/tweed-bio-dnabarcoding/\" target=\"_blank\"> Paul Hebert</a> and colleagues at the<a href=\"https://www.uoguelph.ca/\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Guelph</a>, in Canada, and it has advanced greatly in recent years along with the DNA-sequencing technologies that underpin it. The technique starts with a minuscule sample of tissue; for example, in the makeshift lab at the hotel in Malles Venosta, researchers dissecting moths for sequencing also removed, for DNA barcoding, a leg of each moth whose species was not conclusively known.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman wearing a white lab coat retrieves boxes from a cold-storage unit.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f2165\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-wearing-a-white-lab-coat-retrieves-boxes-from-a-cold-storage-unit.jpg?id=61999084&amp;width=980\" /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A closeup shows the tops of small vials, each containing a tissue sample, within a box.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"af894\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-closeup-shows-the-tops-of-small-vials-each-containing-a-tissue-sample-within-a-box.jpg?id=61999081&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Sta\ufb00 Scientist Silvia P\u00e9rez Lluch of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona retrieves tissue samples for genome sequencing.

That material is sequenced using any one of the dozen or more types of sequencing machines available to researchers.</p><p>For barcoding purposes, typical DNA sequences of the CO1 gene run between 400 and 800 base pairs. But lately researchers have been developing techniques that use shorter or longer barcodes. The shorter codes, called mini-barcodes, have proven more effective in identifying a species even when the DNA samples are incomplete or damaged. A mini-barcode might have<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-9-214\" target=\"_blank\"> 100 to 250 base pairs</a>. Conversely, \u201csuper-barcodes,\u201d which can be many thousands of base pairs, are useful for differentiating among closely related species\u2014exactly the challenge with many of the micromoths.</p><h2>Why RNA Will Make Annotating Faster</h2><p>While the Psyche researchers honed the logistics and mechanics of sampling Lepidoptera, a different European Lepidoptera project was quietly making a technical advance that could resonate throughout the Earth BioGenome Project. Working together, Spanish and Andorran researchers affiliated with the<a href=\"https://www.biogenoma.cat/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\"> Catalan Initiative for the Earth BioGenome Project </a>sequenced the genome of the violet copper butterfly<em><em>, Lycaena helle</em></em>, a creature that was<a href=\"https://shilap.org/revista/article/view/185\" target=\"_blank\"> first studied in 1775</a><em><em>.</em></em> They described their efforts in<a href=\"https://f1000research.com/articles/14-60/v1\" target=\"_blank\"> a paper</a> published by <a href=\"https://f1000research.com/\" target=\"_blank\">F1000Research</a>.</p><p>This was no routine procedure. Typically when researchers map a genome, an organism is sampled and the DNA is sequenced. After sequencing, the mass of fragmented genetic data must be assembled into a complete genome sequence and then that complete sequence must be manually verified, in a process called curation, and then annotated. In annotation, the genome\u2019s many genes are identified and, ideally, their functions described.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A bespectacled man in a dark blue T-shirt stands next to a storage cabinet with his arms folded across his chest.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"085c4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-bespectacled-man-in-a-dark-blue-t-shirt-stands-next-to-a-storage-cabinet-with-his-arms-folded-across-his-chest.jpg?id=61999096&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ivo Gut, director of the Centro Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Gen\u00f3mico in Barcelona, has high hopes for an emerging technique to identify the genes within a large mass of genetic data.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>Today, curation and annotation are time-consuming processes, regarded as major bottlenecks to the rapid progress that the Earth BioGenome Project desperately needs to reach its 2035 goal. Finding the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411012682#:~:text=Summary,basis%20of%20long%2Ddistance%20migration\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of genes</a> within the huge mass of sequenced data is a mostly automated process now but it can involve some serious bioinformatic sleuthing. \u201cYou take your linear genome, your sequence, and you go and you say, \u2018Ah, look here. There\u2019s a gene that starts here,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.cnag.eu/ivo-g-gut\" target=\"_blank\"> Ivo Gut</a>, director of the<a href=\"https://www.cnag.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Centro Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Gen\u00f3mico</a> (CNAG), in Barcelona. \u201c \u2018And this is the structure of the gene.\u2019 And then you can sort of figure out what that is. You look whether that gene is known, for example, in another species. And then you go to the next one, and so on. And just by these similarity searches, you can usually annotate almost 80 percent, or maybe 70 percent,\u201d of what are known as coding genes in the genome. These coding genes encode the many proteins produced by cells, which serve vital functions in the organism.</p><p>Gut also notes that to perform annotations researchers are making increasing use of another genetic molecule, RNA, or<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\"> ribonucleic acid</a>. When a gene specifies, or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hudsonalpha.org/edna-gene-expression/\" target=\"_blank\">expresses</a>,\u201d a protein, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-rna-15169\" target=\"_blank\">RNA</a> acts as the \u201cmessenger,\u201d carrying the genetic code outside of the cell nucleus to the protein-making apparatus of the cell. Therefore RNA is extremely useful in figuring out where the protein-coding genes are in the genome. Different cells in the body express different proteins, but in every case that expression occurs because of a specific gene, and that gene can be identified conclusively from the RNA associated with it.</p><p>The breakthrough in the research by the Spanish and Andorran researchers was using a technique called long-read sequencing to sequence all of the RNA in their samples. While sequencing a genome, long-read machines handle much longer segments of DNA than traditional short-read systems. The greater length confers several advantages, including the ability to easily resolve repetitive sequences that can trip up short-read machines. [For more on long-read genome sequencing, see my recent article \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/whole-genome-sequencing#video\" target=\"_self\">The Quest to Sequence the Genomes of Everything</a>, in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>.\u201d] The researchers came from four Barcelona organizations\u2014CNAG, the<a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Centre for Genomic Regulation</a> (CRG), the<a href=\"https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Institute of Evolutionary Biology</a> at Pompeu Fabra University, and the<a href=\"https://web.ub.edu/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Barcelona</a>\u2014and from<a href=\"https://ari.ad/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Andorra Research and Innovation</a>, in Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria.</p><p>The genome of the female <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaena_helle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">violet copper butterfly</a>, which inhabits a huge swath of territory stretching from the Pyrenees to Siberia, consists of 25 pairs of chromosomes with a total of 547,306,268 base pairs. By using long-read sequencing of the RNA in the sample, the researchers were able to identify 20,122 protein-coding genes and 4,264 noncoding genes. In contrast to protein-coding genes, noncoding genes are harder to identify from one species to the next and they are also <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4687140/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">very difficult to predict by computational means</a>. Many noncoding genes serve important regulatory, protective, or other functions within a cell. Yet at least 30 percent of all annotated Lepidopteran genomes produced so far lack annotations of noncoding genes, and those that include them generally count relatively few, says <a href=\"https://www.crg.eu/roderic_guigo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Roderic Guig\u00f3 Serra</a>, who leads the Bioinformatics and Genomics program at the CRG.</p><p>\u201cLong-read RNA sequencing may be the only way to precisely locate them in genome sequences,\u201d he says. With long-read RNA sequencing, \u201cwe get better information on where the genes are and a more precise definition of the boundaries of the genes, and also we see genes that had not been seen before,\u201d Serra declares.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A woman wearing a white lab coat and lavender gloves holds a pipette above a black colored box roughly the size of desktop printer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"27c81\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-wearing-a-white-lab-coat-and-lavender-gloves-holds-a-pipette-above-a-black-colored-box-roughly-the-size-of-desktop-print.jpg?id=61999110&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">At the Guig\u00f2 Lab of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, a technician loads a sample into a genome sequencing machine. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Luigi Avantaggiato</small></p><p>His group is now applying the long-read RNA sequencing technique to a host of other species\u2014including humans.

Twenty-five years after the first draft sequence of the human genome, it turns out that there are still gaps in it\u2014particularly regarding the noncoding genes. Recently, using long-read RNA sequencing, the Gencode team shocked biologists by identifying <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39554180/\" target=\"_blank\">18,000 previously unknown noncoding human genes</a>. \u201cThese genes have been essentially ignored for almost 25 years, underscoring the power of the long-read RNA sequencing technology,\u201d says Serra.</p><p>Researchers are counting on such advances to help power them in their grand quest of sequencing and annotating the world\u2019s organisms. And within that quest, Project Psyche is off to an encouraging start. With nearly 3,000 of Europe\u2019s 11,000 Lepidopteran species sampled and more than 1,000 of those sequenced, Lepidoptera are now the most widely sequenced order of organisms. Still, that leaves perhaps 170,000 other members of the order elsewhere in the world to be sampled and sequenced.</p><p>It\u2019s a mammoth task.

But in high school, a mentor suggested that Berry consider engineering, given her strong grades in both math and science. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what an engineer was,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone who was an engineer.\u201d After learning about the profession at a library, Berry decided to study both engineering and math in college. In 1993, Berry earned a bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.gatech.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> as part of a dual degree program with <a href=\"https://www.spelman.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Spelman College</a>, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s in mathematics in 1992.</p><p>After her bachelor\u2019s degrees, Berry worked as a control engineer for Ford Motor Company, where she programmed assembly-line industrial robots, but she found herself yearning to answer her true calling as an educator. So, she returned to academia and got a master\u2019s in electrical engineering and control systems at <a href=\"https://wayne.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wayne State University</a> in 1996. Saddled with student loan debt, however, Berry then accepted a position as a control engineer for Detroit Edison. \u201cI really enjoyed the work but once again realized I was not doing what I was meant to do,\u201d she says. </p><p>After a year at Detroit Edison, she left in pursuit of her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, which she earned at <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Vanderbilt University</a> in 2003. As a grad student, Berry taught at a technical school\u2014and at last found herself on the right career path: \u201cI always wanted to be an educator,\u201d she says. </p><h2>A Turn Toward Outreach</h2><p>Berry traces her community-outreach work to two more pivotal moments in her career: In 2018, she became a full professor at Rose-Hulman, and in 2020, she became an endowed chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Berry says her tenure and position at Rose-Hulman enabled her to pursue work that brings her research, teaching, and service interests together.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three women of color sit in front of signs about Girls in STEM.

Here, she sits with students Liz Francois and Janae Gillus, both members of Rose-Hulman\u2019s chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Griffin Museum of Science and Industry</small></p><p>\u201cAs a full professor, I don\u2019t have to worry that someone might consider the [outreach] work I do not as important as my technical robotics work,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I provide education for students and for the community, that\u2019s also part of my research and service.\u201d <span>For Berry, research and service are not separate but intertwined subject areas: Her research involves designing open-source, low-cost mobile robots to promote more inclusive robotics education.</span></p><p>Since 2020, Berry has helped transform how electrical and computer engineering is taught and perceived. She has been teaching hands-on, interactive robotics not only to her students at Rose-Hulman but also to kids and adults across the nation. Berry has been taking her robots, as she says, \u201cto the streets.\u201d</p><p>Berry demonstrates and discusses her open-source, 3D-printed wheeled robots at schools, libraries, museums, and other community venues. Her audiences range from <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/sphero-indi-brings-robotics-to-prekindergarten\" target=\"_blank\">kids just a few years old</a> to adult educators who learn about robotics from Berry so they can teach the subject to their own students. To spread the word about robotics and STEM, Berry also has become active on social media, overcoming her innate introversion because, she explains, \u201cvisibility matters.\u201d</p><p>With any audience, Berry is always \u201cvery approachable and very engaging,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicki-manion/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicki Manion</a>, a program manager for Rose-Hulman\u2019s educational outreach who collaborates with Berry on professional development workshops for teachers.</p><p>\u201cI have to go where people are,\u201d Berry says. \u201cI get robots in front of people who are historically marginalized and would normally not have access to these technologies.\u201d</p><p>This past summer, for example, Berry shared her robots with children from about three to 10 years old at all of the dozens of branches of the Indianapolis Public Library. To understand the three main pillars of robotics\u2014sense, plan, act\u2014the kids learned how the robots use a sonar, microphone, and speaker in order to see, hear, and talk. Notably, at the end of each presentation, the kids got to play and interact with the robots.</p><p>Last year, as part of an IEEE Education Society Initiative, Berry brought her robots to the streets globally. After grad students in countries such as Costa Rica, Niger, and Uganda received parts in the mail, Berry showed them the basics of building and programming robots.</p><h2>Online Community and Writing</h2><p><span>Berry hasn\u2019t set out on her pedagogic journey all on her own, she says. In 2020, she cofounded <a href=\"https://blackinengineering.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Engineering</a> and <a href=\"https://blackinrobotics.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black in Robotics</a>\u2014part of the Black in X network comprising more than 80 organizations that support the work of Black professionals in STEM. For Berry, it\u2019s no coincidence that Black in X emerged early in the pandemic. \u201cThere were a lot of bad things about the pandemic, but because we were all home and on social media, we were able to connect and find each other and form these organizations that, five years later, are still going,\u201d she says.</span></p><p>Her professional turning point toward more community-oriented service has led to several accolades, she says: \u201cThat was when I started to earn these awards I had never been considered for before.\u201d In 2023, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society awarded Berry the prestigious Undergraduate Teaching Award for her contributions to multidisciplinary robotics education and leadership in diversifying STEM. She has also been recognized by the <a href=\"https://swe.org/magazine/dee-award-berry-22/\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Women Engineers</a> and <a href=\"https://ghc.anitab.org/awards-programs/abie-awards\" target=\"_blank\">AnitaB.org</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"The book cover for There's a Robot in My Closet, by Dr. Carlotta A.

Every leap\u2014whether it\u2019s smarter phones, more capable cars, or breakthroughs in healthcare and science\u2014relies on chips that are more complex, faster, and packed with more features than ever before. But creating these chips is not just a question of sheer engineering talent or ambition. The design process itself has reached staggering levels of complexity, and with it, the challenge to keep productivity and quality moving forward.</p><p>As we push against the boundaries of physics, chipmakers face more than just technical hurdles. The workforce challenges, tight timelines, and the requirements for building reliable chips are stricter than ever. Enormous effort goes into making sure chip layouts follow detailed constraints\u2014such as maintaining minimum feature sizes for transistors and wires, keeping proper spacing between different layers like metal, polysilicon, and active areas, and ensuring vias overlap correctly to create solid electrical connections. These design rules multiply with every new technology generation. For every innovation, there\u2019s pressure to deliver more with less. So, the question becomes: How do we help designers meet these demands, and how can technology help us handle the complexity without compromising on quality?</p><h2>Shifting the paradigm: the rise of AI in electronic design automation</h2><p>A major wave of change is moving through the entire field of electronic design automation (EDA), the specialized area of software and tools that chipmakers use to design, analyze, and verify the complex integrated circuits inside today\u2019s chips. Artificial intelligence is already touching many parts of the chip design flow\u2014helping with placement and routing, predicting yield outcomes, tuning analog circuits, automating simulation, and even guiding early architecture planning. Rather than simply speeding up old steps, AI is opening doors to new ways of thinking and working.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>Instead of brute-force computation or countless lines of custom code, AI uses advanced algorithms to spot patterns, organize massive datasets, and highlight issues that might otherwise take weeks of manual work to uncover. For example, generative AI can help designers ask questions and get answers in natural language, streamlining routine tasks. Machine learning models can help predict defect hotspots or prioritize risky areas long before sending a chip to be manufactured.</p><p>This growing partnership between human expertise and machine intelligence is paving the way for what some call a \u201cshift left\u201d or concurrent build revolution\u2014finding and fixing problems much earlier in the design process, before they grow into expensive setbacks. For chipmakers, this means higher quality and faster time to market. For designers, it means a chance to focus on innovation rather than chasing bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Flow diagram: IC design rule checking (DRC), SoC integration, physical verification showing errors.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c40c3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/flow-diagram-ic-design-rule-checking-drc-soc-integration-physical-verification-showing-errors.jpg?id=61784279&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 1.

Physical verification checks whether a chip layout meets the manufacturer\u2019s strict rules and faithfully matches the original functional schematic. Its main goal is to ensure the design can be reliably manufactured into a working chip, free of physical defects that might cause failures later on.</span></p><p>Design rule checking (DRC) is the backbone of physical verification. DRC software scans every corner of a chip\u2019s layout for violations\u2014features that might cause defects, reduce yield, or simply make the design un-manufacturable. But today\u2019s chips aren\u2019t just bigger; they\u2019re more intricate, woven from many layers of logic, memory, and analog components, sometimes stacked in three dimensions. The rules aren\u2019t simple either. They may depend on the geometry, the context, the manufacturing process and even the interactions between distant layout features.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Man with wavy black hair in a black blazer and white shirt against a plain background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"12f34\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-with-wavy-black-hair-in-a-black-blazer-and-white-shirt-against-a-plain-background.jpg?id=61784318&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Priyank Jain leads product management for Calibre Interfaces at Siemens EDA.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p>Traditionally, DRC is performed late in the flow, when all components are assembled into the final chip layout. At this stage, it\u2019s common to uncover millions of violations\u2014and fixing these late-stage issues requires extensive effort, leading to costly delays.</p><p>To minimize this burden, there\u2019s a growing focus on shifting DRC earlier in the flow\u2014a strategy called \u201cshift-left.\u201d Instead of waiting until the entire design is complete, engineers try to identify and address DRC errors much sooner at block and cell levels. This concurrent design and verification approach allows the bulk of errors to be caught when fixes are faster and less disruptive.</p><p>However, running DRC earlier in the flow on a full chip when the blocks are not DRC clean produces results datasets of breathtaking scale\u2014often tens of millions to billions of \u201cerrors,\u201d warnings, or flags because the unfinished chip design is \u201cdirty\u201d compared to a chip that\u2019s been through the full design process. Navigating these \u201cdirty\u201d results is a challenge all on its own. Designers must prioritize which issues to tackle, identify patterns that point to systematic problems, and decide what truly matters. In many cases, this work is slow and \u201cmanual,\u201d depending on the ability of engineers to sort through data, filter what matters, and share findings across teams.</p><p>To cope, design teams have crafted ways to limit the flood of information. They might cap the number of errors per rule, or use informal shortcuts\u2014passing databases or screenshots by email to team members, sharing filters in chat messages, and relying on experts to know where to look. Yet this approach is not sustainable. It risks missing major, chip-wide issues that can cascade through the final product. It slows down response and makes collaboration labor-intensive.</p><p>With ongoing workforce challenges and the surging complexity of modern chips, the need for smarter, more automated DRC analysis becomes urgent. So what could a better solution look like\u2014and how can AI help bridge the gap?</p><h2>The rise of AI-powered DRC analysis</h2><p>Recent breakthroughs in AI have changed the game for DRC analysis in ways that were unthinkable even a few years ago. Rather than scanning line by line or check by check, AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster. These tools use techniques from computer vision, advanced machine learning, and big data analytics to turn what once seemed like an impossible pile of information into a roadmap for action.</p><p>AI\u2019s ability to organize chaotic datasets\u2014finding systematic problems hidden across multiple rules or regions\u2014helps catch risks that basic filtering might miss. By grouping related errors and highlighting hot spots, designers can see the big picture and focus their time where it counts. AI-based clustering algorithms reliably transform weeks of manual investigation into minutes of guided analysis.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered systems can process billions of errors, cluster them into meaningful groups, and help designers find the root causes much faster.</p><p>Another benefit: collaboration. By treating results as shared, living datasets\u2014rather than static tables\u2014modern tools let teams assign owners, annotate findings and pass exact analysis views between block and partition engineers, even across organizational boundaries. Dynamic bookmarks and shared UI states cut down on confusion and rework. Instead of \u201cback and forth,\u201d teams move forward together.</p><p>Many of these innovations tease at what\u2019s possible when AI is built into the heart of the verification flow. Not only do they help designers analyze the results; they help everyone reason about the data, summarize findings and make better design decisions all the way to tape out.</p><h2>A real-world breakthrough in DRC analysis and collaboration: Siemens\u2019 Calibre Vision AI</h2><p>One of the most striking examples of AI-powered DRC analysis comes from <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens</a>, whose <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI platform</a> is setting new standards for how full-chip verification happens. Building on years of experience in physical verification, Siemens realized that breaking bottlenecks required not only smarter algorithms but rethinking how teams work together and how data moves across the flow.</p><p>Vision AI is designed for speed and scalability. It uses a compact error database and a multi-threaded engine to load millions\u2014or even billions\u2014of errors in minutes, visualizing them so engineers see clusters and hot spots across the entire die. Instead of a wall of error codes or isolated rule violations, the tool presents a heat map of the layout, highlighting areas with the highest concentration of issues. By enabling or disabling layers (layout, markers, heat map) and adjusting layer opacity, users get a clear, customizable view of what\u2019s happening\u2014and where to look next.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. </p><p>But the real magic is in AI-guided clustering. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, Vision AI analyzes every error to find groups with common failure causes. This means designers can attack the root cause once, fixing problems for hundreds of checks at a time instead of tediously resolving them one by one. In cases where legacy tools would force teams to slog through, for example, 3,400 checks with 600 million errors, Vision AI\u2019s clustering can reduce that effort to investigating just 381 groups\u2014turning mountains into molehills and speeding debug time by at least 2x.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Calibre Vision software, check groups, cells list, and die-view heatmap interface screenshot.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ac191\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/calibre-vision-software-check-groups-cells-list-and-die-view-heatmap-interface-screenshot.jpg?id=61784282&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 2. The Calibre Vision AI software automates and simplifies the chip-level DRC verification process.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><p><span>Vision AI is also highly collaborative. Dynamic bookmarks capture the exact state of analysis, from layer filters to zoomed layout areas, along with annotations and owner assignments. Sharing a bookmark sends a living analysis\u2014not just a static snapshot\u2014to coworkers, so everyone is working from the same view. Teams can export results databases, distribute actionable groups to block owners, and seamlessly import findings into other Siemens EDA tools for further debug.</span></p><h2>Empowering every designer: reducing the expertise gap</h2><p>A frequent pain point in chip verification is the need for deep expertise\u2014knowing which errors matter, which patterns mean trouble, and how to interpret complex results. Calibre Vision AI helps level the playing field. Its AI-based algorithms consistently create the same clusters and debug paths that senior experts would identify, but does so in minutes. New users can quickly find systematic issues and perform like seasoned engineers, helping chip companies address workforce shortages and staff turnover.</p><p>Beyond clusters and bookmarks, Vision AI lets designers build custom signals by leveraging their own data. The platform secures customer models and data for exclusive use, making sure sensitive information stays within the company. And by integrating with Siemens\u2019 EDA AI ecosystem, <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> supports generative AI chatbots and reasoning assistants. Designers can ask direct questions\u2014about syntax, about a signal, about the flow\u2014and get prompt\u2014accurate answers, streamlining training and adoption.</p><h2>Real results: speeding analysis and sharing insight</h2><p>Customer feedback from leading IC companies shows the real-world value of AI for full-chip DRC analysis and debug. One company reported that Vision AI reduced their debug effort by at least half\u2014a gain that makes the difference between tapeout and delay. Another noted the platform\u2019s signals algorithm automatically creates the same check groups that experienced users would manually identify, saving not just time but energy.</p><p>Quantitative gains are dramatic. For example, Calibre Vision AI can load and visualize error files significantly faster than traditional debug flows. Figure 3 shows the difference in four different test cases: a results file that took 350 minutes with the traditional flow, took Calibre Vision AI only 31 minutes. In another test case (not shown), it took just five minutes to analyze and cluster 3.2 billion errors from more than 380 rule checks into 17 meaningful groups. Instead of getting lost in gigabytes of error data, designers now spend time solving real problems.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar graph comparing traditional flow vs. Vision AI flow times at various nanometer scales.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2f678\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/bar-graph-comparing-traditional-flow-vs-vision-ai-flow-times-at-various-nanometer-scales.jpg?id=61784294&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Figure 3. Charting the results load time between the traditional DRC debug flow and the Calibre Vision AI flow.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens</small></p><h2>Looking ahead: the future of AI in chip design</h2><p><span></span><span>Today\u2019s chips demand more than incremental improvements in EDA software. As the need for speed, quality and collaboration continues to grow, the story of physical verification will be shaped by smarter, more adaptive technologies. With AI-powered DRC analysis, we see a clear path: a faster and more productive way to find systematic issues, intelligent debug, stronger collaboration and the chance for every designer to make an expert impact.</span></p><p>By combining the creativity of engineers with the speed and insight of AI, platforms like <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/calibre-design/interfaces/vision-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Calibre Vision AI</a> are driving a new productivity curve in full-chip analysis. With these tools, teams don\u2019t just keep up with complexity\u2014they turn it into a competitive advantage.</p><p>At Siemens, the future of chip verification is already taking shape\u2014where intelligence works hand in hand with intuition, and new ideas find their way to silicon faster than ever before. As the industry continues to push boundaries and unlock the next generation of devices, AI will help chip design reach new heights.</p><p><em>For more on Calibre Vision AI and how Siemens is shaping the future of chip design, visit <a href=\"https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">eda.sw.siemens.com</a> and search for Calibre Vision AI.</em></p>"

Today, ship officers rely on tools like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feral-cat-radar-detector\" target=\"_blank\">radar</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.allaboutais.com/index.php/en/\" target=\"_blank\">automatic identification system</a> (AIS), and the <a href=\"https://www.dco.uscg.mil/ECDIS/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Chart Display and Information System</a> (ECDIS) monitor the positions of other vessels and avoid collisions, but much of the <a href=\"https://www.nautinst.org/resources-page/above-and-beyond-practical-ways-to-use-ais-on-board-ship.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">work remains</a> <a href=\"https://www.amsa.gov.au/safety-navigation/navigation-systems/electronic-chart-display-and-information-system#:~:text=ECDIS%20offers%20many%20benefits.,assessing%20situations%2C%20and%20avoiding%20collisions.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">manual</a>.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A screenshot shows views off a ship identifying boats and other hazards in a software platform.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"07f25\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-shows-views-off-a-ship-identifying-boats-and-other-hazards-in-a-software-platform.jpg?id=62084833&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Co-Captain identifies various navigational hazards to a ship\u2019s crew. The crew can also manually tag obstacles or other concerns.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Orca AI</small></p><p>Gross described Co-Captain as the next generation of AIS, the network that transmits basic information like a ship\u2019s position, name, and heading over very high frequency (VHF) signals ranging from 30 to 300 megahertz. Unlike AIS, which tracks only a ship\u2019s position, Co-Captain also monitors onboard conditions. For example, if a ship reports a pitch of 3 degrees and a roll of 5 degrees in rough seas, Co-Captain uses that data to anticipate how current conditions will impact nearby ships, adjusted for their size and design. Co-Captain then sends tailored recommendations to those vessels\u2019 crews.</p><p>\u201cEvery ship acts as a node in a larger network, and each node\u2014the vessel itself\u2014has an onboard AI platform. This platform collects data from multiple sensors in real time,\u201d Gross says. Using cameras and computer vision, the AI model can detect bad weather, low visibility, tall waves, or strong winds, then the platform analyzes the data to provide tailored guidance.</p><p>All data is anonymized. Gross says that a ship\u2019s movements, timing, or route can reveal valuable information. \u201cBy anonymizing the data, Co-Captain can share critical safety alerts such as GPS interference, severe weather, or high traffic without ever exposing which vessel reported it or where it came from.\u201d</p><p>Gross says that Orca AI is working on integrating Co-Captain with more bridge systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/navtex-maritime-safety-broadcasts\" target=\"_blank\">Navigational Telex</a> (NAVTEX) and ECDIS, so that relevant alerts and updates are centralized.</p><p>The company\u2019s long-term goal is to provide real-time notifications focused on the most important events along a ship\u2019s route, giving captains information they can act on quickly to support safer and more efficient operations. The platform is already in use on over 1,200 vessels.</p>"

This is why many of us chose to become engineers: We love to build things.</span></p><p>But especially if you have a private sector job, it\u2019s easy to forget that passion to build as you climb up the corporate ladder. Somewhere between quarterly planning meetings and incident retrospectives, we often lose the joy of creation in our corporate jobs. Large companies require a level of bureaucracy and specialization that is often at odds with building something new.</p><p>That\u2019s why I frequently recommend burned-out engineers to do something very simple: Start a side project. During 15 years working across various tech stacks and companies, this has been the most straightforward, underrated, and powerful way to regain my excitement at work.</p><p>Beyond rekindling a passion for creation, side projects have many other benefits. Side projects let us explore new technologies or problem spaces. We can leverage newer ideas that our companies may be hesitant to adopt. And you don\u2019t need to get buy-in from a manager or explain the business justification. Start using a technology simply because you want to learn about it. </p><p>When you build something through a side project, your depth of understanding is far greater than just following a tutorial or reading about it. I can attribute many of my career opportunities to the projects I\u2019ve built and published outside of my day job. Some of these projects, like my career growth platform Taro, even turn into companies!</p><p>We\u2019ve entered the golden age for side projects because they\u2019re so much more accessible. Compared to a decade ago, it\u2019s significantly easier to research, build, and deploy your creation. Even compared to two years ago, you\u2019re much less likely now to waste hours wrestling with some configuration rabbit hole. Just ask ChatGPT or Gemini for help!</p><p>The benefits of a personal project are real: passion, learning, career growth, and fun. And they\u2019re easier than ever to create.

At home, we even had a few old, nonfunctional phones lying around.\u201d</p><p>While at school, he enjoyed participating in science and math olympiads and exhibitions, he says.</p><p>Taking note of his curiosity and his problem-solving skills, his teachers encouraged him to study engineering. He was most interested in learning electrical engineering because of his interest in the power substations that he and his father checked out.</p><p>\u201cGrowing up in a small town [Dongargarh, which is famous for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambleshwari_Temple\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bamleshwari Temple</a>, a popular Hindu pilgrimage site], I saw how technology could help solve problems and make life better for people,\u201d he says.</p><p>He also became fascinated by the nearby steel factory\u2019s massive machines, its chimneys, and the constant activity around them, he says.</p><p>\u201cI noticed how everything seemed to work together in a coordinated way. Seeing such complex engineering in action at such a young age planted the seed of my interest in technology,\u201d he says. \u201cThis exposure inspired me to pursue electrical engineering as a career.\u201d</p><p>In 2002 he enrolled in the EE program at the <a href=\"https://ccetbhilai.ac.in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Christian College of Engineering and Technology</a>, in Bhilai, India, a 180-minute commute each way by train. He left at 5 a.m. and returned at 6:30 p.m. During his senior year, his family began struggling financially, he says, so his priority was to find a job immediately after graduating to support them.</p><p>In India, universities hold placement events on campus to recruit graduating students. Gupta says he was lucky enough to receive a job offer from the Indian IT company <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahindra_Satyam\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Satyam Computer Services</a>, which is now defunct. He started there in 2006 after earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering and electrical engineering. Satyam assigned him to work on a software program for a financial services company.</p><p>That\u2019s when he pivoted to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vibe-coding\" target=\"_blank\">software engineering</a>.</p><p>Gupta says that although software development wasn\u2019t his preferred career path, it enabled him to support himself and his parents.</p><p>He still has a soft spot for electrical engineering, he says, but he hasn\u2019t changed fields or industries for the past 18 years.</p><p>His time at a variety of financial institutions has allowed him to travel the world to work in other countries including Germany and the United Kingdom, he says. The United States is the fourth country where he has worked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting journey, learning about different work cultures and technologies,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Using AI and machine learning to combat fraud</h2><p>Gupta left Satyam in 2011 to join <a href=\"https://www.mphasis.com/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mphasis</a>, an IT solutions company in Bangalore, India, as a senior software developer focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. After a year, he left for <a href=\"https://www.wipro.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wipro Technologies</a> in Bengaluru. As a technical lead, he was assigned as a consultant for Capital One in Bangalore in an offshore development center. He led a team of 10 employees working on data integration projects including generic frameworks.</p><p>He moved to the United States in 2017 to work as an associate vice president at <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JPMorgan Chase</a> in Jersey City, N.J. He helped create a world-class analytics platform and modernize the bank\u2019s reporting systems. He also worked on systems that use a zero-trust security approach, which he describes as one whereby banks do not automatically trust any user or system. Instead, they verify every transaction.</p><p>\u201cThis greatly reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access,\u201d he says.</p><p>He also developed scalable data partitioning techniques that organize and split large volumes of information into more manageable pieces.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cI believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.\u201d</span></p><p>\u201cThis allows the system to process data more quickly, handle growth without slowing down, and support real-time decision-making,\u201d he says. \u201cThese innovations have helped my organization respond to threats faster.\u201d</p><p>He joined Discover in 2019 and has worked his way up from principal data engineer for the data and analytics group to manager of data engineering. He developed AI-enhanced data pipelines to train models in making real-time, automated decisions.</p><p>AI and machine learning systems can prevent fraudulent transactions by collecting information about a customer\u2019s typical financial habits over time, such as whether banking is done online or through an app, the time of day transactions occur, and the typical amount paid to creditors. The system is then trained to look for anomalies.</p><p>In simple terms, the system assigns a risk score to each transaction, usually on a scale based on patterns it has learned, Gupta says. If the score crosses a certain threshold, the bank might take preventive action. If, for instance, there is an unusual purchase in a location far from where the customer lives, the bank will send the customer a message, looking to verify whether the transaction is legitimate. If the customer does not recognize the purchase, the bank blocks the transaction.</p><h2>Staying connected to tech pros</h2><p>Gupta joined IEEE in 2023 \u201cto connect with a global network of technology professionals, and to stay updated in the latest advancements in engineering and computing,\u201d he says. He was elevated to senior member later that year.</p><p>\u201cMembership has helped me access world-class research through the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6461145\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Xplore Digital Library</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cIt also provided me an opportunity to attend <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/conferences-events\" target=\"_blank\">conferences</a> and share my expertise with the wider engineering community.\u201d</p><h2>AI\u2019s impact on engineering</h2><p>His advice for young engineers is to stay curious and keep learning.</p><p>\u201cTechnology is changing very rapidly,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is working right now might change in six months, so adaptability is your biggest strength.\u201d</p><p>He predicts that AI agents will eventually take over repetitive tasks such as those related to automation, coding, and programming. Where engineers will be most needed, he says, is building AI models and training them.</p><p>\u201cEngineers will find significant opportunities for growth in these areas,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that as AI advances, other innovations will evolve.</p><p>\u201cFocus on solving real problems, not just building solutions for their own sake.</p><p>\u201cBuild your professional network and seek mentors who can guide you through both technical and career challenges.\u201d</p>"

This is why robot laundry folding videos are so popular: we didn\u2019t know how to do that even a few years ago. And it is certainly something that people want! But as </span><a href=\"https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/why-is-everyones-robot-folding-clothes\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a><span> so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry, maybe they can do anything\u2014but that isn\u2019t true, and we\u2019re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.</span></p><p><span>With that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: Here are <strong>my</strong> Humanoid Olympic events. Each event will require us to push the state of the art and unlock new capabilities in robotic manipulation. I will update <a href=\"https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games\" target=\"_blank\">my Substack</a> as folks achieve these milestones, and will mail actual real-life medals to the winners.</span></p><h2>Current State of The Art</h2><p>In order to talk about why each of these challenges pushes the state of the art in robotic manipulation, let\u2019s first talk about what\u2019s working now. What I\u2019m seeing working is learning from demonstration. Generally, folks are using puppeteering interfaces. Most common seems to be two copies of the robot so that a human can grab and move one of them while the other follows, or a virtual reality headset with controllers for hand tracking. They then record some 10-30 second activity hundreds of times over. Fromm that data, a neural network is trained to mimic those examples. This technique has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to get it to lay flat) or have a high state space (like how a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways).</p><p>Thinking about this method of training robots to do things, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but together they form a general trend.</p><ol><li><strong>No force feedback at the wrists.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note2\">2</a></sup> The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperating it, but we don\u2019t yet have good standardized ways of getting high resolution force information to the human teleoperator.</li><li><strong>Limited finger control.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note3\">3</a></sup> It\u2019s hard for the teleoperator (and for a foundation model) to see and control all of a robot\u2019s fingers with much more finesse than just opening and closing them.</li><li><strong>No sense of touch.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note4\">4</a></sup> Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors. Getting anywhere near that kind of sensing out of robot hands in a way that\u2019s usable by a human teleoperator is not currently possible.</li><li><strong>Medium precision.</strong><sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note5\">5</a></sup> Based on videos I\u2019ve seen, I think we\u2019ve got about 1-3 cm precision for tasks.</li></ol><p><span>Now, on to the events!</span></p><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event1\">Event 1: Doors</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event1\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event2\">Event 2: Laundry</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event2\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event3\">Event 3: Tools</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event3\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event4\">Event 4: Fingertip Manipulation</a></h4><h4><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event4\"></a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#event5\">Event 5: Wet Manipulation</a></h4><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"event1\">Event 1: Doors</h2><p>Things like doors are tricky because of the asymmetric forces: you need to grasp and twist the handle or knob quite hard, but if you pull hard outside of the arc of the door you tend to slip your grasp. Also, moving through a door requires whole body manipulation, which is more than I\u2019ve seen from anyone yet.</p><h3>Bronze Medal: Entering a round-knob push door</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"a8487\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fround_door_silent-%25281%2529.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>I think this is very close to state of the art (or maybe it has happened and I didn\u2019t see it). I expect this medal to be claimed by December.</p><h3>Silver Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing push door</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"c83d4\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fpush_selfclose_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>Adding self-closing makes this significantly more challenging because of the force involved, though the lever handle is arguably easier (I just don\u2019t see many round-knob self-closing doors).<sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note6\">6</a></sup></p><h3>Gold Medal: Entering a lever-handle self-closing pull door</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"e5a04\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fpull_selfclose_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>The boss fight of doors.<sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note7\">7</a></sup> You need to either use a second limb to block the door from re-closing, or go through the door fast enough to use dynamics.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"event2\">Event 2: Laundry</h2><p>We\u2019re just getting started on laundry.</p><h3>Bronze Medal: Fold an inside-out T-shirt</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"5f3d2\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Ftshirt_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>This is probably doable using the techniques we have now, but it\u2019s a longer horizon task and might require some tricky two-handed actions to pull the shirt through to right-side-out.<sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note8\">8</a></sup></p><h3>Silver Medal: Turn a sock inside-out</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"7da32\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Freverse_sock_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>I think both the hand-insertion and the action of pinching the inside of the sock are interesting new challenges.</p><h3>Gold Medal: Hang a men\u2019s dress-shirt</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"c526e\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fdress_shirt_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>The size medium shirt starts unbuttoned with one sleeve inside-out. It must end up on the hanger correctly with the sleeve fixed and at least one button buttoned. I think this one is 3-10 years out, both because buttons are really hard and because getting a strong, dexterous hand small enough to fit into a sleeve is going to be hard.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"event3\">Event 3: Tools</h2><p>Humans are creatures of technology and, as useful as our hands are, we mostly use them to hold and manipulate tools. This challenge is about building the strength and dexterity to use basic tools.</p><h3>Bronze Medal: Window cleaner and paper towels</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"5e7b4\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fwindex_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>The  window cleaning fluid bottle is super forgiving in terms of how you grasp it, but you do need to independently articulate a finger, and the finger has to be pretty strong to get fluid to spray out.<sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note9\">9</a></sup></p><h3>Silver Medal: Peanut butter sandwiches</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"69db9\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fsandwich.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>The challenge here is to pick up a knife and then adjust the grasp to be strong and stable enough to scoop and spread the peanut butter. Humans use a \u2018strong tool grasp\u2019 for all kinds of activities, but it\u2019s very challenging for robot grippers.<sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note1\">10</a></sup></p><h3>Gold Medal: Use a key</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"13bb4\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fkeys_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>A keyring with at least 2 keys and a keychain is dropped into the robot\u2019s waiting palm/gripper<em>. Without putting the keys down,</em> get the correct key aligned and inserted and turned in a lock. This requires very challenging in-hand manipulation, along with high precision forceful interaction.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"event4\">Event 4: Fingertip Manipulation</h2><p>We humans do all kinds of in-hand manipulation using the structure of our hands to manipulate things that we are holding.</p><h3>Bronze Medal: Roll matched socks</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"1cd07\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Froll_socks_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>Requires dexterity and precision, but not very much force.</p><h3>Silver Medal: Use a dog poop bag</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"e297b\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fmock_poo_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>When I use a dog-bag I have to do a slide-between-the-fingertips action to separate the opening of the bag which is a tricky forceful interaction as well as a motion that I\u2019m not even sure most robot hands are capable of. Also tricky is tearing off a single bag rather than pulling a big long spool out of the holder, if you choose to use one.<sup><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#note1\">11</a></sup></p><h3>Gold Medal: Peel an orange</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"4751c\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Forange_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>Done without external tools. This is super tricky: high force yet high precision fingertip actions.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"event5\">Event 5: Wet Manipulation</h2><p>If you sit down and write out what you might want a robot to do for you, a lot of tasks end up being kind of wet. Robots usually don\u2019t like being wet, but we\u2019ll have to change that if we want to have them clean for us. And wet things can be difficult to grasp and use.</p><h3>Bronze Medal: Wipe a counter-top with a sponge</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"50262\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fsponge_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>Mildly damp, but with exciting risk of getting the whole hand in the water if you aren\u2019t careful. Probably requires at least splash resistant hands (or a whole bunch of spares).</p><h3>Silver Medal: Clean peanut butter off your manipulator</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"35dae\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fpeanutbutter_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>This one naturally follows after the sandwich one. Water everywhere. Seems like an important skill to have after a few hours collecting training data on the dog-poop task.</p><h3>Gold Medal: Use a sponge to wash grease off a pan in a sink</h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-html5_video ieee-video-vertical\"> <video class=\"rm-shortcode\" controls=\"\" id=\"83b69\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/runner%2Fpan_silent.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Benjie Holson</small></p><p>Water, soap, grease, and an unpleasant task no one wants to do.</p><h2><span>Terms and Conditions</span></h2><p>To be eligible to win, a general purpose manipulator robot running autonomously must demonstrate successful task completion in a real-time video with no cuts. <span>You are allowed a maximum of 10x the time I took to do each task (a 4 second task can take your robot up to 40 seconds). I reserve the right to be arbitrary in deciding if things aren\u2019t following in the spirit of the challenge.

In 2008 I worked on </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=40416cf4ac9e8052&amp;udm=7&amp;q=anybots+monty&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjuwvuU27uPAxVSH0QIHbJdEP8Q8ccDKAR6BAgYEAY&amp;biw=1415&amp;bih=1059&amp;dpr=2#fpstate=ive&amp;ip=1&amp;vld=cid:41ab6a35,vid:pdEuFhJit0o,st:0\" target=\"_blank\">this robot</a><span> which also had 22 degrees of freedom and controlling it was crazy hard (as was keeping all the cables correctly tensioned). The other hand was a big two-finger gripper which I ended up using for most teleop tasks.</span></p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note4\"><sup>4</sup> Meta has been working with some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyUZX-lCj4M\" target=\"_blank\">in-finger vision systems</a> which seem cool.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note5\"><sup>5</sup> This is likely more a teleoperation precision limitation than a model limitation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sZ2c2EMNcg\" target=\"_blank\">Here is a video</a> of Generalist Robotics doing sub-cm precision tasks. <span>I love that hockey sticks have become the traditional \u201cmess with a robot\u201d tool even for ridiculous things like this.</span></p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note6\"><sup>6</sup> Yes, I did wear this at my workplace in order to get this video. You\u2019re welcome.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note7\"><sup>7</sup> I have programmed (not trained) a general purpose mobile manipulator to pass through a self-close pull door, but it took over 4 minutes (disqualified for taking too long) and required a special doorstop. Also the video isn\u2019t public (also disqualified). Also it\u2019s really tacky to put up a competition and award yourself gold before it even starts.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note8\"><sup>8</sup> T-shirt starts fully inside-out in a wad. Finishes tolerably folded, right-side out.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note9\"><sup>9</sup> <span>You must spray 3 good spritzes on the window, and wipe them up with paper towels so there are no ugly streaks. Paper towels start on the paper-towel roll, not pre-torn and pre-wadded.</span></p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note10\"><sup>10</sup> Peanut butter jar starts and ends closed. Sandwich should be cut in half. (Triangle or rectangular cuts are both acceptable, though your three-year-old might disagree).</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"note11\"><sup>11</sup> Mock poo allowed. Bag starts on the roll but can be in a standard dog-bag holder, held by the robot.</p><p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games\" target=\"_blank\">General Robots</a>, Benjie Holson\u2019s Substack about making a general purpose robot company.</em></p>"
