In our benchmark estimate, the total effective tax rate\u2014all taxes paid relative to economic income\u2014of the top 0.0002% (approximately the \u201ctop 400\u201d) averaged 24% in 2018\u20132020 compared with 30% for the full population and 45% for top labor income earners. This lower total effective tax rate on the wealthiest is substantially driven by low taxable individual income relative to economic income. First, the C-corporations owned by the wealthiest distributed relatively little in dividends, limiting their individual income tax unless they sell their stocks. Second, top-owned passthrough businesses reported negative taxable income on average in spite of positive book income, further limiting their individual income tax. The top-400 effective tax rate fell from 30% in 2010\u20132017 to 24% in 2018\u20132020, explained both by a smaller share of business income being taxed and by that income being subject to lower tax rates. Estate and gift taxes contributed relatively little to their effective tax rate. Top-400 decedents paid 0.8% of their wealth in estate tax when married and 7% when single. Annual charitable contributions equalled 0.6% of wealth and 11% of economic income in 2018\u201320."

We find that outsourcing legalization persistently reallocated jobs from older incumbent guards to younger entrants. Total employment of guards and their entry from informality persistently increased, while average demographic-adjusted wages remained constant. Meanwhile, a wave of occupational layoffs displaced some incumbent guards from high-wage firms. The evidence suggests that the rise of non-core activity outsourcing reduced labor market frictions, facilitated by firm-level economies of scale in human resources and spillovers to non-adopting firms."

We assemble a new workforce development dataset spanning over 1.6 million job training participation spells from all US Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act programs from 2012\u20132023 linked with occupational measures of AI exposure. Using earnings records observed before and after training, we compare high AI exposure trainees to a matched sample of similar workers who only received job search assistance. We find that AI-exposed workers have high earnings returns from training that are only 25% lower than the returns for low AI exposure workers. However, training participants who target AI-intensive occupations face a penalty for doing so, with 29% lower returns than AI-exposed workers pursuing more general training. We estimate that between 25% to 40% of occupations are \u201cAI retrainable\u201d as measured by its workers receiving higher pay for moving to more AI-intensive occupations\u2014a large magnitude given the relatively low-income sample of displaced workers.

We generalize the consumption-equivalent variation of Lucas (1987) to a multi-agent setting, asking: how much can the consumption-possibility set shrink while keeping every agent at least as well off as in their status-quo allocation? The resulting scalar \u2014 resources left over after compensating everyone \u2014 is our measure of aggregate efficiency. Efficiency rises whenever the same status-quo welfare can be achieved with fewer resources. We show how to convert this problem into an equivalent utility-maximization problem, enabling the use of tools and results normally applicable only in representative agent settings. We characterize changes in aggregate efficiency in terms of observables, like expenditures and price elasticities, and apply our results to study, among other things, the effects of productivity shocks, the costs of misallocation, and the gains from trade, both with and without costly redistribution."

His earliest memories are of welding with his grandfather and knitting with his grandmother\u2014unusual hobbies for a typical 4-year-old, though not in Mann\u2019s family. His father, who worked for a men\u2019s clothing company, supplemented his income by buying and renovating houses, long before the concept of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/house-flip.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flipping houses</a> became widespread.</p><p>\u201cWe were always living in a house under construction,\u201d Mann recalls. \u201cI used to help my dad fix things when I was 4 or 5\u2014hammer in my hand\u2014normal stuff.\u201d His grandfather, a refrigeration engineer, taught him how to weld. By age 6, he was wiring and building homemade radios. By the time he was 8, he had started a neighborhood repair business, fixing televisions and radios.</p><p>\u201cIn a sense, preschool for me was learning engineering and science,\u201d Mann says with a laugh. \u201cI grew up putting together wood, metal, or fabric. I knew how to make things at a very young age.\u201d</p><h2>Learning to see what others miss</h2><p>When Mann was 12 years old, his father brought home a broken oscillograph (an early version of the oscilloscope, used to display variations in voltage or current as visual waveforms). It turned out to be a defining moment in his life. Too impatient to accept that the waveform dot on the machine\u2019s display moved only up and down instead of both vertically and horizontally, Mann invented a way to push its image through physical space.</p><p>He placed the oscillograph\u2014which he now keeps on a shelf in his laboratory\u2014on a board mounted on roller skate wheels. He connected the device to a police radar and rolled it back and forth. When he realized the machine\u2019s motion, combined with the dot\u2019s vertical movement, created visible waveforms of the radar\u2019s signals, as a function of space rather than time, he unknowingly made a revolutionary discovery.</p><p>Later he would describe that merging of physical and virtual worlds as \u201cextended reality\u201d\u2014a concept that underlies today\u2019s<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-alliance-advancing-augmented-reality\" target=\"_self\"> AR</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/extended-reality\" target=\"_self\">XR</a> technologies. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time Mann\u2019s curiosity turned a problem into an opportunity.</p><p>Decades later, on the main floor of his Toronto home, he co-founded <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/pages/team\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InteraXon</a>, the Toronto-based company behind the <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqc3ta8hB6lNjQIi_jbX_Go5LphTzvrPTwE1tsykr5bg8XsWn-I\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muse brain-sensing headband</a>, used to help people manage sleep, stress, and mental health.</p><p>Mann shares legendary 1970s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/26/business/silicon-valley-tech-xerox-parc-sri.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xerox PARC</a> researcher <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kay_3972189.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kay</a>\u2019s belief that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2017/04/04/7-steps-for-inventing-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The best way to predict the future is to invent it</a>.\u201d Mann, however, adds: \u201cSometimes you invent it by simply refusing to accept the limitations of the present.\u201d</p><h2>A member of MIT\u2019s Media Lab</h2><p> In high school, Mann won several math competitions designed to challenge students at university level. In 1982 he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.mcmaster.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McMaster University</a>, in Hamilton, Ontario, to pursue a degree in engineering physics (an interdisciplinary program that combines physics, mathematics, and engineering principles). As an undergraduate, Mann was already experimenting with early prototypes of wearable computers\u2014head-mounted displays, body-worn cameras, and portable computing systems that predated mainstream mobile tech by decades.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rehmi Post, Thad Starner, Steve Mann and Professor Alex Pentland donning wearable computers that resemble electronic eyeglasses in the 1990s.

He continued his studies at McMaster to earn a second bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1989, then a master\u2019s degree in engineering in 1991.</p><p>He then enrolled in a doctoral program at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>, where he joined its renowned <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Media Lab</a>, a hotbed for unconventional research blending technology, design, and the human experience. He formalized and expanded his ideas around wearable computing, wearable computer vision systems, and wearable AI. He also published some of the earliest academic papers that described the concept of sousveillance.</p><p>He completed his Ph.D. in media arts and sciences in 1997.</p><p>Mann\u2019s doctoral research contributed foundational concepts and hardware that influenced future smart glasses and devices for life logging, the practice of creating a digital record of one\u2019s daily life.

He says he is equally as fascinated by how technology interacts with the natural world as he is by how to remove barriers between the physical world and virtual world.</p><p><span>His interests connect to what he calls \u201cvironmentalism,\u201d which regards technology as a boundary between our environment and our \u201cvironment\u201d (ourselves). This gives rise to his vision of \u201cmersive\u201d technologies that link humans not just to each other but also to the environment around them.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span></span>\u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school.

He credits the organization with connecting him to pioneers like <a href=\"https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/news/simon-haykin-receives-ieee-medal-for-advancing-radar-technologies/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Haykin</a>, the radar visionary he met at McMaster while he was in high school.

He has served as an organizer, session chair, and program committee member for IEEE conferences related to wearable computing and pervasive sensing.</p><p>In 1997 he helped found the<a href=\"https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2024/iswc-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Symposium on Wearable Computers</a>, and numerous other wearable computing symposia, conferences, and events.</p><p>He has given keynote talks and presented papers on topics including sousveillance, ubiquitous computing, and other humanistic aspects of technology at the <a href=\"https://attend.ieee.org/istas-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://percom.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications</a>.</p><p>His contributions include influential papers in IEEE journals, especially various IEEE Transactions and Computer Society magazines.</p><p>Probably his most well-known paper is \u201c<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/566147\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wearable Computing</a>.\u201d Published in <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=PER300-PRT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Computer</em></em></a> magazine in October 1997, the seminal work outlined the structure and vision for wearable computing as a formal research field. He also contributed articles on sousveillance\u2014exploring the intersection of technology, ethics, and human rights\u2014in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=44\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>IEEE Technology and Society Magazine</em></em></a>.</p><p>He has collaborated with other IEEE members to develop frameworks for <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wearable computing standards</a>, particularly around human-computer interfaces and privacy considerations.</p><h2>Forever the inventor</h2><p>Mann continues to teach, run his lab, and test new frontiers of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wearables\" target=\"_self\">wearable devices</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-clothing-cornell\" target=\"_self\"> smart clothing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.xrtoday.com/mixed-reality/the-hottest-trends-in-immersive-environments-for-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">immersive environments</a>. He\u2019s still driven, he says, by the same forces that powered his backyard experiments as a child: curiosity and passion.</p><p>For students who hope to follow in his footsteps, Mann\u2019s advice is simple: \u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school. Don\u2019t define yourself by the classes you took or the jobs you had. Define yourself by what you love so much you\u2019d do it \u201ceven if no teachers or managers were demanding it\u201d. He adds that, \u201cAI can replace a walking encyclopedia. It can\u2019t replace passion.\u201d</p><p>Mann says he has no plans to retire. If anything, he says, his most productive years are yet to come.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m a late bloomer,\u201d he says, chuckling at the irony. \u201cI was fixing radios when I was 8, but my best work? That\u2019s going to happen between 65 and 85.\u201d</p>"

This was the \u201coveremployed\u201d craze, and the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/\" target=\"_blank\">/r/overemployed</a> subreddit ballooned to nearly half a million members. The dream was to earn double the income, accelerate the path to financial freedom, and subtly defy corporate America.</span></p><p>As we\u2019ve come back to physical offices, overemployment has become less common, but I was shocked when an engineer recently told me he was working two full-time jobs. He was enjoying the extra pay, but he was also stressed out about keeping secrets from both his managers. Beyond the anxiety of juggling two jobs, overemployment is clearly a career-limiting move for engineers.</p><p>Beyond the obvious contractual breaches\u2014most full-time employment agreements explicitly forbid this kind of moonlighting without consent\u2014overemployment is simply a bad idea.</p><p>With overemployment, you\u2019re essentially trying to \u201cget by\u201d in two roles. Instead of building strong relationships and genuinely contributing, you must perform a delicate balancing act, hoping neither employer catches on. This is incredibly short-sighted. Your career growth isn\u2019t about accumulating company logos; it\u2019s about the skills you acquire, the impact you make, and the people who can advocate for you. You\u2019ll grow exponentially faster\u2014and frankly, have a lot more fun\u2014 if you commit fully to one role.</p><p>The temporary financial bump of overemployment comes at a steep price; your coworkers will likely stop trusting you. This concern increases as you become more senior. At the Staff or Principal Engineer level, your <span>job</span> will depend on the relationships you\u2019ve built and your ability to work with (and through) other people. Overemployment, especially when it\u2019s a covert operation, is a fundamental violation of trust. How can you provide meaningful mentorship or truly collaborate when you\u2019re hiding a massive part of your professional life? I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible.</p><p>The ultimate career hack is quite simple: commit fully to a <span>job</span> where you\u2019re surrounded by smart coworkers in a company that\u2019s growing rapidly.

This will change many things about what\u2019s often described as the \u201cCIA triad\u201d of digital security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Of those three features, data integrity will become of paramount importance.</p><h3>Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Blue rocket launching near a tower with an explosive burst overhead.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8b9a4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blue-rocket-launching-near-a-tower-with-an-explosive-burst-overhead.png?id=61453398&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A 64-bit velocity calculation was converted to</span> a 16-bit output, causing an error called overflow. The corrupted data triggered catastrophic course corrections that forced the US $370 million rocket to self-destruct.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>When we have agency in digital spaces, we naturally maintain their integrity\u2014protecting them from deterioration and shaping them with intention. But in territories controlled by distant platforms, where we\u2019re merely temporary visitors, that connection frays. A disconnect emerges between those who benefit from data and those who bear the consequences of compromised integrity. Like homeowners who care deeply about maintaining the property they own, users in the Web 3.0 paradigm will become stewards of their personal digital spaces.</p><p>This will be critical in a world where <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-agents\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> don\u2019t just answer our questions but act on our behalf. These agents may execute financial transactions, coordinate complex workflows, and autonomously operate critical infrastructure, making decisions that ripple through entire industries. As digital agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the question is no longer whether we will trust AI but what that trust is built upon. In the new age we\u2019re entering, the foundation isn\u2019t intelligence or efficiency\u2014it\u2019s integrity.</p><h2>What Is Data Integrity?</h2><p>In information systems, integrity is the guarantee that data will not be modified without authorization, and that all transformations are verifiable throughout the data\u2019s life cycle. While availability ensures that systems are running and confidentiality prevents unauthorized access, integrity focuses on whether information is accurate, unaltered, and consistent across systems and over time.</p><h3>NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract satellite orbiting orange planet on a dark blue background with scattered dots.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"016f0\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-satellite-orbiting-orange-planet-on-a-dark-blue-background-with-scattered-dots.png?id=61453435&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br />Lockheed Martin\u2019s software calculated thrust in pound-seconds, while NASA\u2019s navigation software expected newton-seconds. The failure caused the $328 million spacecraft to burn up in the Mars atmosphere.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It\u2019s a new idea. The undo button, which prevents accidental data loss, is an integrity feature. So is the reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state. Checksums are an integrity feature; so are verifications of network transmission.</p><p>Without integrity, security measures can backfire. Encrypting corrupted data just locks in errors. Systems that score high marks for availability but spread misinformation just become amplifiers of risk.</p><p>All IT systems require some form of data integrity, but the need for it is especially pronounced in two areas today. First: Internet of Things devices interact directly with the physical world, so corrupted input or output can result in real-world harm. Second: AI systems are only as good as the integrity of the data they\u2019re trained on, and the integrity of their decision-making processes. If that foundation is shaky, the results will be too.</p><p>Integrity manifests in four key areas. The first, <em>input integrity,</em> concerns the quality and authenticity of data entering a system. When this fails, consequences can be severe. In 2021, <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook\u2019s global outage</a> was triggered by a single mistaken command\u2014an input error missed by automated systems. Protecting input integrity requires robust authentication of data sources, cryptographic signing of sensor data, and diversity in input channels for cross-validation.</p><p>The second issue is <em>processing integrity,</em> which ensures that systems transform inputs into outputs correctly. In 2003, the <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Documents/August_2003_Blackout_Final_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.\u2013Canada blackout</a> affected 55 million people when a control-room process failed to refresh properly, resulting in damages exceeding US $6 billion. Safeguarding processing integrity means formally verifying algorithms, cryptographically protecting models, and monitoring systems for anomalous behavior.</p><h3>Microsoft\u2019s Tay Chatbot (2016)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract robot illustration with orange eyes, yellow face, blue-black mouth and beige background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fca2a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-robot-illustration-with-orange-eyes-yellow-face-blue-black-mouth-and-beige-background.png?id=61454030&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Released on Twitter, Microsoft</span>\u2019s AI chatbot was vulnerable to a \u201crepeat after me\u201d command, which meant it would echo any offensive content fed to it.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><em>Storage integrity</em> covers the correctness of information as it\u2019s stored and communicated. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration was <a href=\"https://www.thestack.technology/faa-outage-cause-notam-database-file-not-cyber/\" target=\"_blank\">forced to halt</a> all U.S. departing flights because of a corrupted database file. Addressing this risk requires cryptographic approaches that make any modification computationally infeasible without detection, distributed storage systems to prevent single points of failure, and rigorous backup procedures.</p><p>Finally, <em>contextual integrity</em> addresses the appropriate flow of information according to the norms of its larger context. It\u2019s not enough for data to be accurate; it must also be used in ways that respect expectations and boundaries. For example, if a smart speaker listens in on casual family conversations and uses the data to build advertising profiles, that action would violate the expected boundaries of data collection. Preserving contextual integrity requires clear data-governance policies, principles that limit the use of data to its intended purposes, and mechanisms for enforcing information-flow constraints.</p><p>As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions with reduced human oversight, all these dimensions of integrity become critical.</p><h2>The Need for Integrity in Web 3.0</h2><p>As the digital landscape has shifted from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and now evolves toward Web 3.0, we\u2019ve seen each era bring a different emphasis in the <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad\" target=\"_blank\">CIA triad</a> of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><h3>Boeing 737 MAX (2018)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Cartoon airplane crashes into water; orange 'X' symbol above indicates failure.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8f82b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/cartoon-airplane-crashes-into-water-orange-x-symbol-above-indicates-failure.png?id=61454071&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Input integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Faulty sensor data caused a</span>n automated flight-control system to repeatedly push the airplane\u2019s nose down, leading to a fatal crash.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Returning to our home metaphor: When simply having shelter is what matters most, availability takes priority\u2014the house must exist and be functional. Once that foundation is secure, confidentiality becomes important\u2014you need locks on your doors to keep others out. Only after these basics are established do you begin to consider integrity, to ensure that what\u2019s inside the house remains trustworthy, unaltered, and consistent over time.</p><p>Web 1.0 of the 1990s prioritized making information available. Organizations digitized their content, putting it out there for anyone to access. In Web 2.0, the Web of today, platforms for e-commerce, social media, and cloud computing prioritize confidentiality, as personal data has become the Internet\u2019s currency.</p><p>Somehow, integrity was largely lost along the way. In our current Web architecture, where control is centralized and removed from individual users, the concern for integrity has diminished. The massive social media platforms have created environments where no one feels responsible for the truthfulness or quality of what circulates.</p><h3>SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack (2020)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Capitol building with skull emblem and coding patterns, symbolizing cybersecurity threats.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e236\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/capitol-building-with-skull-emblem-and-coding-patterns-symbolizing-cybersecurity-threats.png?id=61454168&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Russian hackers compromised </span>the process that SolarWinds used to package its software, injecting malicious code that was distributed to 18,000 customers, including nine federal agencies. The hack remained undetected for 14 months.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Web 3.0 is poised to change this dynamic by returning ownership to the data owners. This is not speculative; it\u2019s already emerging. For example, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol behind decentralized social networks like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, combines content sharing with built-in attribution. Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solid protocol</a> restructures the Web around personal data pods with granular access controls.</p><p>These technologies prioritize integrity through cryptographic verification that proves authorship, decentralized architectures that eliminate vulnerable central authorities, machine-readable semantics that make meaning explicit\u2014structured data formats that allow computers to understand participants and actions, such as \u201cAlice performed surgery on Bob\u201d\u2014and transparent governance where rules are visible to all. As AI systems become more autonomous, communicating directly with one another via standardized protocols, these integrity controls will be essential for maintaining trust.</p><h2>Why Data Integrity Matters in AI</h2><p>For AI systems, integrity is crucial in four domains. The first is decision quality. With AI increasingly contributing to decision-making in health care, justice, and finance, the integrity of both data and models\u2019 actions directly impact human welfare. Accountability is the second domain. Understanding the causes of failures requires reliable logging, audit trails, and system records.</p><h3>ChatGPT Data Leak (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Unlocked orange padlock with phone displaying keyhole; purple background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b856\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/unlocked-orange-padlock-with-phone-displaying-keyhole-purple-background.png?id=61454212&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A bug in </span>OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT mixed different users\u2019 conversation histories. Users suddenly had other people\u2019s chats appear in their interfaces with no way to prove the conversations weren\u2019t theirs.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The third domain is the security relationships between components. Many authentication systems rely on the integrity of identity information and cryptographic keys. If these elements are compromised, malicious agents could impersonate trusted systems, potentially creating cascading failures as AI agents interact and make decisions based on corrupted credentials.</p><p>Finally, integrity matters in our public definitions of safety. Governments worldwide are introducing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\" target=\"_self\">rules for AI</a> that focus on data accuracy, transparent algorithms, and verifiable claims about system behavior. Integrity provides the basis for meeting these legal obligations.</p><p>The importance of integrity only grows as AI systems are entrusted with more critical applications and operate with less human oversight. While people can sometimes detect integrity lapses, autonomous systems may not only miss warning signs\u2014they may exponentially increase the severity of breaches. Without assurances of integrity, organizations will not trust AI systems for important tasks, and we won\u2019t realize the full potential of AI.</p><h2>How to Build AI Systems With Integrity</h2><p>Imagine an AI system as a home we\u2019re building together. The integrity of this home doesn\u2019t rest on a single security feature but on the thoughtful integration of many elements: solid foundations, well-constructed walls, clear pathways between rooms, and shared agreements about how spaces will be used.</p><h3>Midjourney Bias (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract digital screen with colorful user icons and communication symbols.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"59897\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-digital-screen-with-colorful-user-icons-and-communication-symbols.png?id=61454522&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Contextual integrity failure</strong> <br />Users discovered that the AI image generator often produced biased images of people, such as showing white men as CEOs regardless of the prompt. The AI tool didn\u2019t accurately reflect the context requested by the users.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We begin by laying the cornerstone: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\" target=\"_self\">cryptographic verification</a>. Digital signatures ensure that data lineage is traceable, much like a title deed proves ownership. Decentralized identifiers act as digital passports, allowing components to prove identity independently. When the front door of our AI home recognizes visitors through their own keys rather than through a vulnerable central doorman, we create resilience in the architecture of trust.</p><p>Formal verification methods enable us to mathematically prove the structural integrity of critical components, ensuring that systems can withstand pressures placed upon them\u2014especially in high-stakes domains where lives may depend on an AI\u2019s decision.</p><p>Just as a well-designed home creates separate spaces, trustworthy AI systems are built with thoughtful compartmentalization. We don\u2019t rely on a single barrier but rather layer them to limit how problems in one area might affect others. Just as a kitchen fire is contained by fire doors and independent smoke alarms, training data is separated from the AI\u2019s inferences and output to limit the impact of any single failure or breach.</p><p>Throughout this AI home, we build transparency into the design: The equivalent of large windows that allow light into every corner is clear pathways from input to output. We install monitoring systems that continuously check for weaknesses, alerting us before small issues become catastrophic failures.</p><h3>Prompt Injection Attacks (2023\u20132024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Stylized blue bug on screen with keyboard; sad face in orange circle connected by line.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c6e75\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/stylized-blue-bug-on-screen-with-keyboard-sad-face-in-orange-circle-connected-by-line.png?id=61454587&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input integrity failure</strong> <br />Attackers embedded hidden prompts in emails, documents, and websites that hijacked AI assistants, causing them to treat malicious instructions as legitimate commands.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>But a home isn\u2019t just a physical structure, it\u2019s also the agreements we make about how to live within it. Our governance frameworks act as these shared understandings. Before welcoming new residents, we provide them with certification standards. Just as landlords conduct credit checks, we conduct integrity assessments to evaluate newcomers. And we strive to be good neighbors, aligning our community agreements with broader societal expectations.</p><p>Perhaps most important, we recognize that our AI home will shelter diverse individuals with varying needs. Our governance structures must reflect this diversity, bringing many stakeholders to the table. A truly trustworthy system cannot be designed only for its builders but must serve anyone authorized to eventually call it home.</p><p>That\u2019s how we\u2019ll create AI systems worthy of trust: not by blindly believing in their perfection but because we\u2019ve intentionally designed them with integrity controls at every level.</p><h2>A Challenge of Language</h2><p>Unlike other properties of security, like \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cprivate,\u201d we don\u2019t have a common adjective form for \u201cintegrity.\u201d This makes it hard to talk about it. It turns out that there is a word in English: \u201cintegrous.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recorded the word used in the mid-1600s but now <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/integrous_adj?tab=factsheet&amp;tl=true#210671\" target=\"_blank\">declares it obsolete</a>.</p><h3>CrowdStrike\u00a0Outage (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Three panels: people on escalator, government building, hospital with red cross flag.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"031f4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-panels-people-on-escalator-government-building-hospital-with-red-cross-flag.png?id=61454608&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Processing integrity failure</strong><br />A faulty software update from CrowdStrike caused 8.5 million Windows computers worldwide to crash\u2014grounding flights, shutting down hospitals, and disrupting banks.

We need the ability to describe a system with integrity. We must be able to talk about integrous systems design.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><p>Ensuring integrity in AI presents formidable challenges. As models grow larger and more complex, maintaining integrity without sacrificing performance becomes difficult. Integrity controls often require computational resources that can slow systems down\u2014particularly challenging for real-time applications. Another concern is that emerging technologies like quantum computing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2668949802\" target=\"_self\">threaten current cryptographic protections</a>. Additionally, the distributed nature of modern AI\u2014which relies on vast ecosystems of libraries, frameworks, and services\u2014presents a large attack surface.</p><p>Beyond technology, integrity depends heavily on social factors. Companies often prioritize speed to market over robust integrity controls. Development teams may lack specialized knowledge for implementing these controls, and may find it particularly difficult to integrate them into legacy systems. And while some governments have begun establishing regulations for aspects of AI, we need worldwide alignment on governance for AI integrity.</p><h3>Voice-Clone Scams (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"People holding phones, speech bubble showing happiness, money, and skull emoji.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"26ea5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/people-holding-phones-speech-bubble-showing-happiness-money-and-skull-emoji.png?id=61454716&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input and processing integrity failure</strong><br />Scammers used AI-powered voice-cloning tools to mimic the voices of victims\u2019 family members, tricking people into sending money. These scams succeeded because neither phone systems nor victims identified the AI-generated voice as fake.<br /></p><p><span>Addressing these challenges requires sustained research into verifying and enforcing integrity, as well as recovering from breaches. Priority areas include fault-tolerant algorithms for distributed learning, verifiable computation on encrypted data, techniques that maintain integrity despite adversarial attacks, and standardized metrics for certification. We also need interfaces that clearly communicate integrity status to human overseers.</span></p><p>As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the stakes for integrity have never been higher. We are entering an era where machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous agents will operate with reduced human oversight and make decisions with profound impacts.</p><p>The good news is that the tools for building systems with integrity already exist. What\u2019s needed is a shift in mind-set: from treating integrity as an afterthought to accepting that it\u2019s the core organizing principle of AI security.</p><p>The next era of technology will be defined not by what AI can do, but by whether we can trust it to know or especially to do what\u2019s right. Integrity\u2014in all its dimensions\u2014will determine the answer. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

IPF is a chronic disease that develops when lung tissue becomes too thick, causing permanent scarring in the lungs, according to the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>. The condition makes it hard to breathe. Despite numerous hospital visits and CT scans, her grandfather was diagnosed with the condition too late, leading al-Mahrouqi to want to improve IPF diagnosis methods.</p><p>\u201cRadiologists look for things like tiny, honey-shaped complex sites or faint, hazy areas called ground-glass opacities in the lungs,\u201d al-Mahrouqi says. \u201cThese same patterns also show up in other diseases, like nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and early-stage lung cancer. This often leads to a misdiagnosis.\u201d</p><p>She developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system that uses a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization process, enhancing CT images by amplifying contrast and limiting image grain. Her prototype also uses six different pretrained convolutional neural networks that classify fibrosis patterns and nodule types\u2014malignant, benign, or normal\u2014to provide an earlier diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cThis prototype is unique because it converts classification and enhancement into a single diagnostic tool,\u201d al-Mahrouqi says.

Encased in titanium, the batteries for these devices contained a radioactive isotope\u2014typically about a tenth of a gram of plutonium-238\u2014and could operate for decades without maintenance. The invention provided relief to a population of people who previously needed surgery every few years to change out their pacemaker\u2019s chemical battery.</p><p>As time went on, though, the whereabouts of these radioactive tickers became increasingly difficult to track. In the United States, the devices were supposed to be returned to the U.S. Department of Energy for plutonium recovery. But often, that didn\u2019t happen. Doctors changed jobs, manufacturers went out of business, patients died, and families forgot about their loved one\u2019s pacemaker. Too often, the radioactive material landed in crematoriums and coffins.</p><p>Uncomfortable with the situation, regulators worldwide nixed the devices. The last known nuclear-powered pacemaker was implanted in 1988. After that, aside from a few specialty uses, such as deep-space probes and Siberian lighthouses, development and deployment of nuclear batteries effectively came to a halt.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Two human hands using instruments to manipulate the pieces of a small metal object labeled as radioactive\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cea8b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Medtronic\u2019s 1970 Laurens-Alcatel pulse generator powered pacemakers with plutonium-238. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Smith Collection/Getty Images </small></p><p>Technology never truly dies, and nuclear batteries are no exception. Research <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-daintiest-dynamos\" target=\"_self\">grew active again after 2000</a>, although it lacked commercial translation. But over the last year, a host of companies and research groups around the world have announced advances that they say will invigorate the technology and extend its use to robots, drones, sensors, and solar farms, as well as spacecraft and biomedical implants.</p><p>The new groups are employing modern, more-exotic technology that goes beyond the designs of the past, allowing them to pursue the finest nuclear batteries ever made. As with the first generation, the allure of nuclear batteries is still their extraordinarily long life-spans: several decades and, with proper fuel choice, possibly centuries. They could also deliver more energy in packages that weigh less than those of chemical batteries.</p><p>The question is, who\u2019s going to buy them? I\u2019ve been involved in this sector for nearly 40 years as a nuclear engineer, professor, and consultant. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed: The technology works, it has many advantages over chemical batteries, and it can be utilized safely. But what very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. Part of the problem is that there is no good solution to the need to track these sources and make sure they are disposed of properly at the end of the battery\u2019s life.</p><p>There are more companies working out the challenges now than I\u2019ve ever seen in my career, and that\u2019s good for the field\u2014it helps ground the academic research. And it gives me hope that this could be the moment when nuclear batteries finally flourish.</p><h2>How Do Nuclear Batteries Work?  </h2><p>The term \u201cnuclear batteries\u201d may evoke images of tiny nuclear reactors, but that\u2019s not how they work. Nuclear batteries don\u2019t split atoms with neutron bombardment. Instead, they capture energy in the form of radiation that\u2019s spontaneously released when atomic nuclei decay.</p><p>Most research groups developing nuclear batteries are focused on harnessing energy from radioactive isotopes of nickel and hydrogen. In many nuclear battery designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation released by the radioisotopes\u2019 nuclei and convert it to an electric current, much like a solar cell does. In other designs, thermoelectric devices convert the heat produced by the emitted radiation to electricity. So \u201cradioisotope power source\u201d is a better descriptor than \u201cnuclear battery,\u201d but for ease of language, I\u2019ll use these terms interchangeably.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A coin-shaped metal object displaying a radioactive symbol and other details about its contents \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7d529\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Infinity Power uses a novel electrochemical process to convert the radioactive decay of nickel-63 into electricity. The company says it can scale the technology from microwatts to megawatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Infinity Power </small></p><p>On the heels of some laboratory successes, researchers are racing to commercialize these devices. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority\" target=\"_blank\">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> (UKAEA), Miami-based <a href=\"https://citylabs.net/\" target=\"_blank\">City Labs</a>, Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co., and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nwnu.edu.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">Northwest Normal University</a> have all announced advances and funding in semiconductor-based nuclear batteries over the last two years, some with plans to commercialize. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.infinitypower.energy/\" target=\"_blank\">Infinity Power</a>, in San Diego, announced a novel electrochemical approach to converting radioisotope energy.</p><p>What markets these batteries will find\u2014if they can be commercialized\u2014will depend largely on cost, safety, and licensing issues. One of the most compelling applications is in uncrewed spacecraft for long-distance missions, which require decades of reliable power. Solar power works for missions close to the sun, but by the time a spacecraft gets to Jupiter, the available solar irradiance drops below 4 percent of that on Earth.</p><p>That leaves nuclear fission and radioisotope power as the only viable options for deep-space missions. Fission is ideal for larger power needs in space, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-nuclear-reactor-nasa-moon?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=hero&amp;utm_campaign=2025-08-22&amp;utm_content=hero1\" target=\"_blank\">like NASA\u2019s proposed 100-kilowatt lunar nuclear reactor</a>. But for lower, onboard power needs, nuclear batteries offer simpler designs and lower mass. The current radioisotope workhorse in space is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, which produces a few hundred watts.</p><h2>Radioisotopes: Not Just for Nuclear-Powered Pacemakers </h2><p>NASA\u2019s two Voyager missions, launched in 1977, each carry three RTGs that weigh about 38 kilograms, including 4.5 kg of plutonium-238. They\u2019re cylindrical and about the size of an office wastebasket. They initially produced 157 watts of electric power, but that drops over time as the plutonium-238 decays. A 157-W Voyager-based RTG that launched in 1977 will produce about 88 W today.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Two cylindrical metal machines stacked on top of each other in a cinder block room\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"607f2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p>Another good use for nuclear batteries is to supply power in remote locations on Earth. Beginning in the 1970s, for example, the Soviet Union deployed over 1,000 RTGs in northwestern Russia to power its uncrewed lighthouses, radio beacons, and weather stations. Most of these batteries ran on strontium-90, and each weighed about 2,000 kg. The United States has deployed hundreds of similar systems for remote power both on land and on the ocean floor, particularly for <a href=\"http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/ota-bp-eti-129.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remote monitoring sites in the Arctic</a>.</p><p>While nuclear batteries have proved successful for space exploration, remote power, and pacemakers, no new uses for these long-lived batteries have emerged. Many devices would benefit from long-lived batteries\u2014imagine a wireless tire pressure sensor that lasts the life of a car, for example. But the risks and costs of opting for a radioactive battery would have to be balanced against the benefits.</p><p>Another factor working against the widespread use of nuclear batteries is the need to track the fuel. In just about any country, the sellers and buyers of any such batteries intended for the general public would need to be licensed (see box, \u201cBoy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale\u201d). The buyer also typically takes on the burden of tracking and disposing of the material. Keeping tabs on radioactive material is a necessity, but this adds complexity to applications involving the general public.</p><h3>Boy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale</h3><br /><p>In just about any country, buyers of radioisotope fuel sources must be licensed\u2014with some exceptions. In the United States, for example, you don\u2019t need a license for some radioisotopes if the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part030/part030-0071.html\" target=\"_blank\">quantity is below a certain level</a> set by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Many smoke detectors contain about 1 microcurie, or 37,000 becquerels, of americium-241, which is below the exception limit of 5 \u00b5Ci (185,000 Bq). (The radioisotope ionizes the air within the detector, and the alarm is triggered when the presence of smoke alters the ionization rate.)</p><p>The exemption quantities are too small for even the smallest nuclear battery\u2014unless someone starts up a collection. That\u2019s just what <a href=\"https://inis.iaea.org/records/vpjmt-6nz83\" target=\"_blank\">a young man in Michigan</a> in the 1990s did. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he attempted to build a neutron generator by collecting americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping-lantern mantles, radium from old clocks, and tritium from gunsights. He amassed so much radioactive material that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared his home a Superfund hazardous waste clean-up site.</p><p>But the benefits of radioisotopes are profound, and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to use them with proper care. They\u2019re used worldwide on a daily basis primarily for medical imaging and cancer therapy. They\u2019re also used as tracers to monitor fluid flow and detect leaks, for nondestructive inspection of welds, and for explosive detection.\u2014J.B.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>One new use where the benefits may outweigh the risks and costs is providing longer-lived power to soldiers\u2014something the U.S. military has explored. Soldiers\u2019 missions often take them to remote or unstable locations where electricity may be unavailable, preventing them from charging their equipment. This forces soldiers to carry batteries, the weight and life of which limit their missions. Small nuclear batteries would provide a lightweight alternative\u2014potentially 1/100 the weight\u2014due to their higher energy density relative to that of chemical batteries. But they would need to be encased to shield soldiers from the radiation, and designed to withstand harsh conditions, which would add weight.</p><p>Another potential new use for nuclear batteries is to power autonomous sensors or robots that communicate, move, or fly. One compelling use would be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-robot-2671447539\" target=\"_self\">insect-size flying microdrones</a> for civilian and military purposes. But collecting them at the end of their flights might be difficult and would also leave tiny bits of radioactive material littering the landscape.</p><h2>Engineering Challenges: Betavoltaics Versus Alphavoltaics</h2><p>Let\u2019s turn to the engineering challenges of commercializing a miniature nuclear battery. In general, taking a promising battery technology from the lab to mass production is a complex process that\u2019s more likely to end in failure than success. With nuclear batteries, it involves negotiating a lot of trade-offs between cost, power, safety, and life-span.</p><p>First, you have to pick the fuel\u2014that is, an isotope of an element that will release radiation as it decays. Such isotopes emit three types of radiation: gamma rays, beta particles, and alpha particles. Gamma rays are short-wavelength electromagnetic waves that can travel deep into most solids, including living tissue. They\u2019re difficult to contain and capture, so gamma-emitting isotopes are typically avoided.</p><h3>Table 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u00a0</h3><br /><table border=\"0\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Isotope</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Type</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Maximum decay energy<br />(kiloelectron volt)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\"> Half-life (year)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Specific power (watts per gram)</th></tr><tr><td> Tritium</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">19</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">12.3</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.33</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Carbon-14</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">156</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,730</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.0013</td></tr><tr><td>Nickel-63</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">67</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">100</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.0058</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Promethium-147</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">225</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">2.6</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.41</td></tr><tr><td>Polonium-210</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">5,305</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.38</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">141</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Plutonium-238</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,593</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">87.7</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.56</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"photo-credit\">Credit/source: Jake Blanchard</p><p class=\"caption\">Radioisotopes emit particles with a spectrum of energies. The decay energy is a measure of the kinetic energy of emitted particles as the radioisotope decays. The specific power provided here is a measure of how much power an ideal, pure radioisotope source can generate per unit of mass at the beginning of its life.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Pure beta or alpha emitters are a better choice for nuclear batteries. Beta particles are electrons that have an intermediate penetration range in solids. Their decay energies go from a few kiloelectron volts (for tritium, or hydrogen-3) to a few megaelectron volts (for yttrium-90). Alpha particles, by contrast, are emitted at a higher energy than beta particles\u2014typically around 5 MeV\u2014and can\u2019t penetrate a piece of paper. But they can damage semiconductors by creating defects as they collide with the nuclei in the device. This makes alpha emitters best suited for non-semiconductor battery technologies that convert the heat generated by the source fuel into electricity.</p><p>Radioisotopes of nickel, carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, promethium, polonium, and plutonium all emit beta or alpha particles and are good options for nuclear batteries (see \u201cTable 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u201d). Which one to choose depends on several factors, including the isotope\u2019s half-life and its decay energy.</p><p>For the longest battery life, you\u2019ll want a radioisotope with a long half-life, because the battery\u2019s output power will drop by a factor of two over each half-life. That means a tritium-fueled device will lose half its power every 12 years, while a plutonium-238 battery will lose half its power every 88 years.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>What very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If your goal is instead to maximize the battery\u2019s power density\u2014such as for an insect-size microdrone\u2014then you\u2019ll need one with a short half-life<strong>.</strong> For example, polonium-210 has a half-life of a few months, but a power density of 141 watts per gram, which could give it enough power to carry its payload. The short half-life would mean it would work only for a few months and would completely decay within a couple of years. But for a microdrone that will probably be abandoned somewhere, perhaps that\u2019s a good thing. (Note that these power densities account for thermal power, but there are losses in converting to electricity, so the output power density of any devices created using this fuel will be lower.)</p><p>The safest nuclear battery fuels are tritium and nickel-63, because they produce low-energy beta particles that are easier to shield and less damaging to semiconductors than alpha particles. Pure tritium can be challenging to work with because it\u2019s a gas at room temperature. It can be converted into a metal hydride, but this process, which involves mixing it with stable isotopes, decreases its energy density. Another design consideration is that the lower penetration depth of these safer, low-energy <a href=\"https://blanchard.engr.wisc.edu/purebeta.htm\" target=\"_blank\">beta emitters</a> requires that the sources be made very thin, or else the particles will never reach the battery\u2019s semiconductor.</p><p>What about supply and cost? All radioisotopes are expensive to procure and are typically only available in small quantities. Just about any of them can be made during nuclear fission by placing a dedicated target material in the reactor core. They can also be made using particle accelerators. Some types of radioisotopes can be obtained from spent nuclear fuel. But none of these options is simple or inexpensive, because every step requires the handling of radioactive materials.</p><p>One gram of tritium costs about US $30,000 and will produce a thermal power of about 0.3 W, which would in turn typically produce an electric power of only a few milliwatts. The supply of plutonium-238 is so limited that NASA must set its launch schedule according to the availability of the fuel. As a result, NASA is pursuing americium-241 as an alternative. It\u2019s unclear how these costs would change if the market for these materials grows substantially.</p><h2>How to Convert Radioisotope Power Sources</h2><p>After choosing a fuel, you have to select a conversion technology. Early radioisotope power sources developed in the 1950s simply collected the charged decay particles, producing an electric potential difference between the collector and the source\u2014that is, a voltage\u2014that could then be tapped to produce electricity. The current in these designs was inherently low, and so the battery had to be run at a high voltage (in the kilovolts) to achieve a reasonable conversion efficiency, which proved too challenging.</p><p>To get around this problem, you can use a semiconductor to turn each charged particle emitted by the source into thousands of charge carriers, allowing the device to run at a few volts instead of a few kilovolts. The physics of such a device is essentially that of a solar cell, except that the source of the radiation is from a radioisotope instead of the sun. When the radioisotope is a beta-particle emitter, we call the device \u201cbetavoltaic.\u201d</p><h3>Three Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u00a0</h3><br /><p><span>As radioactive isotopes decay, their nuclei spontaneously release energy in the form of radiation</span>. The energy can be captured, converted into electricity, and stored, creating a nuclear battery. In common designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation and convert it to an electric current, or thermoelectric devices convert the heat that radioisotopes produce to electricity. But more-exotic techniques such as radioluminescent, thermionic, and thermophotovoltaic conversion are also being explored.  </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of light and energy transfer from radioactive to photovoltaic systems.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09f7f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-light-and-energy-transfer-from-radioactive-to-photovoltaic-systems.png?id=61488113&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Radioluminescent conversion</strong></p><p>In this approach, a scintillator, such as a cerium-doped lutetium aluminum crystal, is exposed to ionizing radiation from the isotope, causing it to emit light. The light is captured and converted to electricity with a photovoltaic cell, which can be tuned to the frequency of the emitted light to improve conversion efficiency. But the light production itself is inefficient.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of a heat engine showing heat flow and electron movement in a plasma-filled gap.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7136b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-a-heat-engine-showing-heat-flow-and-electron-movement-in-a-plasma-filled-gap.png?id=61488106&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermionic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This concept uses the radioisotope to produce a hot surface (typically above 1,500</span> \u00b0C), which then releases electrons via thermionic emission. The source is heated as the emitted particles deposit their kinetic energy in the solid through interactions with the source atoms. The electrons emitted by the surface can be collected to produce a potential and a current source. Conversion efficiency can reach 20 percent, but achieving the necessary temperatures requires large sources, so this technology is only appropriate for high-power applications. </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Heat-to-electricity conversion diagram using thermophotovoltaic (TPV) technology.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"49131\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/heat-to-electricity-conversion-diagram-using-thermophotovoltaic-tpv-technology.png?id=61488098&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermophotovoltaic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This strategy uses </span>a radioisotope to produce a hot surface, and electromagnetic radiation from the hot surface produces electricity within a photovoltaic cell. To obtain good efficiencies, these devices must run very hot\u2014around 2,000\u00b0C for a conversion efficiency of 29 percent.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Under development since the 1950s, betavoltaic batteries feature a radioactive emitter and a silicon-diode absorber. As the emitter naturally decays, electrons (in the form of beta particles) strike the absorber. This creates a cascade of electron-hole pairs, which occur when electrons are removed from their original position, leaving a \u201chole\u201d that generates a small but stable supply of electric current. This process is similar to that of a solar cell, where light produces the electron-hole pairs.</p><p>Betavoltaic batteries with silicon diodes have conversion efficiencies of a few percent, and up to 10 percent with silicon carbide, and can typically operate at around 1 volt. Some models indicate that this <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9936597\" target=\"_blank\">efficiency can be as high as 23.5 percent</a>. Recent research on betavoltaics uses diamond semiconductors, which offer even higher conversion efficiencies due to their higher bandgap.</p><p>Betavoltaics are solid-state, simple, and relatively inexpensive, so they offer an ideal way to produce a low-power option (less than about a milliwatt) for nuclear batteries. They can be used to create higher-power devices, but in those cases it\u2019s often better to switch to an alpha emitter to achieve a higher power density. However, because the alpha particles will damage a semiconductor, their use generally requires a conversion option that relies on heat converted to electricity.</p><p>For example, NASA uses thermoelectric conversion in its RTGs, which have been used to power not only <em>Voyager 1</em> and <em>2</em>, but also two Mars rovers and over <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rps-fleet.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">40 other NASA missions</a>. If you\u2019ve seen the movie <em>The Martian</em>, you may recall how Matt Damon\u2019s character, trapped alone on Mars, used an RTG: He needed a heat source to stay warm while traveling in a rover, so he dug up an old RTG from a previous mission and placed it inside his vehicle.</p><p>To convert the heat to electricity, the RTGs employ a series of thermocouples, which consist of a junction of two dissimilar conductors. These components produce a potential in the presence of a temperature gradient (via what\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/how-does-a-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-rtg-work-the-seebeck-effect/#:~:text=The%20scientist%2C%20Thomas%20Seebeck%2C%20found,of%20compounds%20known%20as%20semiconductors.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seebeck</a> effect). The pacemakers of the 1970s also relied on thermoelectric conversion, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p>Other, more-exotic conversion techniques include radioluminescent conversion, thermionic conversion, and thermophotovoltaic conversion (see sidebar, \u201cThree Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u201d), all of which work well in the lab but require higher operating temperatures or have degradation issues. Most companies are focused on developing betavoltaic technology because it permits the use of the safer beta emitters.</p><h2>Who Is Developing Nuclear Batteries?</h2><p>Since the invention of small betavoltaic power sources in the 1970s, the vast majority of research on nuclear batteries has focused on power levels of less than 1 microwatt (see \u201cTable 2: Who\u2019s Developing Nuclear Batteries\u201d). To date, many of these efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.betavolt.tech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</a> says it has a 100-\u00b5W battery that\u2019s about the size of a cereal square (15 by 15 by 5 millimeters) and can last 50 years.

Potential applications include aerospace, medical implants, wearable devices, MEMS systems, advanced sensors, small drones, miniature robots, law-enforcement equipment, and fire-safety remote communication.</p><p>Assuming Beijing Betavolt\u2019s device has a conversion efficiency of about 5 percent, the battery would have to hold about 20 curies, or 740 billion becquerels (0.4 grams), of nickel-63. This is well above the typical amount of nickel-63 available on the market, which is normally in the millicurie range.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">To date, many efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p>Infinity Power also uses nickel-63 in its coin-size battery, but may need less of it because of the novel electrochemical conversion process it has developed.

The decay of the radioisotope produces high-energy beta particles that ionize the electrolyte, creating a potential difference between the anode and cathode immersed in the solution and driving electron flow through an external circuit to produce electricity.</p><p>Academic and government researchers are also pursuing nuclear batteries. The University of Bristol, in England, and the UKAEA last year announced they had developed a battery fueled by carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. With carbon-14\u2019s half-life of 5,700 years, the battery could theoretically last for millennia. The U.K. has an ample supply of the fuel because it can be scavenged from the country\u2019s graphite-moderated, gas-cooled fission reactors. Carbon-14 produces beta particles with a maximum energy of 156 kiloelectron volt, which should be low enough to prevent damage to the battery\u2019s diamond semiconductor.</p><p>Meanwhile, a collaboration of researchers in China published a report in the December 2024 <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science</em></em> on a <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709846/authors#authors\" target=\"_blank\">radioluminescent nuclear battery</a>. The team used an X-ray source, which emits electromagnetic radiation, to mimic a beta source, which emits electrons, to help them understand how the device might perform. The X-ray photons excited two inorganic scintillators, causing them to emit light, and a commercial silicon photodiode converted the light to electricity.</p><p>The products envisioned by these startups offer great promise. The key to their lasting success will be identifying markets in which the benefits of nuclear batteries outweigh the challenges. The market for these devices in space applications is strong, but whether new markets will arise remains to be seen. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Yu-Tzu Chiu, who contributed reporting for this article.</em></p>"

By leveraging algebraic properties and periodicities, the FFT reduced the number of the operations, making it particularly and practically feasible for everyday tasks, replacing the less efficient analog methods.\u201d</p><h2>A new mathematical tool</h2><p>In 1963 Tukey, a professor of mathematics and statistics at Princeton, participated in a meeting of U.S. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Science_Advisory_Committee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Advisory Committee</a> to discuss ways to detect underground nuclear tests, according to the ETHW entry.</p><p>Also attending that meeting was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/richard-garwin\" target=\"_self\">Richard Garwin</a>, a physicist and engineer at <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/richard-garwin-obituary\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a> who played a key role in designing the first hydrogen bomb. He died in May. Read about his fascinating life in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/richard-garwin-hydrogen-bomb-obituary\" target=\"_self\">In Memoriam</a>. </p><p>Tukey told Garwin he was working on speeding up the computation of an existing method\u2014the Fourier transform\u2014thinking it might help with the detection. His algorithm<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> mathematically converted a signal from its original domain, such as time or space, to a frequency domain</a>.</p><p>Garwin recognized its potential and asked IBM to select a mathematical analyst to collaborate with Tukey. That person was Cooley, a research staff member working on numerical analysis and computation projects.</p><p>If the Fourier transform could be made faster, Garwin said, <a href=\"https://ethw.org/James_W._Cooley#:~:text=He%20suggested%20the%20idea%20of,and%20an%20IEEE%20Centennial%20medal.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">seismometers could be planted in the ground</a> in countries surrounding the Soviet Union to detect nuclear explosions from atomic bomb tests, because the Soviets wouldn\u2019t allow on-site tests, according to Cooley\u2019s <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Oral-History:James_W._Cooley#Tukey,_Garwin_and_FFT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">oral history</a> in the Engineering and Technology History Wiki. A seismometer measures ground vibrations, which are converted into electrical signals and recorded as seismograms.</p><p>To design sensors for underground nuclear tests, however, \u201cyou would have to process all the seismic signals, and a large part of the processing could be done by Fourier transforms,\u201d Cooley said in his oral history. But \u201cthe computing power at the time was not enough to process all of the signals you\u2019d need to do this.\u201d</p><p>The FFT could calculate a seismic sensor\u2019s frequency and produce images, IEEE Life Fellow <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/harold-stone\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Harold S. Stone</a> said at the Milestone event. He is an image processing researcher and Fellow emeritus at the <a href=\"https://www.nec-labs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NEC Laboratories America</a>, in Princeton, and a former IBM researcher.</p><p>Tukey and Cooley led the team that wrote the computer code that demonstrated the FFT\u2019s power.</p><p>\u201cThe demonstration of the Coley-Tukey algorithm showed that it was 100 times faster,\u201d Stone said. \u201cIt was so fast that it could keep up with the seismic data.\u201d</p><p>Sensors using the algorithm were planted, and they detected nuclear explosions within a 15-kilometer radius from where they were detonated, according to the ETHW entry.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cBy leveraging algebraic properties and periodicities, the FFT reduced the number of the operations, making it particularly and practically feasible for everyday tasks, replacing the less efficient analog methods.\u201d <strong>\u20142024 IEEE President Tom Coughlin</strong></span></p><p><span></span>In 1965 Cooley and Tukey published \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1965-19-090/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">An Algorithm for the Machine Calculation of Complex Fourier Series</a>,\u201d describing the FFT process.

Through his involvement with the IEEE Digital Signal Processing Committee (today known as the <a href=\"https://signalprocessingsociety.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Signal Processing Society</a>), he helped establish terminology and suggested research directions.</p><p>Although not one of the inventors, Garwin is credited with recognizing that the algorithm had wider applications, especially in scientific and engineering fields.</p><p>\u201cIn today\u2019s lingo, Garwin helped the FFT \u2018go viral\u2019 by getting Cooley and Tukey together,\u201d Stone said.</p><p>\u201cGarwin and Tukey sought better information to forestall and prevent wars,\u201d added Frank Anscombe, Tukey\u2019s nephew. \u201cThe Cooley-Tukey FFT swiftly advanced this cause by giving a practical, simplifying solution for wavy data. Thanks to the FFT, a technological rubicon began to be crossed: analog-to-digital machines.\u201d</p><h2>A spirit of collaboration between academia and industry</h2><p>Like so many innovations, the FFT came out of a collaboration between industry and academia, and it should be recognized for that, IEEE Fellow <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/princeton-dean-andrea-goldsmith\" target=\"_self\">Andrea Goldsmith</a> said at the ceremony. She explained that she regularly works with FFT in her research projects. At the time of the event, she was Princeton\u2019s dean of engineering and applied sciences. This month she started her new position as president of <a href=\"https://news.stonybrook.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stony Brook University</a>, in New York.</p><p>\u201cTaking the ideas we have from basic research in our university labs, talking to people in industry, and understanding how the research problems we work on can benefit industry either tomorrow or in five years or 20 years from now, is incredibly important,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people think of engineering as boring and dry and something that only nerds do, but there is such beauty and creativity in a lot of the innovations that we have developed, and I think the FFT is a perfect example of that.\u201d</p><p>The FFT joins more than 270 other IEEE Milestones. They are more than a marker of achievement, said IEEE Life Senior Member <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-bod-july-2026\" target=\"_self\">Bala S. Prasanna</a>, director of <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities/regional-list-region-1.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Region 1</a>.</p><p>\u201cThey are a testament to human ingenuity, perseverance, and the spirit of collaboration,\u201d Prasanna said. \u201cThese Milestones were more than just breakthroughs; they became catalysts for innovation, enabling progress in ways once thought impossible. Each one ensures that the story behind these innovations is preserved, not just as history but as inspiration for future generations.\u201d</p><p>Another <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/fft\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ceremony</a> was held on 11 June at the IBM Watson Research Center. </p><p>Milestone plaques recognizing the FFT are on display in the lobby of Princeton\u2019s <a href=\"https://engineering.princeton.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> and in the main lobby at the entrance of the IBM research center.</p><p>They read:</p><p><em>\u201cIn 1964 a computer program implementing a highly efficient Fourier analysis algorithm was demonstrated at IBM Research.

Even more concerning are the over 1.2 million pieces of space debris larger than one centimeter hurtling through space at incredible speeds. At those velocities, even a paint chip can damage a spacecraft, while larger debris can <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-jamming\" target=\"_blank\">destroy entire satellites</a>.</p><p>This growing congestion has turned collision avoidance into a daily headache for satellite operators worldwide. Currently, teams of specialists must manually assess threats, calculate risks, and coordinate with other operators when collisions seem likely.

It aims to revolutionize this chaotic process by automating most collision-avoidance activities. The system can evaluate potential crashes, generate precise maneuver plans, and support decision-making with minimal human intervention. Think of it as an air traffic control system for space, but with artificial intelligence handling much of the complex coordination.</p><h2>An AI Negotiator</h2><p>One of CREAM\u2019s most innovative features is its ability to connect different types of organizations involved in space operations. Satellite operators, space-monitoring services, regulators, and observers can all communicate through the system, streamlining what was previously a fragmented and often frustrating process.</p><p>The system goes even further by facilitating negotiations between operators when potential collisions involve two active satellites rather than debris. If operators disagree on the best solution, CREAM can refer the dispute to mediation services, ensuring fair and transparent resolution.</p><p>Currently, CREAM exists as a ground-based prototype system developed by <a href=\"https://www.gmv.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">GMV</a>, a Spanish private capital interest group, and <a href=\"https://guardtime.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Guardtime</a>, an Estonian data-management company. This version can already provide collision alerts and generate actionable avoidance maneuvers that ground crews can implement. However, the real breakthrough will come when CREAM moves into orbit itself.</p><p>The project is preparing for expanded pilot testing while simultaneously developing space-based versions. These include \u201cpiggyback missions\u201d where CREAM will ride aboard other spacecraft as a digital payload, plus a dedicated demonstration mission to test the system\u2019s capabilities in the harsh environment of space.</p><p>Beyond preventing immediate collisions, CREAM addresses a fundamental challenge in space governance. Establishing \u201crules of the road\u201d for space traffic has always faced a chicken and egg problem; you need both international agreement on the rules and the technology to enforce them.</p><p>CREAM provides that missing technological foundation. The system offers standardized tools that help operators follow best practices while giving regulators ways to monitor compliance. Its flexible design allows nontechnical users to update standards and rules as international norms evolve. This adaptability ensures CREAM will remain relevant as space technology advances and new challenges emerge. Rather than becoming obsolete, the system can grow and adapt alongside our expanding presence in space.</p>"

Today\u2019s young adults want everything instantly\u2014which isn\u2019t realistic in the workplace. </li><li>Keep learning. Today\u2019s technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are evolving quickly, and you need to stay on top of the latest innovations. </li><li>Don\u2019t wait for the perfect opportunity; rather, create it. </li><li>Don\u2019t view yourself as \u201cjust\u201d a software engineer or \u201cjust\u201d an associate engineer. Go the extra mile, even if you aren\u2019t paid to do so. That way, you\u2019ll always be one step ahead of the competition. </li><li>Build solutions that will have a real-world impact, not just theoretical value. Theoretical value is good to study, but make the application practical. When you do practical work, you\u2019ll come to know the difficulties, the failures, and the pros and cons.</li><li>Staying true to yourself will help you grow in your career.</li><li>Stay humble, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they are silly.</li><li>Get involved in a professional organization, such as IEEE, early in your career. You\u2019ll get to know about cutting-edge technologies, meet great leaders, and pick up skills that will help your career.</li></ul><p><span>\u201cIEEE stays updated on the frontier of technologies and gives back to the engineering community,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt also provides services to students and initiates talks where we can explore topics with respect to our skills and knowledge, and mentor others.\u201d</span></p><p>Interested in volunteering and mentoring, he decided to nominate himself for the position of IEEE Richmond Section chair. The section has more than 800 members and covers six cities and 26 counties.</p><p>Being chair is his first volunteer leadership position. He says he believed that running the section would enhance his leadership skills. Winning the election \u201cwas a miracle,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was another enrichment opportunity for my career.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/about/excom-2/\" target=\"_blank\">He began his term in January</a> and was initially anxious about the additional workload, he says, but so far his term has been an \u201camazing experience.\u201d He credits IEEE Senior Member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenjjones/\" target=\"_blank\">Allen Jones</a>, a past chair of the section, for helping him through the transition.</p><p>Pandy has been busy since taking office. The section formed a <a href=\"https://life.ieee.org/volunteers/life-members-affinity-groups/\" target=\"_blank\">life members affinity group</a> and has held events with the <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/vcu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Virginia Commonwealth University student branch</a> in Richmond. The section also held <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/leadership-skills-ieee-courses\" target=\"_blank\">career-development</a> events there, allowing IEEE members to mentor engineering students, provide them with networking tips, and help them refine their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://ieeemagnetics.org/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Magnetics Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society</a> chapters partnered with VCU, <a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI Ready RVA</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ritsva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Richmond Institute of Technology and Science</a> to increase<a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> artificial intelligence literacy for preuniversity students in underserved communities</a>. The initiative provides training to educators and offers workshops to students demonstrating the technology and its practical applications.</p><p>Through leading all those activities, Pandy says, he has picked up important skills including strategic planning, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5-tips-technical-presentations\" target=\"_blank\">public speaking</a>, team collaboration, and budget planning, which he can apply at work.</p><p>\u201cThese experiences have helped me drive large-scale IT transformation projects in my professional role,\u201d he says, \u201cand improved my ability to lead diverse and cross-functional teams.</p><p>\u201cVolunteering fuels my energy rather than drains it. Also, it\u2019s kind of a small, rewarding part of my weekly routine. I feel that I\u2019ve done a little bit to help someone somewhere move a step ahead in their career\u2014which gives me great satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Pandy hasn\u2019t lost his desire to be an entertainer. He performs whenever possible at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeZ2sFI74Do\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cultural events</a> and the section\u2019s social gatherings.</p><p>\u201cDancing and acting are now hobbies,\u201d he says.</p>"

The standard was a result of a <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 memorandum</a> from the Biden administration that requires federal agencies to transition to PQC-based security by 2035.</p><p>Cryptography relies on math problems that are nearly impossible to solve, but easy to check if a solution is correct. Armed with such math problems, only the holder of a secret key can check their solution and get access to the secret data. Today, most online cryptography relies on one of two such algorithms: either <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rsa-token-replacement-a-slow-process\" target=\"_blank\">RSA</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography\" target=\"_blank\">elliptic-curve cryptography</a>.</p><p>The cause for concern is that quantum computers, if a large enough one is ever built, would make easy work of the \u201chard\u201d problems underlying current cryptographic methods. Luckily, there are other math problems that appear to be equally hard for quantum computers and their existing classical counterparts. That\u2019s the basis of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2667758178\" target=\"_blank\">post-quantum cryptography</a>: cryptography that\u2019s secure against hypothetical quantum computers.</p><p>With the mathematics behind PQC ironed out, and standards in hand, the work of adoption is now underway. This is no easy feat: every computer, laptop, smartphone, self-driving car, or IoT device will have to fundamentally change the way they run cryptography.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ali.elkaafarani\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ali El Kaafarani</a> is a research fellow at the Oxford Mathematical Institute who contributed to the development of NIST\u2019s PQC standards. He also founded a company, <a href=\"https://pqshield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PQShield</a>, to help bring post-quantum cryptography into the real world by assisting original equipment manufacturers in implementing the new protocols. He spoke with <em>IEEE Spectrum <strong></strong><strong></strong></em><span>about</span> how adoption is going and whether the new standards will be implemented in time to beat the looming threat of quantum computers.</p><p><strong>What has changed in the industry since the NIST PQC standards came out?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait photograph of Ali El Kaafarani, dark haired man with a beard, a mustache and glasses\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"65f9b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-photograph-of-ali-el-kaafarani-dark-haired-man-with-a-beard-a-mustache-and-glasses.jpg?id=61455658&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ali El Kaafarani</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">PQShield</small></p><p><strong>Ali El Kaafarani</strong><strong>:</strong> Before the standards came out, a lot of people were not talking about it at all, in the spirit of \u201cIf it\u2019s working, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d Once the standards were published, the whole story changed, because now it\u2019s not hypothetical quantum hype, it\u2019s a compliance issue. There are standards published by the U.S. government. There are deadlines for the adoption. And the 2035 [deadline] came together with the publication from [the National Security Agency] and was adopted in formal legislation that passed Congress, and therefore there is no way around it. Now it\u2019s a compliance issue.</p><p>Before, people used to ask us, \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer. But that\u2019s the issue, because we\u2019re talking about a risk that can materialize any time. Some other, more intelligent people who have access to a wider range of information decided in 2015 to categorize quantum computing as a real threat. So this year was a transformational year, because the question went from \u201cWhy do we need it?\u201d to \u201cHow are we going to use it?\u201d And the whole supply chain started looking into who\u2019s going to do what, from chip design to the network security layer, to the critical national infrastructure, to build up a post-quantum-enabled network security kit.</p><h2>Challenges in PQC Implementation</h2><p><strong>What are some of the difficulties of implementing the NIST standards?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> You have the beautiful math, you have the algorithms from NIST, but you also have the wild west of cybersecurity. That infrastructure goes from the smallest sensors and car keys, etc., to the largest server sitting there and trying to crunch hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, each with different security requirements, each with different energy consumption requirements. Now that is a different problem. That\u2019s not a mathematical problem, that\u2019s an implementation problem. This is where you need a company like PQShield, where we gather hardware engineers, and firmware engineers, and software engineers, and mathematicians, and everyone else around them to actually say, \u201cWhat can we do with this particular use case?\u201d</p><p>Cryptography is the backbone of cybersecurity infrastructure, and worse than that, it\u2019s the invisible piece that nobody cares about until it breaks. If it\u2019s working, nobody touches it. They only talk about it when there\u2019s a breach, and then they try to fix things. In the end, they usually put Band-Aids on it. That\u2019s normal, because enterprises can\u2019t sell the security feature to the customers. They were just using it when governments force them, like when there\u2019s a compliance issue. And now it\u2019s a much bigger problem, as someone is telling them, \u201cYou know what, all the cryptography that you\u2019ve been using for the past 15 years, 20 years, you need to change it, actually.\u201d</p><p><strong>Are there security concerns for the PQC algorithm implementations?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> Well, we haven\u2019t done it before. It hasn\u2019t been battle-tested. And now what we\u2019re saying is, \u201cHey, AMD and the rest of the hardware or semiconductor world, go and put all those new algorithms in hardware, and trust us, they\u2019re going to work fine, and then nobody\u2019s going to be able to hack them and extract the key.\u201d That\u2019s not easy, right? Nobody has the guts to say this.</p><p>That\u2019s why, at PQShield, we have vulnerability teams that are trying to break our own designs, separately from those teams who are designing things. You have to do this. You need to be one step ahead of attackers. That\u2019s all you need to do, and that\u2019s all you can do, because you can\u2019t say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got something that is secure. Nobody can break it.\u201d If you say that, you\u2019re going to eat a humble pie in 10 years\u2019 time, because maybe someone will come up with a way to break it. You need to just do this continuous innovation and continuous security testing for your products.</p><p>Because PQC is new, we still haven\u2019t seen all the creativity of attackers trying to bypass the beautiful mathematics and come up with those creative and nasty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\" target=\"_blank\">side-channel attacks</a> that just laugh at the mathematics. For example, some attacks look at the energy consumption the algorithm is taking on your laptop, and they extract the key from the differences in energy consumption. Or there are timing attacks that look at how long it takes for you to encrypt the same message 100 times and how that\u2019s changing, and they can actually extract the key. So there are different ways to attack algorithms there, and that\u2019s not new. We just don\u2019t have billions of these devices in our hands now that have post-quantum cryptography that people have tested.</p><h2>Progress in PQC Adoption</h2><p><strong>How would you say adoption has been going so far?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> The fact that a lot of companies only started when the standards were published, it puts us in a position where there are some that are well advanced in their thoughts and their processes and their adoption, and there are others that are totally new to it because they were not paying attention, and they were just kicking the can down the road. The majority of those who were kicking the can down the road are the ones that don\u2019t sit high up in the supply chain, because they felt like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s responsibility. But they didn\u2019t understand that they had to influence their suppliers when it comes to their requirements and timelines and integration and so many things that they have to prepare. This is what\u2019s going on now: A lot of them are doing a lot of work.</p><p>Now, those who sit high up in the supply chain, quite a few of them have made great progress and started embedding post-quantum cryptography designs into new products and are trying to work out a way to upgrade products that are already on the ground.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re in a great place, where everyone is doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. That\u2019s not the case. But I think that from last year, when many people were asking \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d and are now asking \u201cHow can I be compliant? Where do you think I should start? And how can I evaluate where the infrastructure to understand where the most valuable assets are, and how can I protect them? What influence can I exercise on my suppliers?\u201d I think huge progress has been made.</p><p>Is it enough? It\u2019s never enough in security. Security is damn difficult. It\u2019s a multidisciplinary topic. There are two types of people: those who love to build security products, and those who would love to break them. We\u2019re trying to get most of those who love to break them onto the right side of history so that they can make products stronger rather than actually making existing ones vulnerable for exploitation.</p><p><strong>Do you think we\u2019re going to make it by 2035?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> I think that the majority of our infrastructure should be post-quantum secure by 2035, and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s a good thought to have. Now, what happens if quantum computers happen to become reality before that? That\u2019s a good topic for a TV series or for a movie. What happens when most secrets are readable? People are not thinking hard enough about it. I don\u2019t think that anyone has an answer for that. <strong></strong></p>"

Growing up in India, he would take apart remote-controlled cars and use the motors and batteries to build something new.</p><p>No one in his family worked in science, technology, engineering, or math, he says, but science has always felt \u201ccompletely natural.\u201d</p><p>His fascination with STEM subjects deepened in high school, and his teachers fueled his passion. But it was M.R. Shenoy, a physics professor at the <a href=\"https://home.iitd.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a>, who inspired him to pursue research in the semiconductor field.</p><p>As an undergraduate at the <a href=\"https://www.mnnit.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology</a>, in Allahabad, India, Rudra took an online semiconductor optoelectronics certification course offered by NPTEL that was taught by Shenoy.</p><p>Motivated to gain experience in the field, from 2017 to 2019 Rudra completed several internships working on semiconductor fabrication at organizations including the <a href=\"https://iitbhu.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of technology (BHU)</a>, Varanasi; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Technology</a>, Kharagpur; and the <a href=\"https://www.ceeri.res.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute</a>.</p><p>\u201cThese internships were my first real exposure to experimental research and gave me a foundation in device physics and material science,\u201d he says.</p><p>He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communications engineering from MNNIT in 2019.</p><h2>Working in semiconductor fabrication and FinFET</h2><p>After graduating he became a research assistant at the <a href=\"https://iisc.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), in Bengaluru.</p><p>There he developed a thin film of manganese vanadium oxide using the epitaxy process. The method grows the manganese vanadium oxide on top of the crystal substrate\u2014which gives engineers more control over the film\u2019s thickness, composition, and crystal structure, according to <a href=\"https://www.photonics.com/EDU/epitaxial_deposition/d8286\" target=\"_blank\">Photonics Media</a>. Rudra used the film to develop a photodetector for infrared light.</p><p>After a year he joined semiconductor manufacturer <a href=\"https://gf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GlobalFoundries</a>, also in Bengaluru, as an integration and yield engineer. He continued his work at IISc on the weekends.</p><p>\u201cBefore joining, I had modest expectations\u2014largely because of the limited semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in India,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I realized that hardware-focused work was indeed happening in the industry. That experience planted the seed of transitioning from academia to cutting-edge industrial R&amp;D.\u201d</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cFor any young professional in STEM, IEEE isn\u2019t just a resource; it\u2019s a launchpad.\u201d</span></p><p><span></span>While at GlobalFoundries, he worked on BEOL interconnects to enhance the yield of the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-foundry-finfet\" target=\"_self\">FinFET</a> chips, which are used in automotive technology, smartphones, and smart speakers. In conventional planar transistors, the gate sits atop a flat silicon channel, controlling the flow of current between the source and drain from only one side. As transistors shrank in size, however, they became <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">less reliable and leaked current,</a> wasting power. FinFET development was led by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law\" target=\"_self\">Chenming Hu</a>, who received the 2020<a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for the invention. FinFET\u2019s 3D structure provides better control of the current.</p><p>In 2021 Rudra decided to continue his education and was accepted into the master\u2019s degree program in electrical and computer engineering at the <a href=\"https://odei.umich.edu/2023/10/19/university-of-michigan-celebrates-first-generation-college-students-during-week-long-events/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor.</p><p>\u201cI chose this school because there was a particular professor working on LED devices whose research really resonated with me,\u201d he says. The professor, <a href=\"https://mi.engin.umich.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Fellow Zetian Mi</a>, was working on III-V semiconductor optoelectronic devices. Rudra was part of Mi\u2019s research team for the first two semesters of his graduate program, working on the fabrication and characterization of III-Nitride-based microLEDs. Rudra also completed an internship at <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> in Redmond, Wash., where he developed integration processes for waveguide-based photonic devices for AR/VR systems.</p><p>\u201cThat experience helped me understand how photonics intersects with semiconductor manufacturing,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly in emerging applications like next-gen displays and wearable optics.\u201d</p><p>After earning his degree in 2023, he joined <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Semiconductor</a> in Austin, Texas, as a device integration engineer. There he returned to working on FinFETs, but this time analyzing and optimizing device and front-end-of-line integration for 14-nm node technology and how different processes affect the electrical performance and yield of FinFETs.</p><p>After a year, he left to join IBM Research.</p><p>\u201cBeing part of such a high-impact, globally collaborative initiative has been a fantastic experience and one that continues to push me technically and professionally,\u201d he says.</p><p>Since working at the company, he has filed 22 U.S. patents.</p><p>He received a slew of honors last year, including being named to<a href=\"https://www.semiconwest.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon West</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30 list, the<a href=\"https://www.sme.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Society of Manufacturing Engineers</a>\u2019s 30 Under 30, and<a href=\"https://www.semiconeuropa.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Semicon Europa</a>\u2019s 20 Under 30. Recently, he made the<a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/albany/\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Albany Business Review</em></em></a> 40 Under 40 list.</p><p>\u201cThese recognitions,\u201d he says, \u201chave been deeply motivating\u2014not just as personal milestones but as validation of the collective work I\u2019ve been part of, and the mentors who\u2019ve helped shape my path.\u201d</p><h2>Making important connections at IEEE</h2><p>Rudra joined IEEE in 2020 after his <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9117916\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cVisible Light Response in Defect Engineered Wrinkle Network Nanostructured ZnO\u201d</a> research paper was accepted by the <a href=\"https://edtm2025.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Electron Devices Technology and Manufacturing Conference</a>. He continues to renew his membership, he says, because of the networking opportunities it provides, as well as technical content that helps him stay up to date on semiconductors.</p><p>In addition to the IEEE Computer Society, he is an active member of the IEEE <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Electron Devices</a> (EDS), <a href=\"https://eps.ieee.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Electronics Packaging</a>, and<a href=\"https://ieeephotonics.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Photonics</a> societies. Each \u201cis home to a vibrant network of engineers, scientists, and innovators who are accomplished in their respective fields,\u201d Rudra says.</p><p>In 2022 he received an <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/education/student-fellowships/masters-student-fellowship\" target=\"_blank\">Electron Devices Society master\u2019s fellowship</a>, which awarded him $2,000 to use toward research within the society\u2019s fields of interest. Receiving the honor, he says, was a powerful motivator.</p><p>He is active with <a href=\"https://yp.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Young Professionals</a> and is a member of the Electron Devices Society\u2019s YP committee. Being a part of the community, he says, gives him access to world-class expertise and provides resources to help him make career decisions and solve technical challenges.</p><p>He is also a part of the organizing committee for this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://eds.ieee.org/education/summer-schools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE EDS Summer School</a>, a two-day lecture program for university seniors, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young professionals.</p><p>\u201cFor any young professional in STEM, I believe IEEE isn\u2019t just a resource; it\u2019s a launchpad,\u201d Rudra says. \u201cGetting involved early helps you grow technically, professionally, and personally in a way few organizations can offer.\u201d</p>"

A score of 100 percent\u2014an admittedly unreachable goal\u2014would mean that every transistor is computing a number that contributes to the final results of a program. Less than 100 percent means that the design devotes silicon and power to inefficient computing and to logic that doesn\u2019t do computing.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s this other logic doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Austin:</strong> If you look at how high-end architectures have been evolving, you can divide the design into two parts: the part that actually does the computation of the program and the part that decides what computation to do. The most successful designs are squeezing that \u201cdeciding what to do\u201d part down as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Where is computing efficiency lost in today\u2019s designs?</strong></p><p><strong>Austin: </strong>The two losses that we experience in computation are precision loss and speculation loss. Precision loss means you\u2019re using too many bits to do your computation. You see this trend in the GPU world. They\u2019ve gone from 32-bit floating-point precision to 16-bit to 8-bit to even smaller. These are all trying to minimize precision loss in the computation.</p><p>Speculation loss comes when instructions are hard to predict. [<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-spectre-and-meltdown-hacks-really-worked\" target=\"_self\">Speculative execution</a> is when the computer guesses what instruction will come next and starts working even before the instruction arrives.] Routinely, in a high-end CPU, you\u2019ll see two [speculative] instruction results thrown away for every one that is usable.</p><p><strong>You\u2019ve applied the metric to an Intel CPU, an Nvidia GPU, and </strong><a href=\"https://groq.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Groq</strong></a><strong>\u2019s AI inference chip. Find anything surprising?</strong></p><p><strong>Austin: </strong>Yeah! The gap between the CPU and the GPU was a lot less than I thought it would be. The GPU was more than three times better than the CPU. But that was only 4.64 percent [devoted to efficient computing] versus 1.35 percent. For the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-ai\" target=\"_self\">Groq</a> chip, it was 15.24 percent. There\u2019s so much of these chips that\u2019s not directly doing compute.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s wrong with computing today that you felt like you needed to come up with this metric?</strong></p><p><strong>Austin:</strong> I think we\u2019re actually in a very good state. But it\u2019s very apparent when you look at AI scaling trends that we need more compute, bigger access to memory, more memory bandwidth. And this comes around at the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stco-system-technology-cooptimization\" target=\"_self\">end of Moore\u2019s Law</a><strong>. </strong>As a computer architect, if you want to create a better computer, you need to take the same 20 billion transistors and rearrange them in a way that is more valuable than the previous arrangement. I think that means we\u2019re going to need leaner and leaner designs.</p><p><em>This article appears in the September 2025 print issue as \u201c<span>Todd Austin</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

In response, NASA\u2019s interim chief Sean Duffy announced in August that the United States would fast track its lunar nuclear power program to have one ready by 2030.</p><p>But this sudden frenzy raises a few questions\u2014such as why do we want nuclear reactors on the moon in the first place? And how would they work? <em></em><span>To find out, <em>IEEE Spectrum</em><span> spoke with</span></span> <a href=\"https://npre.illinois.edu/people/profile/kdhuff\" target=\"_blank\">Katy Huff</a>, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Advanced Reactor Fuel Cycles Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Huff previously served as the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Why do the world\u2019s biggest space organizations want nuclear reactors on the moon, and what would they power?</strong></p><p><strong>Katy Huff</strong>: There\u2019s a growing interest in having a more sustained presence of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/moon-landing-2025\" target=\"_blank\">humans on the moon for scientific discovery</a>. Resources like helium-3, which can serve as a fusion fuel, may be part of the appeal. NASA is planning to build this kind of lunar exploration base through its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/\" target=\"_blank\">Artemis</a> program, and China and Russia are working together to build one called the <a href=\"https://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465652/n6465653/c6812150/content.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Lunar Research Station</a>. Any such <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/moon-base\" target=\"_blank\">lunar base</a> would absolutely need nuclear power. Renewables alone are too intermittent to meet the energy needs of life on the moon. Plus, the cost of getting things into space scales by mass, so the unmatched energy density of uranium fission is our greatest opportunity.</p><p><strong>Why is it suddenly a race? What\u2019s the urgency?</strong></p><p><strong>Huff:</strong> The momentum began with the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/space-technology-mission-directorate/tdm/fission-surface-power/\" target=\"_blank\">fission surface power project</a> at NASA, which a few years ago solicited designs for 40-kilowatt lunar microreactors. Three designs were selected and awarded US $5 million each. Since then, China and Russia have announced on at least three occasions a joint effort to design their own lunar microreactor with a launch target in the mid-2030s. In response, NASA is accelerating its timeline for the U.S. reactor to 2030 and increasing the target power capacity to 100 kW. Sean Duffy has said publicly that if China and Russia are the first to stake a claim for a lunar power plant, they could <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nasa-fsp-directive-aug42.pdf?emrc=4b2928\" target=\"_blank\">declare a de facto keep-out zone</a>, limiting the United States\u2019 options to site its base. So the U.S. aims to get there before China and Russia to claim a region with access to water ice, which aids life support for astronauts.<strong></strong></p><h2>Designing Lunar Nuclear Reactors</h2><p><strong>What are the considerations for designing a nuclear reactor for the moon? </strong></p><p><strong>Huff</strong>: In very low gravity, fluids won\u2019t behave exactly as they do on Earth. So the circulation patterns for the reactor\u2019s fluid coolants will need to be recalculated. And the moon\u2019s large temperature swings, which vary hundreds of degrees from lunar day to night, will require the reactor to<strong> </strong>use systems that are more isolated from those swings.<strong> </strong>On Earth we eject waste heat easily because there are thermally stable heat sinks like water bodies available. </p><p><strong>What kind of reactor do you expect NASA to choose? </strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait of Katy Huff softly smiling.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4c034\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-katy-huff-softly-smiling.jpg?id=61501102&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\"><a href=\"https://npre.illinois.edu/people/profile/kdhuff\" target=\"_blank\">Katy Huff</a> previously served as the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Katy Huff</small></p><p><strong>Huff</strong>: It would make sense if NASA chose one of the three designs previously selected for the fission surface power program, rather than starting from scratch. But with the over-doubling of target capacity, from 40 kW to 100 kW, there will be a bit of a redesign involved, because you don\u2019t just turn up the knob. The three awards went to <a href=\"https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lockheed Martin</a>/<a href=\"https://www.bwxt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BWXT</a>, <a href=\"https://westinghouse.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopGsx52gyFSr9YtLTq_wG18TUHx_ytWA7NLFFK9rJb1x_pMObps\" target=\"_blank\">Westinghouse</a>/<a href=\"https://www.l3harris.com/company/powering-defense-and-space-exploration\" target=\"_blank\">Aerojet Rocketdyne</a>, and <a href=\"https://x-energy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">X-energy</a>/<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boeing</a>. Some of them are developing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/microreactor\" target=\"_blank\">microreactors </a>that are based around <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-powered-data-center\" target=\"_blank\">tristructural isotropic [TRISO] fuel</a>, which is a type of highly robust uranium fuel, so I would expect the lunar reactor to be designed using that. For the coolant, I don\u2019t expect them to choose water, because water\u2019s thermal properties limit the range of temperatures it can cool effectively, which constrains reactor efficiency. And I don\u2019t expect it to be liquid salt either, because it can be corrosive, and this lunar reactor needs to operate for 10 years with no intervention. So I suspect they\u2019ll choose a gas such as helium. And then for power conversion, NASA\u2019s directive explicitly said that a closed <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250000841/downloads/Mason%20NETS%20paper%202025c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Brayton cycle</a><strong> </strong>would be a requirement.</p><p><strong>What would transport and startup look like?</strong></p><p><strong>Huff</strong>: The reactor would be fully constructed on Earth and ready to go, with the fuel in place. My expectation is that it would be transported with the control elements fully inserted into the reactor to prevent a chain reaction from starting during transit. Once on the moon, a startup sequence would be initiated remotely or by the astronauts there. The control rods would then withdraw from the reactor, and a small neutron source like californium-252 would kick off the reaction.</p><p><strong>A deadline of 2030 feels pretty rushed considering the United States doesn\u2019t have a final design for the reactor, nor firm plans for a lunar base.</strong></p><p><strong>Huff</strong>: Right. That timeline does appear ambitious. We\u2019ll have a hard enough time getting a reactor of this scale deployed as a prototype terrestrially in the next four and a half years. Getting one launch-ready and onto the moon by then is a recipe for eventually having to explain why we didn\u2019t meet that timeline.<strong> </strong>And that could be a problem, reputationally, for nuclear energy more so than space exploration because people love NASA. Little kids and grown-ups alike wear NASA T-shirts. No one\u2019s wearing DOE T-shirts.</p><h2>Risks of Lunar Reactor Launch</h2><p><strong>What are the risks if something goes wrong with the launch?</strong></p><p><strong>Huff</strong>: Beautifully enough, fresh uranium fuel doesn\u2019t present a radiological hazard the way spent uranium would. Only after it becomes the fission products is it significantly radioactive. So as long as the reactor doesn\u2019t operate before launch, the hazard is quite low. Even if the fuel were dispersed over the Earth, it wouldn\u2019t pose a significant danger to the people around it. I literally have a sample of uranium sitting by my desk. On top of that, there\u2019s a robust launch safety protocol already established for any radiological object. NASA has a lot of experience with this from sending plutonium thermoelectric generators, which are more like a nuclear battery, for previous missions.</p><p><strong>Things have gone wrong with some of the fission reactors previously launched into space; what happened to those?</strong></p><p><strong>Huff</strong>: The biggest fission reactors anyone has launched into space were the 5 kW electric TOPAZ-I reactors that were part of the Soviet program. One of them had a serious incident and broke apart. It\u2019s now in high orbit in pieces, including some of its sodium coolant, which is just sort of floating around up there as liquid metal spheres. But that doesn\u2019t impact the Earth because it\u2019s a tiny amount of radiological source material at an incredible distance from Earth. The more unfortunate incident happened with the Soviet Kosmos 954 reactor, which, after operating in orbit, experienced uncontrolled reentry and disintegrated over a 600-kilometer swath of Canadian territory.</p><p><strong>What happens if an asteroid hits the moon or directly hits the lunar nuclear reactor?</strong></p><p><strong>Huff</strong>: A direct strike could damage the reactor and cause localized dispersion of the fuel. This might be a motivation to use TRISO fuel. It\u2019s so robust because the fuel and fission products are housed in thousands of spherical, chia seed\u2013size particles that are coated in silicon carbide. It can withstand incredible impacts and heat\u2014well beyond the temperature of lava. Testing has shown that even when subjected to <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1915/ML19155A173.pdf%20.\" target=\"_blank\">1,700\u00b0C heat for 300 hours</a>, TRISO retains its fission products with no failures. So in the unlikely event that there\u2019s a dead-on collision with a large asteroid at the reactor site, the debris of the reactor may be distributed in the dust of the moon, but all those little TRISO particles will hopefully remain intact.</p>"
