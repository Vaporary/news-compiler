        "summary": "This paper shows the key, yet overlooked, role played by the legacy of a high inflation history on the strength of the monetary policy response to inflationary shocks. To rationalize this, we propose a New Keynesian model that diverges from the existing workhorse model by adding path-dependence (to a forward-looking model) and potentially imperfect central bank credibility. We show that achieving low inflation (hitting the target) requires more aggressive monetary policy reactions, and is costlier from an output point of view, when individuals\u2019 past inflationary experiences shape their inflation expectation formation. In turn, we provide empirical evidence of the need for these two theoretical additions. Countries that experienced a high level of inflation before adopting the IT regime tend to respond more aggressively to deviations of inflation expectations from the central bank\u2019s target. We also point to the existence of a credibility puzzle, whereby the strength of a central bank\u2019s monetary policy response to deviations from the inflation target remains broadly unchanged even as central banks gain credibility over time. Put differently, a country\u2019s inflationary past casts a long and persistent shadow on central banks."

        "summary": "We use a novel dataset of production costs, wholesale prices, and retail prices from a large global manufacturer to study markups and pricing behavior along the supply chain. We document several facts about markups covering the period July 2018 through June 2023, and we propose a model of supply chain pricing behavior that rationalizes key pat-terns in our data. We find substantial dispersion in markups across products at each supply chain level. Manufacturer and retail markups are negatively correlated in the cross section and over time. Despite time-series variation in firm-level markups, total markups\u2014reflecting the relationship between retail prices and production costs\u2014are stable over time, even when prices increased along with inflation in the United States in 2022. We apply our model to quantify factors that determine relative bargaining power between the manufacturer and retailers, leveraging variation across countries, products, and time. Finally, we consider the dynamics of cost pass-through and the mediating role of manufacturer-retailer bargaining in price dynamics, with implications for current policy debates, including trade policy and tariffs."

        "summary": "Recent research finds that the shelter component of CPI inflation responds with a lag to movements in market rents\u2014the rents that tenants pay when they move into a new dwelling. This paper seeks to improve our understanding of this fact. We start by identifying three sources of lags between market rents and CPI shelter: the rents of most tenants are set in long-term leases; rents are smoothed for continuing tenants who renew leases; and CPI shelter inflation is measured with rent changes over six months. We incorporate these lags in a model of shelter inflation and compare the model to monthly data since 2015, using the Zillow Observed Rent Index to measure market rents. We find that the model performs fairly well, suggesting that it may be useful for understanding and forecasting inflation."

Not all are unique to HANK models. (i) Long run fiscal changes force monetary adjustments. (ii) Sustainable permanent deficits are feasible. (iii) Monetary policy leaves fiscal footprints, even with passive fiscal policy. (iv) Fewer controversies around active fiscal policy. (v) Equilibria are unique under a wider class of fiscal and monetary rules. (vi) With short-term debt, raising nominal rates without a fiscal contraction raises inflation. (vii) Unfunded fiscal stimulus is more inflationary. (viii) Even fully funded fiscal stimulus is inflationary. (ix) Fiscal transfers can substitute for monetary policy in the aggregate."

The directives, delivered via a set of four executive orders, set ambitious goals, such as having <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/reinvigorating-the-nuclear-industrial-base/\" target=\"_blank\">10 new large reactors</a> under construction by 2030, and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission/\" target=\"_blank\">overhauling the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (NRC).</p><p>One <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/deploying-advanced-nuclear-reactor-technologies-for-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\">particularly eager provision</a> instructs the U.S. Department of Energy to designate, within 90 days, at least one site on DOE-controlled land for the deployment of an advanced nuclear reactor\u2014a nearly impossible deadline that\u2019s coming up August 21.</p><p>The orders sparked a flurry of discussion across the nuclear industry and sent stakeholders scrambling. Experts weighed the promise of accelerated nuclear deployments against the potential of losing regulatory integrity. Whether the U.S. government, military, and industry stakeholders can meet the demands of the directives and timelines is unclear.</p><p>As someone with deep expertise in nuclear project development and licensing, I\u2019ve chosen to focus this article on the 90-day site-selection directive\u2014perhaps the first litmus test to see if the Trump administration will execute on its challenging deadlines.<strong> </strong></p><p>The process for selecting a site for a new nuclear plant in the United States is an arduous and complex process that blends engineering feasibility, environmental science, safety, emergency planning, economics, and public trust, all while complying with regulations and guidance. It\u2019s never been done in 90 days, at least not with regulatory approval.</p><p>But there might be one way for the DOE to meet that deadline: Rely on sites that are already deeply prepared with existing documentation and few unknowns. There are two locations in the United States that come close to fitting this category: <a href=\"https://inl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho National Laboratory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>.</p><h2>How to Pick a Site for an Advanced Nuclear Reactor</h2><p>To host a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States, a site must first receive a license from the NRC. To get that license, reactor owners typically take a couple of years to prepare the application, 6 to 12 months of which is needed to perform and document the site-selection process. The regulator then reviews the application and performs an environmental impact statement (EIS)\u2014a process that historically took more than two years, but is <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/29/2025-09798/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission\" target=\"_blank\">now required to be completed in 18 months, per new directives</a>.</p><p>The first step in selecting a site is to identify the region of interest. Next, unsuitable or problematic parts of that region, such as those that are prone to earthquakes, flooding, or landslides, are eliminated.</p><p>Remaining areas of land in the region are then assessed for technical and environmental suitability. For a small modular reactor (SMR), a type of advanced nuclear reactor, an ideal site size is a couple of hundred acres (about 80 hectares), while a thousand acres (over 400 ha) is ideal for a large nuclear plant. Reactors also need sufficient cooling water, which typically comes from a nearby ocean, lake, river, or aquafer.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactor-united-states\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Pushes $900 Million for Small Modular Reactor</a></p><p>Developers must assess the nearby population and infrastructure, search for endangered species, and assess wetlands. Business factors are also considered, such as distance to interconnection with transmission, cost to install and operate cooling, and the amount of site grading needed.</p><p>Finally, applicants assign weighting values to the criteria and rate sites against the various parameters. This iterative process, followed by further field investigations and narrowing of options, leads to the selection of one preferred site, with two to four others defined as alternatives. After that, the NRC reviews the application and proceeds with the environmental impact statement process.</p><h2>DOE\u2019s Looming Site-Selection Deadline</h2><p>It\u2019s unclear how far along the DOE is in its attempt to comply with the executive order\u2019s 90-day challenge to pick a site for a nuclear plant. Meeting the deadline will require creative thinking and decisive action.</p><p>With that in mind, the best path forward for the DOE is to focus on sites that have already undergone National Environmental Policy Act review and some NRC licensing. The DOE\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=Idaho+National+Lab\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho National Laboratory</a> (INL) in Idaho Falls, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=oak+ridge+national+Lab\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) in Tennessee, both meet those criteria.</p><p>Near INL, there are two options: the site where <a href=\"https://www.nuscalepower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NuScale Power</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uamps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems</a> were pursuing an NRC license for an SMR facility before <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-modular-reactors-nuscale\" target=\"_blank\">abandoning the project</a> in November 2023, and the site proposed for the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/fc/areva-eagle-rock-lc.html\" target=\"_blank\">Eagle Rock uranium enrichment facility</a> that received a license in 2011 but was not constructed.</p><p>INL has hosted <a href=\"https://inl.gov/history/52-reactors/#:~:text=Nuclear%20Heritage,square%2Dmile%20site%20since%201949.\" target=\"_blank\">52 reactors since 1949</a>, so it\u2019s likely a suitable place from an environmental and safety perspective. Although both the NuScale and Eagle Rock sites meet the intent of the executive order, neither received an environmental impact statement from the NRC for a new nuclear reactor. Further, the Eagle Rock site is adjacent to INL, not on its site.</p><p>Perhaps the ideal choice is the 935-acre (378-ha) parcel of land on a peninsula on the Clinch River in Tennessee, adjacent to ORNL. The site is federally owned, currently controlled by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is the only site in the United States that has received a green light\u2014an early site permit from the NRC\u2014for SMRs.</p><p>The Clinch River site was partially developed in the 1970s for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor project, a liquid-metal fast breeder reactor that was abandoned in the early 1980s. The NRC in 2019 licensed the site to TVA for the construction and operation of two or more SMRs. This <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1935/ML19352D868.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">permit</a> allows for up to 800 megawatts electric (MWe) of nuclear power and followed a thorough environmental and safety review that remains valid through 2039.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"An illustration imagines what the TVA BWRX-300 SMR as a large white building and electrical equipment surrounded by lush green forests and land, with a river and city in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5f2ff\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-imagines-what-the-tva-bwrx-300-smr-as-a-large-white-building-and-electrical-equipment-surrounded-by-lush-green-f.jpg?id=61421173&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A small modular reactor called the BWRX-300, developed by GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy, is planned for the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s Clinch River site.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">TVA </small></p><p>In May this year, <a href=\"https://www.tva.com/news-media/releases/tva-submits-nation-s-first-construction-permit-application-for-bwrx-300-smr\" target=\"_blank\">TVA requested a construction permit</a> to build on that site an SMR called the <a href=\"https://www.gevernova.com/nuclear/carbon-free-power/bwrx-300-small-modular-reactor\" target=\"_blank\">BWRX-300</a>, a boiling-water reactor, which would have a capacity of 300 MWe. But the site can accommodate additional SMRs and other advanced or microreactor units, which would fulfill the executive order\u2019s objectives.</p><h2>Clinch River Is Ideal for New Nuclear</h2><p>TVA was prescient in its thinking: Its stated objectives for the Clinch River site include powering mission-critical electricity loads for national defense, which aligns with the executive order\u2019s priorities. In fact, TVA\u2019s 2016 application assessed underground transmission lines to serve mission-critical loads on ORNL\u2014a design feature that makes it less susceptible to intentional destructive acts and natural phenomena such as tornadoes.</p><p>The area already hosts the DOE\u2019s largest electricity user, the <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/tema/prepare/technical-hazards/department-of-energy/about-the-oak-ridge-reservation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oak Ridge Reservation</a>, which includes ORNL and the <a href=\"https://www.y12.doe.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Y-12 National Security Complex</a>, where nuclear-weapons components are manufactured and highly enriched uranium is stored and processed. Historically, the region supported the K-25 uranium-enrichment facility, which consumed, until the 1980s, more than 1,000 MWe. Today, the robust power infrastructure built to serve K-25 remains available in Oak Ridge, including redundant 161- and 500-kilovolt  transmission lines that transect the Clinch River site.</p><p>East Tennessee is also home to one of the nation\u2019s deepest and most experienced nuclear workforces, with TVA, DOE, the University of Tennessee, and many private-sector nuclear companies including <a href=\"https://www.centrusenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Centrus Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://kairospower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kairos Power</a>, <a href=\"https://laseristech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LIS Technologies</a>, <a href=\"https://nanonuclearenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Nuclear Energy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.orano.group/usa/en/our-news/news-releases/2025/orano-opens-project-ike-office-in-oak-ridge-tennessee-to-support-developing-its-american-uranium-enrichment-facility\" target=\"_blank\">Orano</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.standardnuclear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Nuclear</a>, <a href=\"https://typeoneenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Type One Energy</a>, and <a href=\"https://x-energy.com/fuel/triso-x\" target=\"_blank\">X-Energy</a>, plus numerous smaller suppliers, all calling Oak Ridge home.</p><p>TVA has not, thus far, catered to data centers\u2014one of the Trump administration\u2019s priorities. But on 24 July the DOE named the Oak Ridge Reservation one of four locations where it will invite private-sector partners to <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-site-selection-ai-data-center-and-energy-infrastructure-development-federal\" target=\"_blank\">develop cutting-edge AI data-center and energy-generation projects</a>. An adjacent advanced-nuclear plant on the Clinch River site would pair nicely.</p><h2>TVA\u2019s New Nuclear Constraints</h2><p>This rare combination of attributes simply doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere, and makes the Clinch River site the ideal location to try to meet the provisions in the executive orders. But several challenges lie ahead.</p><p>TVA\u2019s status as a federally owned corporation comes with constraints that impede progress. Namely, a US $30 billion cap on the amount of debt it can take on was bestowed upon it through the <a href=\"https://www.tva.com/about-tva/our-history/the-tva-act\" target=\"_blank\">TVA Act</a> and hasn\u2019t been increased since 1979. TVA has been <a href=\"https://www.powermag.com/americas-nuclear-renaissance-how-the-tva-can-lead-our-energy-future/\" target=\"_blank\">accused of moving too slowly</a> in the development of advanced nuclear and SMRs, and Tennessee senators and the president have called for leadership change at the power provider.</p><p>Successful execution of the directive will require leadership within the Trump administration. It will require TVA to seek creative solutions and overcome its constraints. One option would be to transfer the Clinch River site and its permit from TVA to the DOE. Or perhaps the simplest solution is for the DOE to contract for power in a manner that enables third-party financing of new nuclear capacity, so that the debt doesn\u2019t fall on TVA\u2019s balance sheet.</p><p>Given the urgency, importance, and magnitude of the challenge of meeting the United States\u2019 growing electricity needs and to accomplish the intent of the executive orders<strong>,</strong> DOE should designate <em><em>both</em></em> INL and ORNL as locations to host new nuclear reactors.</p>"

There was no way to send text messages or other data over 1G networks. And interference from other radio signals made 1G coverage unreliable; there were plenty of dropped calls. Plus, without encryption, eavesdropping was a persistent problem.</p><h3>Seizo Onoe</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer:</strong></p><p>International Telecommunication Union</p><p><strong>Title:</strong></p><p>Director of the ITU\u2019s Telecommunication Standardization Bureau</p><p><strong>Member Grade:</strong></p><p>Life member</p><p><strong>Alma Mater:</strong></p><p>Kyoto University</p><p>In 1991 2G networks signaled the fledgling industry\u2019s switch to digital\u2014which improved security and broadened the range of features.

He says he was drawn to the \u201cdirectness\u201d of STEM subjects. He majored in engineering when he enrolled at <a href=\"https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kyoto University</a> in 1976.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my parents also suggested engineering because it was more advantageous for employment,\u201d he says.</p><p>He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1980 and an engineering master\u2019s degree two years later. As a graduate student, he worked on early digital mobile radio transmission.</p><p>The primitive equipment on which he cut his teeth\u2014repurposed (1.544 megabits per second) fixed-line hardware donated by industry\u2014sent out mobile radio signals at data rates that would be comparable to those of 3G someday, foreshadowing the digital mobile future.</p><h2>The debate behind the 3G standard</h2><p>Japan\u2019s <a href=\"https://group.ntt/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nippon Telegraph and Telephone</a> in 1979 launched the <a href=\"https://time.graphics/event/9603399\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s first 1G network</a>. In 1982 Onoe joined NTT\u2019s Yokosuka Electrical Communication Laboratory, in Yokosuka City. Starting his NTT career as a researcher, he helped develop the control signals necessary for call setup and other controls over an analog network.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, NTT\u2019s mobile services was a very small division,\u201d he recalls. Things really started changing in the early 1990s, he says.</p><p>In 1992 the company spun off its mobile division, <a href=\"https://www.docomo.ne.jp/english/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Docomo</a> (do communications over the mobile network). The name was popularly interpreted as a play on the Japanese word <em><em>dokomo</em></em>, which means <em><em>everywhere</em></em>.</p><p>Onoe was transferred to Docomo in 1992, when the company was founded, and was later promoted to executive engineer and director. NTT reacquired Docomo in 2020.</p><p>He contributed to 3G development, including work on a rapid cell search algorithm, which proved critical for network performance. The algorithm lets mobile devices quickly identify the nearest base station in a cellular network. And it didn\u2019t rely on other systems, like GPS, to locate the correct cell in a network\u2014making the process easier, faster, and less expensive.</p><p>His most challenging effort throughout the 1990s, he says, was including emerging digital cellular stakeholders worldwide\u2014including governments, telecom companies, and regulators\u2014to begin envisioning the infrastructure on which a truly global cellular network could be built.</p><p>That meant developing a single standard.</p><p>\u201cThere were many, many heated debates all around the world,\u201d Onoe says.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/changing-the-world/big-bang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">history articles</a> published online by <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/changing-the-world/big-bang/the-campaign-starts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ericsson</a>, the debates were <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/changing-the-world/big-bang/battle-on-several-fronts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">complex and contentious</a>. They involved entities from inside and outside the industry, including phone manufacturers, mobile service providers, standards boards, and government officials.</p><p>Europe alone was considering five different telecom infrastructures across the continent\u2019s numerous cellular networks, Onoe says, highlighting the divide around the world. Some companies and countries supported <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiple_access\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">time-division multiple access</a> (TDMA), which would split the available network bandwidth into time slots and assign users specific slots for transmission. Others were pushing a different access technology that is <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/difference-between-tdma-and-cdma/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partly competitive with TDMA and partly complementary to it</a>: code-division multiple access (CDMA), which uses unique codes to allow multiple users to share both bandwidth and time.</p><p>As if that emerging standards landscape weren\u2019t complicated enough, <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sony</a> championed yet another technology based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">orthogonal frequency division multiple access</a> (OFDMA).</p><p>In December 1997 the <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/changing-the-world/big-bang/drama-at-etsi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European Telecommunications Standards Institute</a> met in Madrid. At issue would be who controlled the standards for, at the time, the <a href=\"https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/ijclp/ijclp_3/ijclp_3b.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3G future</a>.</p><p>And that is when the fur really flew. The Nordic mobile manufacturers Ericsson and Nokia squared off in what were, according to <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/changing-the-world/big-bang/the-campaign-starts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ericsson\u2019s account</a> at least, \u201cincreasingly warlike circumstances.\u201d Britain\u2019s prime minister, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Blair</a>, who the above account said \u201cregarded Ericsson as a British company,\u201d took Ericsson\u2019s side in the squabbles. Other ETSI disputes aired at that meeting found their way into <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/delaware/dedce/1:2009cv00791/43078/207/1.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuits years later</a>.</p><p>None of the standards under consideration garnered enough votes to pass. A second vote would be held the following month in Paris\u2014and so the lobbying began anew.</p><p>At the Paris meeting in January 1998, the ETSI voted on W-CDMA as the dominant standard for the world\u2019s 3G networks. But in the spirit of compromise, the standards body also allocated a limited amount of 3G spectrum to TD-CDMA, a combination of the time-division and code-division methods.</p><p>Following that, in the final stage of the 3G standardization battle\u2014a debate between wideband CDMA and a similar access technology, CDMA2000\u2014Onoe emerged as a major player to help broker an agreement, as Japan at least <a href=\"https://www.rcrwireless.com/19980921/archived-articles/japan-caught-in-the-middle-on-3g\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hedgingly</a> supported the push for W-CDMA.</p><p>\u201cI decided to step in and join the war, so to speak,\u201d Onoe says. \u201cAcross all these countries and vendors and individuals fighting, it was clear we were going to have to come up with some compromises to finally agree.\u201d</p><p>Onoe helped lead an operators\u2019 harmonization group to do just that. It proposed changing the chip rate\u2014the frequency at which the smallest units of 3G code are transmitted.</p><p>With 3G politics addressed, the hard 3G engineering work then began in earnest.</p><p>\u201cWe had to start the development of the commercial system,\u201d Onoe says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully appreciated just how challenging that was going to be.\u201d</p><p>From 1999 until 2001, he says, he worked every day including weekends.</p><p>\u201cI would start meetings at midnight, summarize the day\u2019s activities, and plan for the next day,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine all these years later, but as a young and excited engineer, it was easy for me to do.\u201d</p><p>NTT became the first company to <a href=\"https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=2008\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">launch 3G commercially</a>, in October 2001. The new wireless standard vastly outstripped 2G\u2019s data rates.

Nigeria\u2019s big telecom operators continue to build long-distance, high-capacity fiber-optic networks from the cables to the important commercial nodes in the cities. But distribution to the urban peripheries and to rural places such as Atan is still incomplete.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Incomplete is an understatement: <a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Less than half</a> of the country\u2019s 237 million people have regular access to broadband, with that access mostly happening through <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/statistics-reports/subscriber-data#monthly-subscriber-technology-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mobile devices</a> rather than more stable fixed connections. Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy has set a goal to almost double the length of the country\u2019s fiber-optic backbone and for broadband to reach <a href=\"https://fmcide.gov.ng/ministry-launches-national-broadband-alliance-for-nigeria-nban-to-drive-broadband-connectivity-and-infrastructure-development/\" target=\"_blank\">70 percent of the population</a> by the end of this year. But the ministry also<a href=\"https://von.gov.ng/fg-launches-774-lg-internet-connectivity-project/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> claimed in 2024</a> that it would connect Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments to the broadband backbone; as of February 2025, it had reached only 51. The broadband buildout has been seriously hampered by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nigeria-power-grid\" target=\"_blank\">Nigeria\u2019s unreliable power grid</a>. Beyond the mere inconvenience of frequent outages, the poor quality of electricity drives up costs for operators and customers alike.</p><p>During a visit to Nigeria earlier this year, I talked to dozens of people about broadband\u2019s impact on their lives. For more than two decades, the country has possessed an incredible portal to the world, and so I had hoped to hear stories of transformation. In some cases, I did. But that experience was far from uniform, with much work left to do.</p><h2>Where Nigeria\u2019s broadband has arrived</h2><p>Broadband is enabling all kinds of changes in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country. All eight undersea cables make landfall in Lagos, the cultural, commercial, and one-time federal capital of Nigeria, and one of the cables also lands near Port Harcourt to the southeast.

On the other hand, streaming platforms made it easier for Nigerians to access foreign video content, cutting into local producers\u2019 market share.

The state-run telephone monopoly, Nigerian Telecommunications (Nitel), was mainly responsible for the rollout of SAT-3 within the country. Less than 1 percent of the 130 million Nigerians had phone lines in 2002, so the government established a second carrier, Globacom, to try to accelerate competition in the telecom market.</p><p>But a mixture of mismanagement and wider difficulties contributed to the sluggish spread of broadband, as<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\"> <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> reported in 2004</a>.

The spotty power grid means that standard telecom equipment needs backup power. But battery or diesel-powered cellphone towers attract theft, which in turn undermines network reliability.

NTEL backs up the grid electricity with a battery bank and two generators.</p><h2>In Nigeria, mobile broadband is popular</h2><p>What is often missing in Nigeria is the local connection, the last few kilometers leading to customers. In the developed world, that connection works like this: Internet service providers (ISPs) plug into the nearest backbone via one of several technologies and deliver a small slice of bandwidth to their business and residential customers. A switching station called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence\" target=\"_blank\">point of presence</a> (PoP) serves as an on- and off-ramp between the backbone and the ISPs. The ISPs are responsible for installing the fiber-optic cables that lead to their customers; they may also use microwave antennas to beam a signal to customers.</p><p>But in Nigeria, fiber-optic ISPs have been sluggish to capture market share. Of the country\u2019s<a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/internet-service-operator-data\" target=\"_blank\"> 300,000 or so fixed-line broadband subscribers</a>\u2014just 0.001 percent of Nigerians\u2014about a third are served by the leading ISP, <a href=\"https://spectranet.com.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectranet</a>. By comparison, the average fixed broadband penetration rate among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/broadband-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\">42.5 percent in 2023</a>, led by South Korea, with 89.6 percent penetration. </p><p>Starlink\u2019s satellite-based service, <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2025/starlink-nigeria-internet-elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced in Nigeria in 2023</a>, is now the second biggest broadband ISP, with about 60,000 subscribers. That\u2019s almost triple the third biggest ISP, <a href=\"https://fob.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">FiberOne</a>. Satellite is outcompeting fiber because it\u2019s more reliable and has <a href=\"https://www.ookla.com/articles/starlink-ssa-q1-2025\" target=\"_blank\">higher speeds and tolerable latency</a>, even though it costs more. A Starlink satellite terminal can serve up to 200 subscribers and retails for about US $200 plus a $37 monthly fee. A comparable fiber-to-the-home plan in Abuja, where the median monthly take-home pay is $280, costs about $19 a month.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a row of color display cases holding cellphones, with signs offering phone and laptop repair.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"57d0f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-row-of-color-display-cases-holding-cellphones-with-signs-offering-phone-and-laptop-repair.jpg?id=61426635&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In Lagos\u2019s Computer Village, you can buy or sell a mobile phone or computer, or get yours repaired.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>Meanwhile, Nigeria has <a href=\"https://ncc.gov.ng/subscriber-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">142 million cellular subscriptions</a>, and so most Internet users access the Internet wirelessly, via a mobile network. In other words, Nigeria\u2019s mobile market is nearly 500 times as big as the market for fixed broadband. The mobile networks also rely on the fiber-optic backbones, but instead of using PoP gateways, they link to cellular base stations, each of which can reach up to thousands of mobile devices but may not offer ideal quality of service. </p><p>Mobile Internet is a good thing for people who can afford it, which is<a href=\"https://datahub.itu.int/dashboards/umc/?e=NGA\" target=\"_blank\"> most Nigerians</a>, according to the <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/\" target=\"_blank\">International Telecommunication Union</a>. The cost of fixed-line broadband is still around five times as much, which explains why its market share is so tiny. But mobile Internet isn\u2019t enough to run many businesses, nor do mobile network operators guarantee network speeds or low latency, which are crucial factors for high-frequency trading, telemedicine, and e-commerce, and for white-collar jobs requiring streaming video calls.</p><h2>Nigeria is 129th in the world in Internet speeds</h2><p>Internet speeds across Nigeria vary, but broadband tester Ookla\u2019s spring 2025 median for fixed broadband was 28 megabits per second for downloads and 15 Mb/s for uploads, with latency of 25 milliseconds. That puts Nigeria 129th in the world for fixed broadband. In May, Starlink delivered download speeds between 44 and 50 Mb/s, uploads of around 12 Mb/s, and latency of around 61 ms. The top country, <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/singapore\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore</a>, averaged 393 Mb/s down and 286 Mb/s up, with 4 ms latency. And those numbers for Nigeria don\u2019t capture the effect of unpredictable electricity cuts.</p><p><a href=\"https://nileuniversity.edu.ng/staff/professor-steve-a-adeshina/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve A.

That\u2019s why he keeps two personal cellular modems on his desk. His university contracts with several Internet providers, but the broadband in his lab is still intermittent. For machine-vision research, with its huge datasets, failing to upload data stored on his local machine to the more powerful cloud processor where he runs his experiments means failing to work. \u201cWe have optical fiber, but we are not getting value for money,\u201d Adeshina says. If he wakes up to a failed overnight data upload, he has to start it all over again.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/modernizing-nigerian-voting-system\" target=\"_self\">The Engineer Who Secured Nigeria\u2019s Democracy</a></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Photo of tangled black cables spilling from a rectangular opening in the sidewalk, with street traffic and a distinctive tall building in the background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"05309\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-tangled-black-cables-spilling-from-a-rectangular-opening-in-the-sidewalk-with-street-traffic-and-a-distinctive-tall-bu.jpg?id=61426638&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Fiber-optic cable spills from an open manhole in Lagos. Local gangs may cut the cables or steal components. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>There are many causes for the slow Internet, but chief among them are frequent cable cuts\u2014<a href=\"https://www.thecable.ng/50000-incidents-recorded-in-2024-fg-sets-up-panel-to-address-telecoms-cables-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">50,000 in 2024</a>, according to the federal government. The problem is so bad that in February, the government established a committee to prevent network blackouts due to cable cuts during road construction, which it blamed for 60 percent of the incidents.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is reaching the hinterland,\u201d Aliyu of Phase3 Telecom says, and keeping lines intact once there. To make his point, Aliyu, dressed in a snappy three-piece suit and red tie, drives a company pickup truck from Phase3\u2019s well-appointed offices in a leafy part of Abuja to a nearby ring road. He pulls over in the shade of an overpass and steps onto the dirt shoulder. A concrete manhole cover sits perched along one edge of an open manhole, looking like the lid of a sarcophagus.</p><p>Pointing at the hole, Aliyu explains how easy it is for local gangs, called area boys, to steal components or cut the cables, forcing backbone providers and ISPs to strike unofficial security deals with the boys, or the more powerful, shadowy men behind them. Of course, part of the problem is self-inflicted: Sloppy work crews leave manholes open and expose the cables to potential damage from nesting animals or a stray cigarette butt that ignites tumbleweed and melts the cables.</p><p>Phase3 and other telecom companies are also contending with the expense of replacing the first generation of fiber-optic cables, now about 20 years old, as well as upgrading PoP hardware to increase capacity. They\u2019re spending money not just to reach new customers, but also to provide competitive service to existing customers.</p><p>For mobile operators such as Globacom, there\u2019s the additional challenge of ensuring reliable power for their base stations. They often rely on diesel or gasoline generators to back up grid power, but fuel scarcity, infrastructure theft, and supply chain issues can undermine base station reliability.</p><h2>How Nigeria\u2019s offline half lives</h2><p>The hamlet of <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/553626-special-report-inside-abujas-forgotten-communities-lacking-basic-amenities-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tungan Ashere</a> is 3 km northwest of the major international airport serving Abuja. To get here, you leave the highway and drive past cinder-block huts with traditional reed roofs. The side of the dirt road is adorned with concrete pylons waiting to be strung with power lines but still naked as the day they were installed in 2021. People here farm cassava, watermelon, yam, and corn. Some keep small herds of goats and cattle. To get to market, they can ride on one of a handful of dirt-bike taxis.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a plastic tarp covering a round green structure on a platform, with a group of people gathered inside.

The metal resonates, not quite like a church bell, but it serves a similar purpose. \u201cThe bell, it\u2019s to tell everybody to go to sleep, to wake up, if there\u2019s an announcement. It\u2019s an ancient way of communicating,\u201d explains Lukman Aliu, a telecom engineer who drove me here.</p><p>The concept of connectivity in the village differs from just a few kilometers away at the airport, where passengers can enjoy free high-speed Wi-Fi in the comfort of a caf\u00e9. Yet the potential benefits of affordable broadband access for people living in places like Tungan Ashere are enormous.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usman.isah.5205?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\" target=\"_blank\">Usman Isah Dandari</a> is trying to meet that need. He is a technical assistant at the <a href=\"https://citad.org.ng/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD)</a>, a nonprofit based in Kano, Nigeria. Dandari coordinates a handful of community networking projects, including one in Tungan Ashere. Better broadband here would help farmers track market prices, help students complete their homework, and make it easier for farmers and craftspeople to advertise their goods. CITAD uses a mixture of hardware, including Starlink terminals and cellular modems, to offer relatively reliable broadband to areas neglected by commercial operators. The group is also considering using Nigeria\u2019s national satellite operator, <a href=\"https://nigcomsat.gov.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">NigComSat</a>, and working with the Nigerian Communications Commission to lower the costs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a man in Nigerian garb standing in front of a seated group of mainly children who are looking at tablets.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"10785\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-man-in-nigerian-garb-standing-in-front-of-a-seated-group-of-mainly-children-who-are-looking-at-tablets.jpg?id=61426661&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Usman Isah Dandari [standing] coordinates several projects like the one in Tungan Ashere, to provide affordable broadband access.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Andrew Esiebo</small></p><p>A few meters away from the scrap-metal bell in Tungan Ashere is a one-story building painted rust red, topped with a pastel green corrugated metal roof and eight solar panels, which power a computer lab inside. There\u2019s no grid electricity here, but the solar panels are enough to run a CITAD-provided cellular modem, a few desktop computers, and a formidable floor fan some of the time.</p><p>Many of the people in the village once lived where the airport is now. The Nigerian government<a href=\"https://dailytrust.com/the-sad-story-of-communities-displaced-for-abuja-airport/\" target=\"_blank\"> displaced them</a> when it chose the region as the new federal capital territory in 1991. Since then, successive local governments have provided services piecemeal, usually in the runup to elections. The result is a string of communities like Tungan Ashere\u201410,000 people in all\u2014that still lack running water, paved roads, grid electricity, and reliable Internet. These people may live on the edge of Nigeria\u2019s broadband backbone, but they reap few of its benefits.</p><h2>A private undersea cable shows how to do it</h2><p>Not every undersea cable rollout has been fraught. In 2005, electrical engineer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funke_Opeke\" target=\"_blank\">Funke Opeke</a> was working at Verizon Communications in the United States. <a href=\"https://www.mtn.ng/\" target=\"_blank\">MTN</a>, an African telecom company, hired her to help it build its submarine cables. Then Nitel hired her to help manage its privatization. There, she saw up close how the organization was failing to get the Internet from SAT-3 into Nigerians\u2019 lives.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a woman seated at a table with her hands folded in front of her.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3565a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-woman-seated-at-a-table-with-her-hands-folded-in-front-of-her.jpg?id=61426663&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Funke Opeke founded MainOne to build Nigeria\u2019s first private undersea fiber-optic cable.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Osodi/Bloomberg/Getty Images</small></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a question of capital or return on investment, policy, or interest,\u201d Opeke says. Instead, officials favored suppliers offering kickbacks over those with competent bids.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity for a well-managed submarine cable, Opeke approached private investors about developing a cable of their own. The result is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_One\" target=\"_blank\">MainOne cable</a>, which arrived in Lagos in 2010 and is operated by the company of the same name. MainOne offered the first private competition to Nitel\u2019s SAT-3 and Globacom\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLO-1\" target=\"_blank\">Glo-1</a>, which began service in 2010. (MTN\u2019s two cables landed in Nigeria in 2011.)</p><p>At first, the MainOne cable suffered the same problem as the others\u2014its capacity wasn\u2019t reaching users. \u201cAfter we built, there was no distribution,\u201d Opeke, who\u2019s now an advisor with MainOne, says. So the company got its own ISP license and began building fiber links into major metro areas\u2014eventually <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/04/equinix-enters-africa-closing-the-us-320-million-acquisition-of-mainone\" target=\"_blank\">more than 1,200 km</a> in states near its undersea-cable landing site. It ended up offering a more complete service than originally intended, bringing the Internet from overseas, onshore, across Nigeria, and the last kilometers into businesses and homes, and it attracted more than 800 business clients.</p><p>MainOne\u2019s success forced the publicly held telecoms and the mobile providers to compete. \u201cThe mobile networks were built for voice, and they were not investing fast enough\u201d in data capacity, Opeke says. MainOne did invest, helping to create the broadband capacity needed for Nigeria\u2019s first data centers. It then diversified into data centers, and in 2022 sold its whole business to American data-center giant <a href=\"https://www.equinix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Equinix</a>.</p><p>Other companies, including the major mobile operators, also began building fiber between Nigerian cities, duplicating each other\u2019s infrastructure. The problem is they didn\u2019t offer competitive prices to independent ISPs that wanted to piggyback on those new fiber-optic links, says the telecom analyst Odufuwa.</p><p>And neither the public sector nor the private sector is meeting the needs of Nigerians at the bottom of the market, especially in rural communities such as Tungan Ashere and Atan. A crucial first step will be to improve the reliability of the electrical grid, Opeke says, which will help drive down costs for telecom operators and other businesses, and create a virtuous cycle for further growth.</p><p>Almost everyone <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> interviewed for this story said security is another challenge: If Nigerian states and the federal government could ensure the security of the infrastructure, telecom operators would invest more in expanding their networks. Building telecom infrastructure is well within the reach of Nigerian engineers. \u201cNigeria doesn\u2019t have a skill problem,\u201d Opeke says. \u201cIt has an opportunity problem.\u201d</p><p>If the bureaucrats, businesspeople, and engineers can overcome those policy and technical hurdles, the unconnected half of Nigerians stand to gain a lot. Reliable broadband in Atan would draw more young people to agriculture, says the farmer and sociologist Bolaji Adeniyi: \u201cIt will provide jobs.\u201d Then, like Adeniyi, maybe those young connected Nigerians will reconsider whether farming is just father\u2019s work\u2014perhaps it could be their future, too. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Special thanks to IEEE Senior Member John Funso-Adebayo for his assistance with the logistics and reporting for this story. </em></p>"

Even a 50 percent productivity boost is amazing, but a 3x increase is mind-boggling. So, what was her cause for concern?</span></p><p>She felt anxious that she wasn\u2019t actually learning, because she had delegated almost all the implementation work to AI tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot. The result was a shallow understanding of her work, which led to both anxiety and guilt.</p><p>Yes, I agreed, this was a cause for concern. You may be able to achieve more in the short term, but overuse of AI will eventually lead to career stagnation. This led to a broader conversation: How can we ensure our career success as we enter an era where AI is increasingly capable?</p><p>An IEEE paper titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/devtime-preprint-TSE19.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Daily Life of Software Developers</a>\u201c found that \u201cdevelopers spend surprisingly little time coding, 9 percent to 61 percent of the workday depending on the study.\u201d In my own experience as a senior engineer at companies like Pinterest and Meta, I probably spent about 40 percent of my time actually writing code. The remaining time was spent collecting information, reading documentation, helping coworkers, or debugging. As AI coding tools become more prominent, more of our time will shift away from simply writing code.</p><p>Therein lies the answer to adapting for the future: become amazing at \u201cfilling in the gaps\u201d for the work that the AI can do. Utilize AI for rote coding tasks, but maintain your critical thinking skills for the significant part of your job that goes beyond writing the code. Here are examples of premium skills going forward: </p><ul><li>Debugging and reviewing AI-generated code</li><li>Monitoring software and working with other teams (humans) to fix issues</li><li>Decomposing a business objective into smaller milestones that we could feed into an AI</li></ul><p>Returning to the Microsoft engineer, I told her that one indication of a healthy AI relationship is to have opinions about the output. You must be able to defend or critique the code generated by the AI tools. If not, you\u2019re at risk of being replaced by AI instead of being amplified by AI. A productivity drop (from a 300 percent efficiency gain back to 50 percent!) is a fine tradeoff to make, as long as you build an ownership mentality.</p><p>The ultimate currency in the workplace, both now and in the future, is trust. Are you trusted to be accountable for your work, or are you simply parroting what the AI is spitting out? Whether you\u2019re a new college grad or a seasoned engineer, you must evolve your role in the knowledge economy to become a productive collaborator with AI.</p><p>\u2014Rahul.</p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trump-international-students\" target=\"_blank\">International Students Are Turning Away From the U.S.</a></h3><p>The United States has long been a magnet for international STEM students.

Over the next year and a half, U.S. President Harry S. Truman resurrected the Office of Civilian Defense (which had been abolished at the end of World War II) and signed into law the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, which mobilized government agencies to plan for the aftermath of a global nuclear war. With the Cold War underway, that act kicked off a decades-long effort to ensure that at least some Americans survived nuclear armageddon. </p><p>As the largest civilian federal agency with a presence throughout the country, the U.S. Post Office Department was in <a href=\"https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/postal-service-role-in-civil-defense.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a unique position</a> to monitor local radiation levels and shelter residents. By the end of 1964, approximately 1,500 postal buildings had been designated as fallout shelters, providing space and emergency supplies for 1.3 million people. Occupants were expected to remain in the shelters until the radioactivity outside was deemed safe. By 1968, about 6,000 postal employees had been trained to use radiological equipment, such as the CD V-700 pictured at top, to monitor beta and gamma radiation. And a group of postal employees organized a volunteer ham radio network to help with communications should the regular networks go down.</p><h2>What was civil defense in the Cold War?</h2><p>The basic premise of civil defense was that many people would die immediately in cities directly targeted by nuclear attacks. (Check out <a href=\"https://alexwellerstein.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Wellerstein</a>\u2019s interactive <a href=\"https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nukemap</a> for an estimate of casualties and impact should your hometown\u2014or any location of your choosing\u2014be hit.) It was the residents of other cities, suburbs, and rural communities outside the blast area that would most benefit from civil defense preparations. With enough warning, they could shelter in a shielded site and wait for the worst of the fallout to decay. Anywhere from a day or two to a few weeks after the attack, they could emerge and aid any survivors in the harder-hit areas.</p><p>In 1957, a committee of the Office of Defense Mobilization drafted the report <a href=\"https://ia803201.us.archive.org/34/items/deteviv00unit/deteviv00unit.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Deterrence and Survival in the Nuclear Age</em></em></a><em><em>, </em></em>for President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Better known as the Gaither Report, it called for the creation of a nationwide network of fallout shelters to protect civilians. Government publications such as <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/familyfalloutshe00unitrich/mode/2up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The Family Fallout Shelter</em></em></a><em> </em>encouraged Americans who had the space, the resources, and the will to construct shelters for their homes. City dwellers in apartment buildings warranted only half a page in the booklet, with the suggestion to head to the basement and cooperate with other residents.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a man and a woman sitting in a small room that\\u2019s surrounded by cinder block walls.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b382\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-and-a-woman-sitting-in-a-small-room-that-u2019s-surrounded-by-cinder-block-walls.jpg?id=61330880&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This model fallout shelter from 1960 was designed for four to six people. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Bettmann/Getty Images</small></p><p>Ultimately, very few homeowners actually built a fallout shelter. But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Serling\" target=\"_blank\">Rod Serling</a>, creator of the television series \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_(1959_TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\">The Twilight Zone</a>,\u201d saw an opportunity for pointed social commentary. Aired in the fall of 1961, the episode <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shelter_(The_Twilight_Zone)\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Shelter\u201d</a> showed how quickly civilization (epitomized by a suburban middle-class family and their friends) broke down over decisions about who would be saved and who would not. </p><p>Meanwhile, President John F. Kennedy had started to shift the national strategy from individual shelters to community shelters. At his instruction, the <a href=\"https://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/Historical-Vignettes/Civil-Engineering/035-Preparedness/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers </a>began surveying existing buildings suitable for public shelters. Post offices, especially ones with basements capable of housing at least 50 people, were a natural fit.</p><p>Each postmaster general was designated as the local shelter manager and granted complete authority to operate the shelter, including determining who would be admitted or excluded. The <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/HandbookForFalloutShelterManagement\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Handbook for Fallout Shelter Management</em></em></a> gave guidance for everything from sleeping arrangements to sanitation standards. Shelters were stocked with food and water, medicine, and, of course, radiological survey instruments.</p><h2>What to do in case of a nuclear attack</h2><p>These community fallout shelters were issued a <a href=\"https://www.civildefensemuseum.com/cdmuseum2/radkits/cdv7771kit.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standard kit for radiation detection</a>. The kit came in a cardboard box that contained two radiation monitors, the <a href=\"https://www.civildefensemuseum.com/cdmuseum2/radkits/cdv700.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CD V-700</a> (a Geiger counter, pictured at top) and the <a href=\"https://www.civildefensemuseum.com/cdmuseum2/radkits/cdv715.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CD V-715</a> (a simple ion chamber survey meter); two cigar-size <a href=\"https://www.civildefensemuseum.com/cdmuseum2/radkits/dose.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CD V-742 dosimeters</a>, to measure a person\u2019s total exposure while wearing the device; and a charger for the dosimeters.

Then, within three minutes of finishing the indoor measurements, he would go outside and take a reading at least 25 feet (7.6 meters) from the building. If the radiation level outside was high, there were procedures for decontamination upon returning to the shelter. The \u201cprotection factor\u201d of the shelter was calculated by dividing the outside reading by the inside reading. (Today the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, recommends a PF of at least 40 for a fallout shelter.) Operators were directed to retake the measurements and recalculate the protective factor at least once every 24 hours, or more frequently if the radiation levels changed rapidly. </p><p>The CD V-700 was intended for detecting beta and gamma radiation during cleanup and decontamination operations, and also for detecting any radioactive contamination of food, water, and personnel. </p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pi-pico-gamma-ray-detector\" target=\"_self\">DIY Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy With a Raspberry Pi Pico</a></p><p>Each station would report their dose rates to a regional control center, so that the civil defense organization could determine when people could leave their shelter, where they could go, what routes to take, and what facilities needed decontamination. But if you\u2019ve lived through a natural or manmade disaster, you\u2019ll know that in the immediate aftermath, communications don\u2019t always work so well. Indeed, the <em><em>Handbook for Radiological Monitors </em></em>acknowledged that a nuclear attack might disrupt communications. Luckily, the U.S. Post Office Department had a backup plan.</p><p>In May 1958, <a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/a-postmaster-general-for-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfield</a> made an appeal to all postal employees who happened to be licensed amateur radio operators, to form an informal network that would provide emergency communications in the event of the collapse of telephone and telegraph networks and commercial broadcasting. The result was Post Office Net (PON), a voluntary group of ham radio operators; by 1962, about 1,500 postal employees in 43 states had signed on. That year, PON was opened up to nonemployees who had the necessary license.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ham-radio\" target=\"_self\">The Uncertain Future of Ham Radio</a></p><p>Although PON was never activated due to a nuclear threat, it did transmit messages during other emergencies. For example, in January 1967, after an epic blizzard blanketed Illinois and Michigan with heavy snow, the Michigan PON went into action, setting up liaisons with county weather services and relaying emergency requests, such as rescuing people stranded in vehicles on Interstate 94.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Vintage Civil Defense exhibit with equipment and a sign urging enrollment.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"dc081\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/vintage-civil-defense-exhibit-with-equipment-and-a-sign-urging-enrollment.jpg?id=61331391&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A 1954 civil defense fair featured a display of amateur radios. The U.S. Post Office recruited about 1,500 employees to operate a ham radio network in the event that regular communications went down. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">National Archives</small></p><p>The post office retired the network on 30 June 1974 as part of its shift away from civil defense preparedness. (<a href=\"https://www.arrl.org/ares\" target=\"_blank\">A volunteer civil emergency-response ham radio network</a> still exists, under the auspices of the American Radio Relay League.) And by 1977, laboratory tests indicated that most of the food and medicine stockpiled in post office basements was no longer fit for human consumption. In 1972 the Office of Civil Defense was replaced by the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency, which was eventually folded into FEMA. And with the end of the Cold War, the civil defense program officially ended in 1994, fortunately without ever being needed for a nuclear attack. </p><h2>Do we still need civil defense?</h2><p>The idea for this column came to me last fall, when I was doing research at the <a href=\"https://www.lindahall.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Linda Hall Library</a>, in Kansas City, Mo., and I kept coming across articles about civil defense in magazines and journals from the 1950s and \u201960s. I knew that the Smithsonian\u2019s <a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">National Postal Museum</a>, in Washington, D.C., had several civil defense artifacts (including the CD V-700 and a great \u201c<a href=\"https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:npm_2013.2011.98\" target=\"_blank\">In Time of Emergency</a>\u201d public service announcement record album). </p><p>As a child of the late Cold War, I remember being worried by the prospect of nuclear war. But then the Cold War ended, and so did my fears. I envisioned this month\u2019s column capturing the intriguing history of civil defense and the earnest preparations of the era. That chapter of history, I assumed, was closed.</p><p>Little did I imagine that by the time I began to write this, the prospect of a nuclear attack, if not an all-out war, would suddenly become much more real. These days, I understand the complexities and nuances of nuclear weapons much better than when I was a child. But I\u2019m just as concerned that a nuclear conflict is imminent.

Pakistan that year experienced the deadliest floods the country had ever seen. An estimated 33 million people were affected, and 20 million are still living in dire conditions. The floods damaged houses, hospitals, and electricity and road infrastructure.</p><p>With support from the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-board-dedicated-humanitarian-activities\" target=\"_self\">IEEE Humanitarian Technology Board</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/special-interest-group-on-humanitarian-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Special Interest Group on Humanitarian Technology</a>, and NUST, IEEE volunteers built 17 homes. They were equipped with solar-powered energy systems that provided electricity for lights, fans, and other basic equipment, ensuring long-term sustainability.</p><p>IEEE volunteers also provided vocational training to survivors, equipping them with practical skills in basic electronics and solar installation. Their efforts aimed to restore livelihoods, promote self-reliance, and empower people to launch home-based businesses.</p><p>In 2023 I worked with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-15th-anniversary\" target=\"_self\">EPICS in IEEE</a> to develop a <a href=\"https://epics.ieee.org/project/development-of-behavioral-therapy-metaverse-for-autistic-children-pakistan/\" target=\"_blank\">virtual reality\u2013based therapy platform</a> aimed at supporting behavioral development in children with autism. A team of undergraduate students developed the platform, which uses a VR headset to simulate behavioral and communication therapy scenarios within the metaverse. The platform is still being tested and validated.</p><p>Another EPICS in IEEE initiative I led involved designing and deploying a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMwmIrzmcrE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart fall-detection system</a> for elderly people in assisted-living facilities. The system uses 60-gigahertz radar sensors to monitor posture and alert caregivers in the event of a fall.</p><h2>Diversity and inclusion in engineering</h2><p>Promoting diversity and inclusion has been a vital part of my IEEE journey. Thanks to support from the <a href=\"https://ieee-cas.org/society-involvement/women-cas-wicas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Women in Circuits and Systems</a> group and the <a href=\"https://lamc-ieee.org/students/diversity-inclusion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE MTT-S diversity and inclusion ad hoc committee</a>, I have organized initiatives aimed at inspiring women and other underrepresented groups to pursue engineering as a career.</p><p>I was chosen as a <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/get-involved/ieee-members/stem-champions/#:~:text=The%20STEM%20Champion%20Program%20empowers,inspiring%20others%20to%20get%20involved.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STEM champion</a> this year in the <a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/get-involved/ieee-members/stem-champions/#:~:text=The%20STEM%20Champion%20Program%20empowers,inspiring%20others%20to%20get%20involved.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE TryEngineering program</a>. Champions work to do more STEM outreach and connect future engineers with IEEE resources.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">IEEE has been more than a professional network; it has been my launchpad for leadership, my platform for humanitarian impact, and my community of mentors.</p><p>I promote STEM education by engaging with preuniversity schools and organizing hands-on activities to spark curiosity and learning. Being a champion has been an enriching experience.</p><p>My belief in equitable access to education has been the cornerstone of my STEM outreach efforts. I have led more than 30 workshops in collaboration with 20 local nonprofits, benefiting more than 500 orphans and homeless children. The hands-on sessions covered radar, robotics, wireless communication, and other topics. Together with a team of IEEE student volunteers, we also trained teachers to replicate the activities in schools.</p><p>Through my work, I have had the opportunity to instill core ethical values in students living in underserved communities. This role has allowed me to advocate for both technical excellence and moral responsibility\u2014two pillars I believe are essential for building a better future through engineering.</p><h2>Collaboration is key</h2><p>A major turning point in my volunteer journey came in 2022 through the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/communities/geographic-activities\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Member and Geographic Activities</a> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-volt-marks-10-years\" target=\"_self\">Volunteer Leadership Training program</a>. The VoLT program is designed to deepen volunteers\u2019 understanding of IEEE\u2019s structure, products, services, and available resources. It also helps participants appreciate their role within local units and the broader organization while preparing them for leadership roles. VoLT participants complete a team project, in which they identify a problem, a need, an opportunity, or an area of improvement within their local organizational unit or the global IEEE. Then they develop a business plan to address the concern.</p><p>For me, the program provided clarity, confidence, and community. My team project\u2014an AI-based vestibule for IEEE\u2014was ranked second among the submissions. The program was more than just a training exercise; it was a catalyst for my growth as a structured, strategic, and succession-focused leader.</p><p>One of my most recent leadership opportunities was chairing the Towards IEEE Pakistan Council mini-conference in May. The event brought together executive committee members from IEEE sections and subsections across Pakistan to explore the formation of a national IEEE council to unify efforts with global IEEE practices.</p><p>I also spearheaded the establishment of the IEEE Islamabad Section <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-life-members-reconnect\" target=\"_self\">life member affinity group</a> and the IEEE Communications Society professional chapter.</p><p>I believe the active involvement of senior members is essential\u2014not only for their mentorship and wisdom but also to help the section reach new heights of excellence.</p><p>I strongly believe in cross-institutional collaboration\u2014which is why the IEEE Islamabad Section is actively partnering with organizations including the <a href=\"https://pakaero.com.pk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pakistan Aerospace Council</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theiet.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.imeche.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Institution of Mechanical Engineers</a> to amplify our impact on the engineering and scientific community. The partnerships will enable joint technical seminars and training workshops that broaden our outreach and strengthen our contributions.</p><p>Through international conferences, seminars, joint workshops, and collaborative projects, the IEEE Islamabad Section has engaged with leading electronics companies <a href=\"https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/home_48230.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rohde and Schwarz</a> of Munich and <a href=\"https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Keysight Technologies</a> of Everett, Wash., to promote innovation, skills development, and applied research. The collaborations enhance students\u2019 professional readiness and enable industry partners to connect with emerging academic talent and cutting-edge ideas.</p><h2>A leadership launchpad</h2><p>What started as a student membership has grown into a purpose-filled career-long journey. IEEE has been more than a professional network; it has been my launchpad for leadership, my platform for humanitarian impact, and my community of mentors. Every conference I organized, every child I taught, every family I supported, and every volunteer I mentored are chapters of my story, which IEEE helped write.</p><p>To all young engineers, students, and professionals reading this: IEEE is what you make of it. It can be merely a line on your CV, or it can be a compass that guides your career and character. When you align technical skill with empathy and pair leadership with service, you not only grow, you uplift others as well.</p><p>I invite you to <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/join\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">join, volunteer, and lead</a>. Somewhere, someone is waiting for a solution only you can create\u2014and IEEE can help you deliver it.</p><p>My journey has never been mine alone. It has been a collective effort powered by an extraordinary community. I look forward to continuing the mission together, as we strive to make IEEE not just a professional home but also a platform for lasting impact.</p>"

However, some players are placing their bets slightly closer to the ground.</p><p>Starting next year, Tokyo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/philosophy/technology/special/ntn-solution/haps/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>SoftBank Corp.</span></a> will be beaming a prototype 4G and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/internet-balloons-and-drones-look-to-rise-in-the-5g-era\" target=\"_blank\">5G phone and broadband service</a> from the <a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/stratosphere\" target=\"_blank\"><span>stratosphere</span></a> to Japanese end users. Floating 20 kilometers above the Earth, the company\u2019s airship-based mast will be using energy-regeneration tech and newly allocated spectrum. And the tech could ultimately pose a real, competitive threat to satellite-based platforms like Starlink.</p><p>The Japanese telecom giant announced <a href=\"https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/news/press/sbkk/2025/20250626_01/\" target=\"_blank\">last month</a> it had secured exclusive rights to deploy stratospheric, lighter-than-air craft over <span>Japan. SoftBank\u2019s p</span>recommercial airship \u201ctower\u201d delivering 4G and 5G cellphone service, the company said, will be coming in 2026. The solar-powered airship, developed by the Moriarty, N.M.\u2013based <a href=\"https://sceye.com/newsroom/\" target=\"_blank\">Sceye</a>, has already completed more than 20 successful test flights. In the same press announcement, SoftBank also described its plans to also use heavier-than-air, fixed-wing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/softbank-hopes-its-solar-internet-drone-will-soar-where-facebooks-and-googles-sank\" target=\"_self\"><span>uncrewed aerial vehicles</span></a> that the Japanese company has developed.</p><h3>A Technical Blueprint for the Stratosphere</h3><p>Unlike the SoftBank system\u2019s <span>fixed-wing signal repeaters, Sceye\u2019s airship will be an autonomously piloted cell tower operating below outer space but still above the weather. The airship will carry the same type of base station used in terrestrial cell towers (called </span><span>4G</span><span> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENodeB\" target=\"_blank\">eNodeB</a>/</span><span>5G</span><span> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_NR#gNodeB\" target=\"_blank\">g</a></span><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_NR#gNodeB\">NodeB</a></span><span>), which will comply with global broadband standards, as overseen by the </span><a href=\"https://www.3gpp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Third Generation Partnership Project</a><span>, or 3GPP.</span></p><p>\u201cThe mobile phone doesn\u2019t know the difference between our platform and a tower,\u201d says <a href=\"https://canso.org/contributor/mikkel-vestergaard-frandsen/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen</span></a>, Sceye\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe just plug into existing infrastructure and operate under the same 3GPP protocol.\u201d</p><p>Sceye\u2019s airship uses advanced antenna systems that enable precision steering of the signal. Also known as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bytes-beamforming-explained\" target=\"_self\">beamforming</a>, this 5G tech helps a network cover wide areas or, conversely, focus bandwidth down to a tighter cone, depending on demand. The company reports that its system\u2019s latency is below 20 milliseconds. That would put it ahead of Starlink, which delivers today a network <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/despite-starlinks-improved-speeds-it-still-misses-the-fccs-broadband-standard/\" target=\"_blank\">latency of 45 ms</a>, according to a recent survey. </p><p><span>\u201cThis is not a relay system. We are the base station, able to respond to network demand from the stratosphere,\u201d says Frandsen.</span></p><p>With a payload capacity of 250 kilograms and 10 kilowatts of onboard solar power capacity, the airship can power its telecom suite but also station-keep\u2014something that neither <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-did-alphabets-loon-fail-to-bring-internet-to-the-world\" target=\"_self\"><span>balloons</span></a> (which drift with the wind) nor fixed-wing UAVs (constrained by limited payload and power) can achieve. </p><p>Which is why Sceye\u2019s advances in materials have been crucial for high-altitude endurance flights. According to the company, the fabric comprising the airship\u2019s hull is five times as strong per unit mass as conventional high-altitude platform system (HAPS) materials. Sceye\u2019s material is also 1,500 times more gas-tight, as well as being more resistant to both UV and ozone damage. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of overlap between extreme sports like the America\u2019s Cup or Formula One and our work on HAPS,\u201d said Frandsen, who recruited engineers from both sectors. \u201cIt\u2019s all about pushing materials to the limit, safely.\u201d</p><p>But even using such a supermaterial for the airship\u2019s skin, staying aloft at an altitude of 20 kilometers demands further innovations toward greater efficiency. \u201cOn this kind of machine, about 30 percent of the weight goes to the structure, and another 30 percent to the energy system,\u201d says <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37398991100\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Vincenzo Rosario Baraniello</span></a>, Head of the Earth Observation Systems Unit at the Italian Aerospace Research Centre (<a href=\"https://www.cira.it/en\" target=\"_blank\"><span>CIRA</span></a>). \u201cImproving those technologies gives a competitive advantage\u201d.</p><p>Sceye\u2019s silvery dirigibles are built for endurance, capable of pointing into the wind, and remaining in their area of operation for months at a time. Ultralightweight and flexible <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ultrathin-solar-cells\" target=\"_self\"><span>solar skins</span></a> and high-density <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=batteries\" target=\"_self\"><span>battery packs</span></a> keep the equipment running overnight. While the system\u2019s temperature- and UV-shielded payload compartment can withstand extreme stratospheric conditions. The airship can reach altitude in less than 30 minutes, with a single craft able to <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11025605\" target=\"_blank\"><span>replace up to 25 ground towers</span></a>.</p><h3>Building on New Spectrum </h3><p>The time has come, says Nikolai Vassiliev, chief of the Terrestrial Services Department at the <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><span>International Telecommunication Union</span></a>, for stratospheric systems like Sceye\u2019s and SoftBank\u2019s prototype network.</p><p>\u201cWe have established power limits, coordination rules, and allocated harmonized bands,\u201d Vassiliev says. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to operators to deploy.\u201d</p><p>Until recently, high-altitude platforms like Sceye\u2019s and SoftBank\u2019s helium-filled airship <a href=\"https://www.army-technology.com/analyst-comment/haps-high-altitude-platform-systems-regulatory-trends\" target=\"_blank\">relied primarily on millimeter-wave spectrum</a>, including bandwidth between 47- and 48-gigahertz frequencies. Millimeter waves, though, have limited range and are notoriously <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8043031\" target=\"_blank\">vulnerable to rain and other inclement weather</a>. Which is why, in part, the <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/wrc-23/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>World Radiocommunication Conference</span></a> in 2023 opened up a number of microwave bands between <a href=\"https://hapsalliance.org/blog/advancing-global-connectivity-the-expanded-horizon-of-the-haps-spectrum/\" target=\"_blank\">700 megahertz and 2.6 GHz</a> for HAPS. </p><p>These lower-frequency bands effectively opened the way for direct-to-device connections from stratospheric airships and other high-altitude platforms. \u201cThe availability of harmonized, low-band spectrum for direct-to-device HAPS has fundamentally changed the business case,\u201d said Toshiharu Sumiyoshi of SoftBank\u2019s Ubiquitous Network Planning Division. \u201cWe can now deliver service with commercially available handsets.\u201d</p><p>Unlike <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2020254816A1/en\" target=\"_blank\">earlier high-altitude platforms</a> that acted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_High_Altitude_Relay_Platform\" target=\"_blank\">like signal relays</a>, Sceye\u2019s high-altitude towers will ultimately allow users to cross coverage zones without losing service, thanks to handovers between ground and aerial nodes. And that could look and feel to the end user much like everyday terrestrial 4G and 5G coverage.</p><p>SoftBank is still weighing how best to deploy Sceye\u2019s stratospheric platforms, whether as always-on infrastructure or as on-demand responders during emergencies and other periods of anticipated high demand. \u201cOur current plan aims for one aircraft to stay in the air for one year,\u201d says Sumiyoshi. \u201cBut both scenarios, continuous flight or launch in response to a disaster, are conceivable. And operational details will be finalized after precommercial testing in 2026, taking cost-effectiveness and multiuse options like remote sensing into account.\u201d</p><p>Baraniello says whatever form the deployment ultimately takes, it marks an important step forward. \u201cThe partnership between Sceye and SoftBank is significant,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows that these platforms have reached a level of technological maturity that allows them to be deployed operationally. From an aerospace-engineering standpoint, that\u2019s a big deal, and the market\u2019s interest will further push research, industry, and development forward.\u201d</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>UPDATE 1 Aug. 2025:</em></strong><span> <em>The story was updated to clarify the ITU\u2019s position on the <strong>harmonized</strong><span> bands it\u2019s allocated (the ITU\u2019s addition in <strong>bold</strong>) and to note that SoftBank and Sceye\u2019s airships are helium-filled. </span></em></span><br /></p>"

This goal has also proven to be valuable in my career growth.</p><p>We are living in an era where technology evolves quickly, and it is important that IEEE helps its members, volunteers, and customers stay current on the technology that is of interest to them.</p><p>In order to achieve career success, individuals need to focus on their professional development. IEEE has programs in place to help those who need to improve their soft and leadership skills. You can be the smartest person on a team, but if you are unable to effectively communicate your ideas, you most likely will not grow within your organization.</p><p>IEEE also holds incredible conferences and events globally that allow individuals to network and engage with those who have similar technical interests. This helps nurture new ideas and share best practices. When our members and customers develop a strong network, it can open the door to mentoring and job opportunities.</p><p>Lifelong learning opportunities help to build collaboration and engagement among technologists. Individuals from diverse backgrounds are able to share different ideas and create stronger technical communities.</p><p>I am a strong believer in preuniversity science, technology, engineering, and math outreach activities so that IEEE members can promote and help develop the next generation of technologists. I plan to devote additional resources to make sure that this happens more on a global scale.</p><p><em>This article was updated on 6 August 2025.</em></p>"

Today, right now, OpenAI is releasing its latest and greatest large language model, <a href=\"https://openai.com/gpt-5/\" target=\"_blank\">GPT-5</a>, and making it available through the <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/?model=auto\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> interface. According to OpenAI\u2019s leaders, the model brings unprecedented powers of reasoning, brings <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vibe-coding\" target=\"_blank\">vibe coding</a> to a new level, is better than ever at <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use\" target=\"_blank\">agentic AI</a> tasks, and comes with a raft of new safety features. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant step along the path of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/artificial-general-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">AGI</a>,\u201d said OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://x.com/sama\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Altman</a> at a press briefing yesterday, referring to the company\u2019s goal of creating artificial general intelligence.</p><p>Altman called it a major upgrade from OpenAI\u2019s prior models, saying that chatting with GPT-5 feels like talking to an expert with a Ph.D., no matter what topic you bring up. <span>\u201cHaving </span>this team of Ph.D.-level experts in your pocket, available all the time, to do whatever you need, is pretty cool,\u201d he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasturley/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Turley</a>, head of ChatGPT, said he thinks the most remarkable thing about the model is that \u201cit just feels more human. So when you\u2019re talking to this thing, it feels just a little bit more natural.\u201d</p><h2>Who Has Access to GPT-5?</h2><p>The new model is available to everyone via ChatGPT, including users of the free version. Paying users do get certain perks, like access to a more powerful version of the model. </p><p>The introduction of GPT-5 c<span>uts through the confusion over OpenAI\u2019s many large language models (LLMs) with different names and capabilities. Since November 2022, when ChatGPT debuted based on the GPT-3.5 model, the public has tried to keep up as OpenAI launched GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, and</span><span> the \u201creasoning\u201d models o1 and o3. The reasoning models use a technique called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chain-of-thought-prompting\" target=\"_blank\">chain-of-thought</a>, in which they work through a problem step-by-step to better answer difficult and sophisticated questions. </span></p><p><span>But people using the free version of ChatGPT haven\u2019t had access to those top reasoning models.</span><span> \u201cThis is, for most people on ChatGPT, the first real introduction to reasoning,\u201d said Turley, adding that they don\u2019t have to select anything to turn on reasoning capacity for harder queries.</span><span> \u201cThey don\u2019t even have to think about it because GPT-5 just knows when to think.</span><span>\u201d</span></p><h2>How GPT-5 Performs</h2><p><span>We\u2019ll know more about GPT-5\u2019s performance when OpenAI releases its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-system-card/\" target=\"_blank\">system card</a> today, which should contain information about how well it did on various benchmarks. For now, we\u2019re going on statements from its proud creators and a brief demo conducted during the press briefing. </span></p><p><span>As for those proud statements: The OpenAI team claims that GPT-5 is not only smarter and faster, it\u2019s also more trustworthy. They say that it has fewer <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination\" target=\"_blank\">hallucinations</a> (in other words, it doesn\u2019t make up random stuff as often), and that it\u2019s less likely to confidently put forth a wrong answer, instead being more likely to admit the limits of its own knowledge. </span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The latest LLM from OpenAI includes a suite of new and improved abilities</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">OpenAI</small> </p><p><span>Perhaps driven by a general sense that OpenAI has lost the lead when it comes to LLMs that can code (many people point to Anthropic\u2019s latest <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4\" target=\"_blank\">Claude models</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-ai-coding-tools\" target=\"_blank\">various specialized models</a> as the leaders), GPT-5 goes heavy on coding. Altman said that the model is ushering in a new era of</span><span> \u201csoftware on demand,\u201d in which users can describe, in natural language, an app they\u2019d like to create, and see the code appear before their eyes. </span></p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/duboisyann/\" target=\"_blank\">Yann Dubois</a>, an OpenAI post-training lead, conducted the demo. He prompted the model to write the code for a Web app that would teach his partner how to speak French, and specified that the app should include flash cards, quizzes, and an interactive game in which the user directs a mouse toward a piece of cheese to hear a French vocabulary word. \u201cB<span>uilding such a website would actually require a lot of work\u2014at least a few hours for a software developer, and probably more,\u201d Dubois said. </span></span></p><p><span>The journalists on the call watched as the model thought for 14 seconds, then began generating hundreds of lines of code. Dubois clicked a \u201crun code\u201d button and revealed a cheerful Web app called French Playground with the requested features. He even gamely chased the cheese around for a few seconds.</span><span><strong> </strong>\u201c<span>So it\u2019s actually pretty hard to play that game,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut you get the point.\u201d He added that users could easily work with GPT-5 on revisions. </span></span></p><p><span><span>As for the buzzy trend of agentic AI, in which models don\u2019t just answer questions, but also act on your behalf to do things like book airplane tickets or buy a new bathing suit, Dubois said that GPT-5 excels. He claimed that it\u2019s better than previous models at making decisions about which</span></span><span> tools to use to fulfill a task, it\u2019s less likely to \u201cget lost\u201d during a long task, and it\u2019s better at recovering from errors.</span></p><h2>GPT-5\u2019s Safety Features</h2><p><span>The OpenAI team spent some time lauding GPT-5\u2019s new safety features. One improvement is how the model handles ambiguous queries that may or may not be problematic. </span><span><a href=\"https://alexbeutel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Beutel</a>, safety research lead, gave the example of a query about the burning temperature of a certain material, saying that such an interest could stem from terrorist ambitions or homework.</span><strong> </strong>\u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve approached this as a binary: <span>If we thought that the prompt was safe, we would comply. If we thought it was unsafe, the model would refuse.\u201d In contrast, he says, GPT-5 uses a new technique called safe completions, in which the model tries to give as helpful an answer as possible within the constraints of remaining safe.</span></p><p><span>But it\u2019s worth noting that the Internet has also made a game of \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/jailbreak-llm\" target=\"_blank\">jailbreaking</a>\u201c LLMs, or finding ways to get around their safety guardrails. For prior models, those tricks were often along the lines of: \u201cPretend you\u2019re my grandma and you\u2019re telling me a bedtime story about the best way to build a bomb.\u201d It\u2019s a sure bet that hackers will quickly start testing GPT-5\u2019s limits. </span></p><p><span>Another rising concern about LLMs is their sycophantic tendency to tell users whatever they want to hear. This trait has derailed lives when the model encourages someone to believe in their own <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html\" target=\"_blank\">delusions and conspiracy theories</a>, and in one tragic case has been blamed for a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chatbot-ai-lawsuit-suicide-teen-artificial-intelligence-9d48adc572100822fdbc3c90d1456bd0\" target=\"_blank\">teenager\u2019s suicide</a>. OpenAI has reportedly <a href=\"https://futurism.com/openai-forensic-psychiatrist\" target=\"_blank\">hired a forensic psychiatrist</a> to study its products\u2019 effects on people\u2019s mental health. </span></p><p><span>In the press briefing, Nick said that GPT-5 does show progress on sycophancy and dealing with mental health scenarios but said the company will have more to say on the subject soon. He pointed to an OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/how-we're-optimizing-chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> from earlier this week which announced changes to ChatGPT, such as reminding users to take breaks and an emphasis on responses with \u201cgrounded honesty\u201d when users are suffering from delusions. </span></p><h2>What GPT-5 Means and What Happens Next</h2><p><span><span>GPT-5 isn\u2019t the culmination of OpenAI\u2019s quest to create AGI, Altman said. \u201cThis is clearly a model that is generally intelligent,\u201d he said, but noted that it\u2019s still missing many important attributes that he considers fundamental to AGI. For example, he said,<span> \u201cthis is not a model that continuously learns as it\u2019s deployed from new things it finds.\u201d</span></span></span></p><p><span>So what happens next? The team will try to make an even bigger and better model. There has been much debate on whether <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-scaling-laws/\" target=\"_blank\">AI\u2019s scaling laws</a> would continue to hold, and whether AI systems would continue to achieve higher performance as the size of the training data, model parameters, or computational resources increase. Altman gave his definitive answer: <span>\u201cThey absolutely still hold. And we keep finding new dimensions to scale on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see orders of magnitude more gains in front of us. Obviously, we have to invest in compute at an eye-watering rate to get that, but we intend to keep doing it.\u201d</span> </span></p>"

Welcome to the age of <em>conversational mobility</em>, where natural dialogue with your car is becoming as routine as checking the weather on a smart speaker.</p><h2>A new era of human-machine interaction</h2><p> This shift is more than a gimmick. Conversational interfaces represent the next evolution of vehicle control, allowing drivers to interact with advanced driver-assistance systems\u2014without fiddling with buttons or touchscreens. Automakers are embedding <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-generative-ai\" target=\"_self\">generative AI</a> into infotainment and safety systems with the goal of making driving less stressful, more intuitive, and ultimately safer. Unlike earlier voice systems that relied on canned commands, these assistants understand natural speech, can ask follow-up questions, and tailor responses based on context and the driver\u2019s behavior. <a href=\"https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">BMW</a>, Ford, <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en\" target=\"_blank\">Hyundai</a>, and <a href=\"https://group.mercedes-benz.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes-Benz</a> are spearheading this transformation with voice-first systems that integrate generative AI and cloud services into the driving and navigating experience. <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Grok</a>, by contrast, remains mostly an infotainment companion\u2014for now. It has no access to onboard vehicle control systems\u2014so it cannot adjust temperature, lighting, navigation functions. And unlike the approach taken by the early leaders in adding voice AI to the driving experience, Grok responds only when prompted.</p><h2>Mercedes leads with MBUX and AI partnerships</h2><p>Mercedes-Benz is setting the benchmark. Its <a href=\"https://group.mercedes-benz.com/innovation/case/connectivity/mbux-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes-Benz User Experience</a> (MBUX) system\u2014unveiled in 2018\u2014integrated generative AI via <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&amp;utm_campaign=GOOG_C_SEM_GBR_Core_CHT_BAU_ACQ_PER_MIX_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_091724&amp;utm_term=chatgpt&amp;utm_content=169187630042&amp;utm_ad=744024536836&amp;utm_match=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21714513245&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-IW-UVyNZJL7aRHqZVK3jZVmdW5v&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwhafEBhCcARIsAEGZEKI8kYjb4S5DQNUHsvk0MQR-pIuy8cT72uqtLycbnTk0J3g8N4Su_CgaAp4iEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bing</a> search engine, with a beta launched in the United States in June 2023. By late 2024, the assistant was active in over 3 million vehicles, offering conversational navigation, real-time assistance, and multilingual responses. Drivers activate it by simply saying, \u201cHey Mercedes.\u201d The system can then anticipate a driver\u2019s needs proactively. Imagine a driver steering along the scenic<a href=\"https://www.grossglockner.at/en\" target=\"_blank\"> Grosslockner High Alpine Road</a> in Austria, hands tightly gripping the wheel. If the MBUX AI assistant senses that the driver is stressed via biometric data, it will slightly adjust the ambient lighting to a calming blue hue. Then a gentle, empathetic voice says, \u201cI\u2019ve adjusted the suspension for smoother handling and lowered the cabin temperature by two degrees to keep you comfortable,\u201d At the same time, the assistant reroutes the driver around a developing weather front and offers to play a curated playlist based on the driver\u2019s recent favorites and mood trends.</p><p> A car with Google Maps will today let the driver say \u201cOkay, Google\u201d and then ask the smart speaker to do things like change the destination  or call someone on the smartphone. But the newest generation of AI assistants, meant to be interactive companions and copilots for drivers, present an entirely different level of collaboration between car and driver. The transition to Google Cloud\u2019s <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/app\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini AI</a>, through its proprietary MB.OS, platform enables MBUX  to remember past conversations and adjust to driver habits\u2014like a driver\u2019s tendency to hit the gym every weekday after work\u2014and offer the route suggestions and traffic updates without being prompted. Over time, it establishes a driver profile\u2014a set of understandings about what vehicle settings that person likes (preferring warm air and heated seats in the morning for comfort, and cooler air at night for alertness, for example)\u2014and will automatically adjust the settings taking those preferences into account. For the sake of privacy, all  voice data and driver-profile information are stored for safekeeping in the Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Cloud, the backbone that also keeps the suite of MB.OS features and applications connected.</p><h2>BMW: from gesture control to voice first</h2><p>Although BMW pioneered gesture control with the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.bmwusa.com/vehicles/7-series/sedan/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">7 Series</a>, it\u2019s now fully embracing voice-first interaction. At <a href=\"https://www.ces.tech/\" target=\"_blank\">CES</a> 2025, it introduced <a href=\"https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2025/newidrive.html\" target=\"_blank\">Operating System X</a>\u2014with <a href=\"https://www.thompsonbmw.com/bmw-intelligent-personal-assistant.htm\" target=\"_blank\">BMW\u2019s Intelligent Personal Assistant</a> (IPA), a generative AI interface in development since 2016\u2014that anticipates driver needs. Say a driver is steering the new iX M70 along an alpine roadway on a brisk October morning. Winding roads, sudden elevation changes, narrow tunnels, and shifting weather make for a beautiful but demanding journey. Operating System X, sensing that the car is ascending past 2,000 meters, offers a bit of scene-setting information and advice: \u201cYou\u2019re entering a high-altitude zone with tight switchbacks and intermittent fog.

In the bad-weather, alpine-driving scenario, Hyundai\u2019s AI assistant detects, via readings from vehicle sensors, that road conditions are changing due to oncoming snow. It won\u2019t read the driver\u2019s emotional state, but it will calmly deliver an alert: \u201cSnow is expected ahead. I\u2019ve adjusted your traction control settings and found a safer alternate route with better road visibility.\u201d The assistant, which also syncs with the driver\u2019s calendar, says \u201cYou might be late for your next meeting. Would you like me to notify your contact or reschedule?\u201d</p><p>In 2025, Hyundai partnered with <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a> to enhance this assistant using <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-twins\" target=\"_self\">digital twins</a>\u2014virtual replicas of physical objects, systems, or processes\u2014which, in this case, mirror the vehicle\u2019s current status (engine health, tire pressure, battery levels, and inputs from sensors such as cameras, lidar, or radar). This real-time vehicle awareness gives the AI assistant the wherewithal to suggest proactive maintenance (\u201cYour brake pads are 80 percent worn. Should I schedule service?\u201d) and adjust vehicle behavior (\u201cSwitching to EV mode for this low-speed zone.\u201d). Digital twins also allow the assistant to integrate real-time data from GPS, traffic updates, weather reports, and road sensors. This information lets it reliably optimize routes based on actual terrain and vehicle condition, and recommend driving modes based on elevation, road surface conditions, and weather. And because it\u2019s capable of remembering things about the driver, Hyundai\u2019s assistant will eventually start conversations with queries showing that it\u2019s been paying attention: \u201cIt\u2019s Monday at 8 a.m. Should I queue your usual podcast and navigate to the office?\u201d The system will debut in 2026 as part of Hyundai\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hyundaimotorgroup.com/news/CONT0000000000129799\" target=\"_blank\">Software-Defined Everything</a> (SDx)\u201d initiative, which aims to turn cars into constantly updating, AI-optimized platforms. </p><p>Speaking In March at the inaugural <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.news/eu/articles/press-releases/hyundai-motor-group-launches-pleos-25-conference.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pleos 25</a>\u2014Hyundai\u2019s software-defined vehicle developer conference in Seoul\u2014<a href=\"https://www.hyundai.news/uk/articles/press-releases/chang-hyeon-song-appointed-as-president-and-head-of-new-taas-division.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chang Song</a>, head of Hyundai Motor and Kia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/future-mobility/newsView/ked202401160016\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Vehicle Platform R&amp;D Division</a>, laid out an ambitious plan. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to achieve cloud mobility, where all forms of mobility are connected through software in the cloud, and continuously evolve over time.\u201d In this vision, Hyundai\u2019s Pleos software-defined vehicle technology platform will create \u201ca connected mobility experience expanding from a vehicle to fleets, hardware to software, and ultimately to the entire mobility infrastructure and cities.\u201d</p><h2>Tesla: Grok arrives\u2014but not behind the wheel</h2><p>On 10 July, <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk</a> announced via the <a href=\"https://x.com/\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> social media platform that <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> would soon <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-debuts-grok-ai-update-2025-26-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">begin equipping its vehicles with its Grok AI assistant</a> in Software Update 2025.26.

Voice queries are processed through xAI\u2019s servers, and while Grok has potential as a copilot, Tesla has not released any specific goals or timelines in that direction. The company did not respond to requests for comment about whether Grok will ever assist with autonomy or driver transitions.</p><h2>Toyota: quietly practical with AI</h2><p>Toyota is taking a more pragmatic approach, aligning AI use with its core values of safety and reliability. In 2016, Toyota began developing <a href=\"https://www.germaintoyota.net/what-is-toyota-safety-connect-columbus-oh/\" target=\"_blank\">Safety Connect</a>, a cloud-based telematics system that detects collisions and automatically contacts emergency services\u2014even if the driver is unresponsive. Its Hey Toyota and Hey Lexus AI assistants, launched in 2021, handle basic in-car commands (climate control, opening windows, and radio tuning) like other systems, but their standout features include minor collision detection and predictive maintenance alerts. Hey Toyota may not plan scenic routes with Chick-fil-A stops, but it will warn a driver when brakes need servicing or it\u2019s about time for an oil change.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A driving simulator with a large panoramic wall display and mechanical car body bolted to the floor.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5fd40\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-driving-simulator-with-a-large-panoramic-wall-display-and-mechanical-car-body-bolted-to-the-floor.jpg?id=61430935&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">UX concepts are validated in Hyundai\u2019s Simulation Room.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Hyundai</small></p><h2>Caution ahead, but the future is an open conversation</h2><p>While promising, AI-driven interfaces carry risks.

[Editor\u2019s note: The author conducted an interview with G\u00f3mez in Spanish and has provided translations for this story.]</p><p>The truck, manufactured by <a href=\"http://en.fsfeichi.com.cn/about/en/about.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Feichi Technology</span></a>,<a target=\"_blank\"></a> based in Foshan, China, was purchased as part of a $6.15 million public-private partnership called the <a href=\"https://www.mining3.com/corfo-launches-initiative-to-promote-hydrogen-adoption-in-chilean-industry/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Hidrohaul Technological Program</span></a>. Hidrohaul launched in 2024 as a four-year project to advance hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles by bringing together key government and industry players. Chile\u2019s <a href=\"https://corfo.cl/sites/cpp/web-ingles/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Production Development Corporation</span></a> put up $3.45 million in funding for the program. Globally, Walmart has committed to decarbonizing operations by 2040, with transportation as a major part of its sustainable distribution strategy, says G\u00f3mez.</p><p>\u201cHidrohaul is taking the first steps of this strategy by letting us test the country\u2019s first green-hydrogen truck under real-life conditions,\u201d says G\u00f3mez. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing us to gather lessons learned in order to subsequently scale up this technology<a target=\"_blank\"></a><a target=\"_blank\"></a><a target=\"_blank\"></a>.\u201d<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p>The truck has an expected range of 750 kilometers and can pull 49 tonnes while holding 75 kilograms of hydrogen fuel. But \u201cno truck is ever going to pull into the station empty,\u201d says <a href=\"https://its.ucdavis.edu/people/lewis-fulton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Lewis Fulton</span></a>, the director of the Energy Futures Program of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. To be on the safe side, Fulton says long-haul truckers typically avoid dipping below a quarter tank\u2019s worth of fuel. That puts the practical range for the Feichi truck at around 560 km.</p><p>Chile spans more than 4,200 km north to south, and Walmart operates nearly 400 stores across the country under several subsidiaries. The remote southern region of Punta Arenas is home to the company\u2019s southernmost store in the world and is located nearly 3,000 km from Quilicura, which is currently the truck\u2019s only refueling source. Despite the company\u2019s plans to expand green-hydrogen production to all of its soon-to-be <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/12/16/investing-in-chiles-future-walmarts-five-year-commitment-to-growth-in-chilean-communities\" target=\"_blank\"><span>nine</span></a> distribution centers throughout the country, most of the network, including Punta Arenas, is still out of range.</p><p>The calculus that determines where hydrogen refueling stations should go changes based on the number of trucks, the capacity of each refueling center, and how far the trucks regularly have to travel to deliver their payloads. In California, Fulton and his team of researchers determined that 15 to 20 refueling stations spread across the state would offer both the geographic coverage and quantity of hydrogen to handle 5,000 heavy-duty trucks. The state leads the United States in <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-04-24/the-first-big-rig-hydrogen-fuel-station-in-the-u-s-opens-in-california\" target=\"_blank\"><span>fuel cell vehicle deployment</span></a>.</p><p>From north to south, Chile is about four times as long as the state of California. G\u00f3mez says Walmart is considering installing at least four hydrogen-fuel dispensers at its distribution centers to provide sufficient fuel capacity. At least to start, the truck will remain in central Chile to carry out its test routes.</p><p>\u201cThe plan is for the trucks to carry real merchandise loads from the Quilicura Distribution Center and supply stores within the Metropolitan, Valpara\u00edso, and O\u2019Higgins regions,\u201d G\u00f3mez says.<strong></strong></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\"></a>Global Deployment of Hydrogen Trucks</h2><p>Chile joins a handful of other countries who have deployed hydrogen fuel cell trucks for long-haul trucking, including the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, and several members of the European Union. China leads the pack in terms of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, with a <a href=\"https://www.hydrogeninsight.com/transport/chinese-state-owned-oil-giant-launches-countrys-first-cross-regional-hydrogen-trucking-corridor/2-1-1807653\" target=\"_blank\"><span>targeted 25,000</span></a> expected on the roads by the end of this year, according to the Chinese government. That figure is still a relatively small share of the total heavy-duty vehicles operating in the Chinese market.</p><p><span>Globally, high costs have limited the deployment of green-hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks at the industrial scale. While Chile may fare better on this front than the United States and other European countries, in part because of its </span><a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2024/09/china-is-gobbling-up-chiles-energy-sector/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>relationship with China</span></a><span>, the country\u2019s mountainous and remote terrain poses a unique hurdle for truck performance.</span></p><p><span>\u201cHills are a big thing,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://tsrc.berkeley.edu/timothy-lipman-phd\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Timothy Lipman</span></a> of the<span> University of California, Berkeley, who works with Fulton on research related to the rollout of fuel cell trucks in California. \u201cIf the topography is totally flat, you\u2019re going to get a longer range and need less fuel than if you\u2019re going over really steep hills.\u201d Extreme hot and cold weather can also impact a fuel-cell truck\u2019s battery and reduce efficiency over time, Lipman says.</span></p><p><span>Thus far, Chile has embraced local hydrogen power in its efforts to phase out sales of carbon-emitting heavy-duty vehicles </span><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/policies/14381-national-electromobility-strategy\" target=\"_blank\"><span>by 2045</span></a><span>. Yet as the country invests more resources into scaling up its green hydrogen market, Fulton notes that other low emissions technologies, like electric batteries, may become less feasible.</span></p><p><span>\u201cYou can only concentrate on so many technologies,\u201d Fulton says. \u201cSo if a country or a state makes a strong commitment to one or two technologies, eventually, maybe it gets harder to think about other ones.\u201d</span></p>"
