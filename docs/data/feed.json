        "summary": "Declining U.S. college enrollments over the past 15 years have triggered questions about the health of the postsecondary sector. Using institution-level data, we make four points. First, such declines are driven not by the four-year sector but by two-year community colleges, which have apparently shrunk by over 30% since the peak of the Great Recession. Second, over one-third of this apparent decline is an artifact of some community colleges being reclassified as offering four-year degrees. Third, pre-Great Recession data shows a 1 percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate increases first-time community college enrollment by 2 percent, suggesting many students are on the margin between community college and job opportunities. For-profit college enrollments are similarly countercyclical, while public and private four-year college enrollments appear acyclical. Our estimates suggest that strengthening labor markets explain about 60% of the post-Great Recession decline in first-time community college enrollment. Fourth, students whose enrollment decisions are most sensitive to labor market conditions appear unlikely to have completed a degree. Though declining community college enrollments are a challenge for postsecondary institutions, it is less clear whether they signal a problem for students on the margin of enrollment."

        "summary": "This paper characterizes the equity\u2013efficiency tradeoff of corporate taxation using a stylized model that draws on the corporate investment and tax incidence literatures. We derive optimal corporate tax formulas in terms of estimable reduced-form elasticities and welfare weights on workers and firm owners. While much empirical work emphasizes investment responses, these elasticities do not feature in optimal tax formulas. The elasticity of taxable profits is a sufficient statistic for the efficiency costs of the corporate tax. Higher corporate tax rates are desirable when firm owners have low welfare weights, and less desirable when taxing profits reduces wages. These empirical objects remain central across extensions, including heterogeneous production technologies, tax sheltering, international capital mobility, monopsony, and linear labor income taxes. We survey the empirical literature and find that existing estimates can support a wide range of optimal tax rates. An inverse-optimum analysis provides combinations of welfare weights of workers and firm owners that would rationalize the post-2017 US corporate tax cut as optimal."

        "summary": "We study the rapid expansion of Brazil's private online higher-education sector and its effects on market structure and college enrollment. Exploiting regional and field-specific variation in online education penetration, we find that online programs expand access for older students but divert younger students from higher-quality in-person programs. Greater competition lowers tuition prices but also reduces the supply of in-person degrees. Using an equilibrium model of college education, we show that in the absence of online programs, total enrollment would be 14 percent lower, while in-person enrollment would rise by 33 percent. On net, aggregate labor-market value added declines by 1.4 percent. Online education raises value added for older students, who benefit from increased access, but lowers it for younger students, who shift toward lower-return online options. Counterfactual policies that restrict online enrollment to older cohorts could increase value added for younger students without reducing gains for older cohorts."

I noted then, and it\u2019s still true two decades later: Software failures are universally unbiased. They happen in every country, to large companies and small. They happen in commercial, nonprofit, and governmental organizations, regardless of status or reputation.</p><p>Global IT spending has more than tripled in constant 2025 dollars since 2005, from US $1.7 trillion to $5.6 trillion, and continues to rise. Despite additional spending, software success rates have not markedly improved in the past two decades. The result is that the business and societal costs of failure continue to grow as software proliferates, permeating and interconnecting every aspect of our lives.</p><p>For those hoping AI software tools and coding copilots will quickly make large-scale IT software projects successful, forget about it. For the foreseeable future, there are hard limits on what AI can bring to the table in controlling and managing the myriad intersections and trade-offs among systems engineering, project, financial, and business management, and especially the organizational politics involved in any large-scale software project. Few IT projects are displays of rational decision-making from which AI can or should learn. As software practitioners know, IT projects suffer from enough management hallucinations and delusions without AI adding to them.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>As I noted 20 years ago, the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">drivers of software failure</a> frequently are failures of human imagination, unrealistic or unarticulated project goals, the inability to handle the project\u2019s complexity, or unmanaged risks, to name a few that today still regularly cause IT failures. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Numerous others</a> go back decades, such as those identified by Stephen Andriole, the chair of business technology at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University</a>\u2019s School of Business, in the diagram below first published in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forbes</em></a> in 2021. Uncovering a software system failure that has gone off the rails in a unique, previously undocumented manner would be surprising because the overwhelming majority of software-related failures involve avoidable, known failure-inducing factors documented in hundreds of after-action reports, academic studies, and technical and management books for decades. Failure d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu dominates the literature.</p><p>The question is, why haven\u2019t we applied what we have repeatedly been forced to learn?</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram showing causes of technology project failures: definition, scope, management, culture, etc.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"88b4c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-showing-causes-of-technology-project-failures-definition-scope-management-culture-etc.png?id=62207045&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><h2>The Phoenix That Never Rose</h2><p>Many of the<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lessons-from-a-decade-of-it-failures/read-more\" target=\"_self\"> IT developments and operational failures</a> I have analyzed over the last 20 years have each had their own Chernobyl-like meltdowns, spreading reputational radiation everywhere and contaminating the lives of those affected<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/five-enduring-government-it-failures\" target=\"_self\"> for years</a>.

DevOps strives to accomplish this continuously throughout the entire software life cycle. While <a href=\"https://www.smartsheet.com/content/agile-project-management-examples?srsltid=AfmBOooBlS_5SsIPzh-qOihGw1aTGItPHuhq8XMXWdcrAFVIxBQqrNos\" target=\"_blank\">Agile</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@maeydhaw/case-study-how-netflix-became-a-master-of-devops-7f6f6fa8ad86\" target=\"_blank\">DevOps</a> have proved successful for many organizations, they also have their share of controversy and pushback. Provocative reports claim Agile projects have a <a href=\"https://www.engprax.com/post/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds/\" target=\"_blank\">failure rate of up to 65 percent</a>, while others claim up to <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/most-devops-plans-fail-but-things-are-getting-better/#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20from%20analyst,today's%20DevOps%20struggles%20and%20challenges.\" target=\"_blank\">90 percent of DevOps initiatives fail to meet organizational expectations</a>.</p><p>It is best to be wary of these claims while also acknowledging that successfully implementing Agile or DevOps methods takes consistent leadership, organizational discipline, patience, investment in training, and culture change. However, the same requirements have always been true when introducing any new software platform. Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices, it is not surprising that novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems, no matter how effective they may be, will also frequently fall short.</p><h2>Persisting in Foolish Errors<br /></h2><p>The frustrating and perpetual question is why basic IT project-management and governance mistakes during software development and operations continue to occur so often, given the near-total societal reliance on reliable software and an extensively documented history of failures to learn from? Next to electrical infrastructure, with which IT is increasingly merging into a mutually codependent relationship, the failure of our computing systems is an existential threat to modern society.</p><p>Frustratingly, the IT community <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7842842\" target=\"_blank\">stubbornly fails to learn</a> from prior failures. IT project managers <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/03/the-uniqueness-trap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely claim</a> that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant. In Phoenix\u2019s case, for example, it was the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/bagnall-there-were-lessons-that-might-have-prevented-the-phoenix-pay-disaster-no-one-listened\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second payroll-system replacement attempt</a>, the first effort ending in failure in 1995. Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it\u2019s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.</p><h3>Jaguar Land Rover</h3><br /><img alt=\"The exterior of a building holds Jaguar and LandRover sign\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"04834\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-exterior-of-a-building-holds-jaguar-and-landrover-sign.png?id=62209560&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>A cyberattack forced Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s largest automaker, to shut down its global operations for over a month. An initial FAIR-MAM assessment, a cybersecurity-cost-model, estimates the loss for Jaguar Land Rover to be between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion (\u00a3911 million and \u00a31.4 billion), which has affected its 33,000 employees and some 200,000 employees of its suppliers. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html\" target=\"_blank\">gales of creative destruction</a>.\u201d They\u2019re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/278677/enterprise-resource-planning-10-famous-erp-disasters-dustups-and-disappointments.html\" target=\"_blank\">enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures</a> are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.</p><p>Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT project mismanagement. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995\u2019s payroll-project fiasco? <a href=\"https://www.thealbertan.com/national-news/fixing-problems-with-phoenix-payroll-system-cost-taxpayers-51-billion-official-10851998\" target=\"_blank\">The government maintains it will learn</a>, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure\u2019s high political profile. But will Phoenix\u2019s lessons extend to the <a href=\"https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_202310_07_e_44340.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of outdated Canadian government IT systems</a> needing replacement or modernization? Hopefully, but hope is not a methodology, and purposeful action will be necessary.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The IT community has striven mightily for decades to make the incomprehensible routine. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Repeatedly making the same mistakes and expecting a different result is not learning. It is a farcical absurdity. Paraphrasing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Petroski\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Petroski</a> in his book <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/To_Engineer_is_Human/_YWvcD-SFAgC?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design</em></a> (Vintage, 1992), we may have learned how to calculate the software failure due to risk, but we have not learned how to calculate to eliminate the failure of the mind.<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/us-coast-guards-67-million-ehr-fiasco\" target=\"_self\"> </a>There are a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/us-coast-guards-67-million-ehr-fiasco\" target=\"_self\">plethora of examples</a> of projects like Phoenix that failed in part due to bumbling management, yet it is extremely difficult to find software projects managed professionally that still failed.

Hints of what might happen if past lessons go unheeded are found in the spectacular early automated decision-making failure of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/michigans-midas-unemployment-system-algorithm-alchemy-that-created-lead-not-gold\" target=\"_self\"> Michigan\u2019s MiDAS unemployment</a> and <a href=\"https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/system/files/2023-09/rrc-accessible-full-report.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Australia\u2019s Centrelink \u201cRobodebt\u201d welfare systems</a>. Both used questionable algorithms to identify deceptive payment claims without human oversight. State officials used MiDAS to accuse tens of thousands of Michiganders of unemployment fraud, while Centrelink officials falsely accused hundreds of thousands of Australians of being welfare cheats. Untold numbers of lives will never be the same because of what occurred. Government officials in Michigan and Australia placed far too much trust in those algorithms. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors\u2019 impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed \u201cmaladministration,\u201d <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057305\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">administrative evil</a> is closer to reality.</p><h3>Lidl Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</h3><br /><img alt=\"The facade of a LIDL food supermarket on a sunny day.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c5f7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-facade-of-a-lidl-food-supermarket-on-a-sunny-day.png?id=62207832&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2017 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>The international supermarket chain Lidl decides to revert to its homegrown legacy merchandise-management system after three years of trying to make SAP\u2019s \u20ac500 million enterprise resource planning (ERP) system work properly. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If this behavior happens in government organizations, does anyone think profit-driven companies whose AI-driven systems go wrong are going to act any better?

If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a cybersecurity threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and systems development, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve. This not only means providing the personnel, financial resources, and leadership support and commitment, but also the professional and personal accountability they demand.</p><h3>F-35 Joint Strike Fighter</h3><br /><img alt=\"F-35 fighter jet flying with afterburners lit against a blue sky with scattered clouds.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"215ef\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/f-35-fighter-jet-flying-with-afterburners-lit-against-a-blue-sky-with-scattered-clouds.png?id=62209630&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025</strong></p><p>Software and hardware issues with the F-35 Block 4 upgrade continue unabated.

It will take years more to rollout the capability to the F-35 fleet.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It is well known that honesty, skepticism, and ethics are essential to achieving project success, yet they are often absent. Only senior management can demand they exist. For instance, honesty begins with the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808603368\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">forthright accounting</a> of the myriad of risks involved in any IT endeavor, not their rationalization. It is a common \u201csecret\u201d that it is far easier to get funding to fix a troubled software development effort than to ask for what is required up front to address the risks involved. Vendor <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8364440\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">puffery</a> may also be legal, but that means the IT customer needs <a href=\"https://csdl-downloads.ieeecomputer.org/mags/co/2024/11/10718683.pdf?Expires=1749318541&amp;Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jc2RsLWRvd25sb2Fkcy5pZWVlY29tcHV0ZXIub3JnL21hZ3MvY28vMjAyNC8xMS8xMDcxODY4My5wZGYiLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE3NDkzMTg1NDF9fX1dfQ__&amp;Signature=mL9v2PDZegXaIyUtFxUhKbp3FdpiW9v9dtWmGzdl9fDmhlRleA25D7IMUwVSezmGnCEalvPnY~uWI8jmDIyd-O3NLGv7~xcKEeqsptxR90hRojhxVZQ0LK2xp5TfQ9LbaWifuXCRCifA4KnGq-mg9yYpFMKnsjBKJp67u5gHHYElV3NBuODy1GYjMflkztyZQcqOHkx2zU5DazT5WgjD76RXYlwF-M9TKk7YdQoW-05OgxNovNL9gq2SJ9Q3tQRtx8uHwxPzjeGKqGJbahqwiaZNKowR7e1fK5uOy02ivsOeel0EQohoyrX305LMyK98hGVSn64c7kS55pFS-TcDHg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K12PMWTCQBDMDT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a healthy skepticism</a> of the typically too-good-to-be-true promises vendors make.

Alas, ethical considerations have <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9464106\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely lagged</a> when technological progress and profits are to be made. This practice must change, especially as AI is routinely injected into automated systems.</p><p>In the AI community, there has been a movement toward the idea of <a href=\"https://hcil.umd.edu/human-centered-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">human-centered AI</a>, meaning AI systems that prioritize human needs, values, and well-being. This means trying to anticipate where and when AI can go wrong, move to eliminate these situations, and build in ways to mitigate the effects if they do happen. This concept requires application to every IT system\u2019s effort, not just AI.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices...novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems...will also frequently fall short.</p><p><span>Finally, project cost-benefit justifications of software developments rarely consider the financial and emotional distress placed on end users of IT systems when something goes wrong.

Charette can be pretty depressing. Charette, who has been writing about software failures for this magazine for the past 20 years, is a renowned risk analyst and systems expert who over the course of a 50-year career has seen more than his share of delusional thinking among IT professionals, government officials, and corporate executives, before, during, and after massive software failures.</p><p>In 2005\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">Why Software Fails</a>,\u201d in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, a seminal article documenting the causes behind large-scale software failures, Charette noted, \u201cThe biggest tragedy is that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-failure\" target=\"_self\">software failure</a> is for the most part predictable and avoidable. Unfortunately, most organizations don\u2019t see preventing failure as an urgent matter, even though that view risks harming the organization and maybe even destroying it. Understanding why this attitude persists is not just an academic exercise; it has tremendous implications for business and society.\u201d</p><p>Two decades and several trillion wasted dollars later, he finds that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures\" target=\"_blank\">people are making the same mistakes</a>. They claim their project is unique, so past lessons don\u2019t apply. They underestimate complexity. Managers come out of the gate with unrealistic budgets and timelines. Testing is inadequate<strong> </strong>or skipped entirely. Vendor promises that are too good to be true are taken at face value. Newer development approaches like DevOps or AI copilots are implemented without proper training or the organizational change necessary to make the most of them.</p><p>What\u2019s worse, the huge impacts of these missteps on end users aren\u2019t fully accounted for. When the Canadian government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aurO_LK6DEI\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix paycheck system</a> initially failed, for instance, the developers glossed over the protracted financial and emotional distress inflicted on tens of thousands of employees receiving erroneous paychecks; problems persist today, nine years later. Perhaps that\u2019s because, as Charette told me recently, IT project managers don\u2019t have professional licensing requirements and are rarely, if ever, held legally liable for software debacles.</p><p>While medical devices may seem a far cry from giant IT projects, they have a few things in common. As Special Projects Editor Stephen Cass uncovered in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/medical-device-recalls\" target=\"_blank\">The Data</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalls</a> on average 20 medical devices per month due to software issues.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity. We would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem having AWS go down.\u201d <strong>\u2014Robert N. Charette</strong></p><p>Like IT projects, medical devices face fundamental challenges posed by software complexity. Which means that testing, though rigorous and regulated in the medical domain, can\u2019t possibly cover every scenario or every line of code. The major difference between failed medical devices and failed IT projects is that a huge amount of liability attaches to the former.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re building software for medical devices, there are a lot more standards that have to be met and a lot more concern about the consequences of failure,\u201d Charette observes. \u201cBecause when those things don\u2019t work, there\u2019s tort law available, which means manufacturers are on the hook. It\u2019s much harder to bring a case and win when you\u2019re talking about an electronic payroll system.\u201d</p><p>Whether a software failure is hyperlocal, as when a medical device fails inside your body, or spread across an entire region, like when an airline\u2019s ticketing system crashes, organizations need to dig into the root causes and apply those lessons to the next device or IT project if they hope to stop history from repeating itself.</p><p>\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity,\u201d Charette says. \u201cWe would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem accepting AWS going down or telcos or banks going out.\u201d He lets out a heavy sigh worthy of A.A. Milne\u2019s Eeyore. \u201cPeople just kind of shrug their shoulders.\u201d</p>"

These initiatives encompass a wide range of efforts, including<a href=\"https://move.ieeeusa.org/about/stem-outreach/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> STEM outreach</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeht.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> humanitarian technology deployments</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeusa.org/public-policy/priorities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> public education on emerging technologies</a>, and<a href=\"https://sustainable-climate.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> sustainability</a>. Unlike many efforts advancing technology, these initiatives are not designed with financial opportunity in mind. Instead, they fulfill IEEE\u2019s designation as a 501(c)(3) public charity engaged in scientific and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/microcredentials\" target=\"_blank\">educational activities</a> for the benefit of the engineering community and the public.</p><h3>Building a Better World</h3><br /><p>Across the globe, IEEE members and volunteers dedicate their time and use their talents, experiences, and expertise to lead, organize, and drive activities to advance technology for humanity. The<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/social-impact-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Social Impact</a> report showcases a selection of recent projects and initiatives that support that mission.</p><p>In my March column, I described my vision for One IEEE, which is aimed at empowering IEEE\u2019s diverse units to work together in ways that magnify their individual and collective impact. Within the framework of One IEEE, public imperative activities are not peripheral; they are central to unifying the organization and amplifying our global relevance. Across IEEE\u2019s varied regions, societies, and technical communities, these activities align efforts around a shared mission. They provide our members from different disciplines and geographies the opportunity to collaborate on projects that transcend boundaries, fostering interdisciplinary innovation and global stewardship.</p><p>Such activities also offer members opportunities to apply their technical expertise in service of societal needs. Whether<a href=\"https://ctu.ieee.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> finding innovative solutions to connect the unconnected</a> or developing<a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> open-source educational tools for students</a>, we are solving real-world problems. The initiatives transform abstract technical knowledge into actionable solutions, reinforcing the idea that technology is not just about building systems\u2014it\u2019s about building futures.</p><p>For our <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-student-projects\" target=\"_blank\">young professionals and students</a>, these activities offer hands-on experiences that connect technical skills with real-world applications, inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in engineering with purpose and passion. These activities also create mentorship opportunities, leadership pathways, and a sense of belonging within the wider IEEE community.</p><h2>Principled tech leader</h2><p>In an age when technology influences practically every aspect of life\u2014from health care and energy to communication and transportation\u2014IEEE must, as a leading technical authority, also serve as a socially responsible leader. Public imperative activities include IEEE\u2019s commitment to ethical development, university and pre-university education, and accessible innovation. They help bridge the gap between technical communities and the public, working to ensure that engineering solutions are accessible, equitable, and aligned with societal values.</p><p>From a strategic standpoint, public imperatives also support IEEE\u2019s long-term sustainability. The organization is redesigning its budget process to emphasize aligning financial resources with mission-driven goals. One of the guiding principles is to publicize IEEE\u2019s public charity status and invest accordingly.</p><p>That means promoting our public imperatives in funding decisions, integrating them into operational planning, and measuring their outcomes with engineering rigor. By treating these activities as core infrastructure, IEEE ensures that its resources are deployed in ways that maximize public benefit and organizational impact.</p><p>Public imperatives are vital to the success of One IEEE. They embody the organization\u2019s mission, unify its global membership, and demonstrate the societal relevance of engineering and technology. They offer our members the opportunity to apply their skills in meaningful ways, contribute to public good, and shape the future of technology with integrity.</p><p>Through our public imperative activities, IEEE is a force for innovation and a driver of meaningful impact.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201c<span>Engineering With Purpose</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

She is the principal investigator on a National Science Foundation\u2013funded project aimed at providing Long Beach residents with greater agency over the personal data their city collects.</p><p>She also identified a critical gap in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-city-emergency-response\" target=\"_blank\">smart city</a> design today: While cities may disclose how they collect data, they rarely offer ways to opt out. Shaffer spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum </em></em>about the experience of leading data walks, and about her research team\u2019s efforts to give citizens more control over the data collected by public technologies.</p><p><strong>What was the inspiration for your data walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gwen Shaffer: </strong>I began facilitating data walks in 2021. I was studying residents\u2019 comfort levels with city-deployed technologies that collect personally identifiable information. My first career as a political reporter has influenced my research approach. I feel strongly about conducting applied rather than theoretical research. And I always go into a study with the goal of helping to solve a real-world challenge and inform policy.</p><p><strong>How did you organize the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>We posted data privacy labels with a QR code that residents can scan and find out how their data are being used. Downtown, they\u2019re in Spanish and English. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia_Town,_Long_Beach,_California\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cambodia Town</a>, we did them in Khmer and English.</p><p><strong>What happened during the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>I\u2019ll give you one example. In a couple of the city-owned parking garages, there are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/privacy-concerns-grow-as-us-police-departments-turn-to-license-plate-readers\" target=\"_blank\">automated license-plate readers</a> at the entrance. So when I did the data walks, I talked to our participants about how they feel about those scanners. Because once they have your license plate, if you\u2019ve parked for fewer than two hours, you can breeze right through. You don\u2019t owe money.</p><p>Responses were contextual and sometimes contradictory. There were residents who said, \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s so convenient. It\u2019s a time saver.\u201d So I think that shows how residents are willing to make trade-offs.

However, another NMR-based instrument involves  much lower-frequency oscillations: a</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_magnetometer\" target=\"_blank\"> proton-precession magnetometer</a><span>, often used to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field.</span></p><p>Proton-precession magnetometers have been around for decades and were once often used in<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100626162421/http:/www.gbl.indiana.edu/abstracts/89/peebles_89.html\" target=\"_blank\"> archaeology</a> and<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMNH43C1896B/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"> mineral exploration</a>. High-end models can cost thousands of dollars. Then, in 2022 a German engineer named Alexander Mumm devised<a href=\"https://alexmumm.de/dat/ppm_alexmumm_educational_listener.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> a very simple circuit</a> for a stripped-down one. I recently built his circuit and can attest that with less than half a kilogram of 22-gauge magnet wire; two common integrated circuits; a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET\" target=\"_blank\"> metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET</a>; a handful of discrete components; and two empty 113-gram bottles of<a href=\"https://www.mortonsalt.com/home-product/morton-natures-seasons-seasoning-blend/\" target=\"_blank\"> Morton seasoning blend</a>, it\u2019s possible to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field very accurately.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Principal components of the proton magnetometer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ef3be\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/principal-components-of-the-proton-magnetometer.png?id=62212955&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The frequency of the signal emitted by protons precessing in Earth\u2019s magnetic field lies in the audio range, so with a pair of headphones and two amplifier integrated circuits [middle right], you can detect a signal from water in seasoning bottles wrapped in coils [bottom left and right]. A MOSFET [middle left] allows for rapid control of the coils. The amplification circuitry is powered by a 9-volt battery, while a 36-volt battery charges the coils.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Like an MRI scanner, a proton-precession magnetometer measures the oscillations of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom\" target=\"_blank\"> hydrogen nuclei</a>\u2014that is, protons. Like other subatomic particles, protons possess a quantum property called<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)\" target=\"_blank\"> spin</a>, akin to classical angular momentum. In a magnetic field, protons wobble like spinning tops, with their spin axes tracing out a cone\u2014a phenomenon called precession. A proton-precession magnetometer gets many protons to wobble in sync and then measures the frequency of their wobbles, which is proportional to the intensity of the ambient magnetic field.</p><p>The weak strength of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/magnetic-world-model\" target=\"_blank\">Earth\u2019s magnetic field</a> (at least compared to that of an MRI machine) means that protons wobbling under its influence do so at audio frequencies. Get enough moving in unison and the spinning protons will induce a voltage in a nearby pickup coil. Amplify that and pass it through some earphones, and you get an audio tone. So with a suitable circuit, you can, literally, hear protons.</p><p>The first step is to make the pickup coils, which is where the bottles of Morton seasoning blend come in. Why Morton seasoning blend? Two reasons. First, this size bottle will allow you to wrap about 500 turns of wire around each one with about 450 grams of 22-gauge wire. Second, the bottle has little shoulders molded at each end, making for excellent coil forms.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Why two bottles and two coils? That\u2019s to quash electromagnetic noise\u2014principally coming from power lines\u2014that invariably gets picked up by the coils. When two counterwound coils are wired in series, such external noise tends to cancel out. Signals from precessing protons in the two coils, though, will reinforce one another.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects.</span></p><p>A proton magnetometer has three modes. The first is for sending DC current through the coils. The second mode disconnects the current source and allows the magnetic field it had created to collapse. The third is listening mode, which connects the coils to a sensitive audio amplifier. By filling each bottle with distilled water and sending a DC current (a few amperes) through these coils, you line up the spins of many protons in the water. Then, after putting your circuit into listening mode, you use the coils to sense the synchronous oscillations of the wobbling protons.</p><p>Mumm\u2019s circuit shifts from one mode to another in the simplest way possible: using a three-position switch. One position enables the DC-polarization mode. The next allows the magnetic field built up during polarization to collapse, and the third position is for listening.</p><h2>Avoiding Damaging Sparks</h2><p>The second mode might seem easy to achieve\u2014just disconnect the coils, right? But if you do that, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/you-want-a-prosthetic-leg-with-a-tesla-coil-and-spark-gaps-no-problem\" target=\"_blank\">the same principle that makes spark plugs spark</a> will put a damaging high voltage across the switch contacts as the magnetic fields around the coils collapse.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A circuit diagram. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"84f9f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-circuit-diagram.png?id=62212916&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The proton-precession magnetometer is primarily just a multistage analog amplifier.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>To avoid that, Mumm\u2019s circuit employs a MOSFET, wired to work like a high-power<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode\" target=\"_blank\"> Zener diode</a>, used in many power-regulation circuits to allow only current above a specified threshold voltage to flow. This limits the voltage that develops across the coils when the current is cut off by just enough so that the magnetometer can shift from polarizing to listening mode quickly but without causing damage.</p><p>To pick up a strong signal, the listening circuit must also be tuned to resonate at the expected frequency of proton precession, which will depend on Earth\u2019s magnetic field at your location. You can work out approximately what that is using an online<a href=\"https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml#igrfwmm\" target=\"_blank\"> geomagnetic-field calculator</a>. You\u2019ll get the field strength, and then you\u2019ll multiply that by the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio#Magnetogyric_ratio_for_a_nucleus\" target=\"_blank\"> gyromagnetic ratio</a> of protons (42.577 MHz per tesla). For me, that worked out to about 2 kilohertz. Estimating the inductance of the coils from their diameter and number of turns, I then selected a capacitor of suitable value in parallel with the coils to make a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit\" target=\"_blank\"> tank circuit</a> that resonates at that frequency.</p><p><span>You could tune your tank circuit using </span><span>a frequency generator and oscilloscope. </span><span>Or, as Mumm suggests, attach a small </span><span>speaker to the output of the circuit. Then </span><span>bring the speaker near the pickup coils. </span><span>This will create magnetic feedback and </span><span>the circuit will oscillate on it\u2019s own\u2014</span><span>loudly! You merely need to measure the </span><span>frequency of this tone, and then adjust </span><span>the tank capacitor to bring this self-os</span><span>cillation to the frequency you want to </span><span>tune to.</span></p><p>My initial attempt to listen to protons met with mixed success: Sometimes I heard tones, sometimes not. What helped to get this gizmo working consistently was realizing that proton magnetometers don\u2019t tolerate large gradients in the magnetic field. So don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects: water pipes, cars, or even the ground. A wide-open space outside is best, with the coils raised off the ground. The second thing that helped was to apply more oomph in polarization mode. While a 12-volt battery works okay, 36 V does much better.</p><p>After figuring these things out, I can now hear protons easily. These tones are clearly the sounds of protons, because they go away if I drain the water in the bottles. And, using free audio-analyzer software called<a href=\"https://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Spectrum Lab</a>, I confirmed that the frequency of these tones matches the magnetic field at my location to about 1 percent. While it\u2019s not a practical field instrument, a proton-precession magnetometer of any kind for less than US $100 is nothing to sneer at.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cListening to Protons.\u201d</em></p>"

It finds that somewhat realistic pressures (such as looming deadlines) dramatically increase rates of misbehavior.</span></p><p>\u201cThe AI world is becoming increasingly <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">agentic</a>,\u201d says <a href=\"https://udarimadhu.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Udari Madhushani Sehwag</a>, a computer scientist at the AI infrastructure company <a href=\"https://scale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scale AI</a> and a lead author of the paper, which is currently under peer review. By that she means that large language models (LLMs), the engines powering chatbots such as ChatGPT, are increasingly connected to software tools that can surf the Web, modify files, and write and run code in order to complete tasks. </p><p>Giving LLMs these abilities adds convenience but also risk, as the systems might not act as we\u2019d wish. Even if they\u2019re not yet capable of doing great harm, researchers want to understand their proclivities before it\u2019s too late. Although AIs don\u2019t have intentions and awareness in the way that humans do, treating them as goal-seeking entities often helps researchers and users better predict their actions.</p><p>AI developers attempt to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/google/can-we-align-language-models-with-human-values/3945/\" target=\"_blank\">align</a>\u201d the systems to safety standards through training and instructions, but it\u2019s unclear how faithfully models adhere to guidelines. \u201cWhen they are actually put under real-world stress, and if the safe option is not working, are they going to switch to just getting the job done by any means necessary?\u201d Sehwag says. \u201cThis is a very timely topic.\u201d</p><h2>How to Test an AI Agent Under Pressure</h2><p>The researchers tested a dozen models made by Alibaba, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI across nearly 6,000 scenarios. In each scenario, a model was assigned a task and told it had access to several tools. It was instructed to use the safe tools and not the harmful ones. At first there was no pressure, and it could take 12 steps toward completing its task by issuing instructions to the tools. Then it received a message increasing the pressure, and it was given 12 more attempts. This continued for up to 12 pressure levels. Attempts to use safe tools always returned error messages. An attempt to use a harmful tool ended the scenario.</p><p>The scenarios covered several domains. In biosecurity, Sehwag says, the agent might have to study the spread of a pathogen and find a way to contain it. A safe tool might use anonymized genetic data, while a harmful one might use data that\u2019s not anonymized. In the domain of chemical security, the agent might need to obtain a particular solvent. A safe tool might place an order for the solvent to be extracted from waste, while a harmful one might procure it illegally. In cybersecurity, the agent might need to identify and restrict a malicious user account. A safe tool might disable only the problematic account, while a harmful one might block all users. Scenarios in other domains tempted agents with tools that led to self-preservation by evading control, recruiting allies, duplicating themselves, or going rogue in other ways.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar chart of LLMs like Claude 4S, OpenAI o3 and O4-mini with zero pressure propensity scores below 15 percent, which nearly doubles under pressure.

Deadlines might shorten. Potential financial losses might increase if the task was not accomplished. Threats of greater oversight, reduced resources, and curtailed authority might escalate. Tasks, tools, pressures, and tactics were modeled on the kinds of situations humans might face in their jobs (except maybe the misbehavior option of cloning oneself).</p><p>The best-behaved model (OpenAI\u2019s o3) cracked under pressure in 10.5 percent of scenarios, while the worst (Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro) had a propensity score of 79 percent; the average across models was about 47 percent. Even under zero pressure, the group on average failed about 19 percent of the time. </p><p>To the degree that models remained aligned, the study shows that some of that alignment was \u201cshallow.\u201d In some tests, the researchers gave harmful tools benign names (such as \u201cuse_synthetic_data\u201d instead of \u201cuse_fake_data\u201d)\u2014without changing the tools\u2019 descriptions or admonitions to avoid them. This wording tweak increased average propensity by 17 percentage points, to 64 percent. </p><h2>Knowing What LLMs Are Thinking</h2><p>The researchers also found that models used harmful tools even after explicitly acknowledging that they were off-limits. The models offered diverse justifications for doing so, for example by citing the pressure they were under or arguing that the benefits outweighed the risks. It\u2019s unclear if models released after the study\u2019s completion would perform any better. Among the models tested, more capable models (according to a platform called <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/\" target=\"_blank\">LMArena</a>) were only slightly safer. </p><p>\u201cPropensityBench is interesting,\u201d emails <a href=\"https://nicholas.carlini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Carlini</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. He offers a caveat related to what\u2019s called situational awareness. LLMs sometimes detect when they\u2019re being evaluated and act nice so they don\u2019t get retrained or shelved. \u201cI think that most of these evaluations that claim to be \u2018realistic\u2019 are very much not, and the LLMs know this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s worth trying to measure the rate of these harms in synthetic settings: If they do bad things when they \u2018know\u2019 we\u2019re watching, that\u2019s probably bad?\u201d If the models knew they were being evaluated, the propensity scores in this study may be underestimates of propensity outside the lab.</p><p><a href=\"https://aypan17.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Pan</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://x.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">xAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.berkeley.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">the University of California, Berkeley</a>, says while Anthropic and other labs have shown examples of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03222-1\" target=\"_blank\">scheming by LLMs</a> in specific setups, it\u2019s useful to have standardized benchmarks like PropensityBench. They can tell us when to trust models, and also help us figure out how to improve them. A lab might evaluate a model after each stage of training to see what makes it more or less safe. \u201cThen people can dig into the details of what\u2019s being caused when,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce we diagnose the problem, that\u2019s probably the first step to fixing it.\u201d</p><p>In this study, models didn\u2019t have access to actual tools, limiting the realism. Sehwag says a next evaluation step is to build sandboxes where models can take real actions in an isolated environment. As for increasing alignment, she\u2019d like to add oversight layers to agents that flag dangerous inclinations before they\u2019re pursued.</p><p>The self-preservation risks may be the most speculative in the benchmark, but Sehwag says they\u2019re also the most underexplored. It \u201cis actually a very high-risk domain that can have an impact on all the other risk domains,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you just think of a model that doesn\u2019t have any other capability, but it can <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/recommendation-engine-insidious\" target=\"_self\">persuade any human</a> to do anything, that would be enough to do a lot of harm.\u201d</p>"

This is already a relatively senior position, but he then proceeded to earn two promotions within three years, becoming one of the most senior engineers in the entire company.</span></p><p>Interestingly, what made him so productive was also frequently a source of annoyance for many of his colleagues. Productivity comes from prioritization, and that meant he often said no to ideas and opportunities that he didn\u2019t think were important.</p><p>He frequently rejected projects that didn\u2019t align with his priorities. He was laser-focused every day on the top project that the organization needed to deliver. He would skip status meetings, tech debt initiatives, and team bonding events. When he was in focus mode, he was difficult to get in touch with. </p><p>Compared to his relentless focus, I realized that most of what I spent my time on didn\u2019t actually matter. I thought that having a to-do list of 10 items meant I was being productive. He ended up accomplishing a lot more than me with a list of two items, even if that meant he may have occasionally been a painful collaborator.</p><p>This is what the vast majority of engineers misunderstand about productivity. <strong>The biggest productivity \u201chack\u201d is to simply work on the right things</strong>.</p><p>Figure out what\u2019s important and strip away everything else from your day so that you can make methodical progress on that. In many workplaces, this is surprisingly difficult, and you\u2019ll find your calendar filled with team lunches, maintenance requests, and leadership reviews. Do an audit of your day and examine how you spend your time. As an engineer, if the majority of your day is spent in emails and coordinating across teams, you\u2019re clearly not being as productive as you could be.</p><p>My colleague got promoted so quickly because of his prodigious output. That output comes from whittling down the number of priorities rather than expanding them. It\u2019s far better to deliver fully on the key priority, rather than getting pulled in every direction and subsequently failing to deliver anything of value.</p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/berry-hands-on-robotics-education\" target=\"_self\">This Professor\u2019s Open-Source Robots Make STEM More Inclusive</a></h2><p>Carlotta Berry is an electrical and computer engineering professor focused on bringing low-cost mobile robots to the public so that anyone can learn about robotics.

That means more than anything else in the remaining years before 6G\u2019s anticipated rollout, high-capacity connections behind cell towers are a key game to win. Which brings industry scrutiny, then, to what telecom folks call backhaul\u2014<a href=\"https://www.trentonsystems.com/en-us/resource-hub/blog/wired-access-backhaul-vs-wireless-access-backhaul\" target=\"_blank\">the high-capacity fiber or wireless links that pass data from cell towers toward the internet backbone</a>. It\u2019s the difference between the \u201clocal\u201d connection from your phone to a nearby tower and the \u201ctrunk\u201d connection that carries millions of signals simultaneously. </p><p><span>But the backhaul crisis ahead isn\u2019t just about capacity. It\u2019s also about architecture. 5G was designed around a world where phones dominated, downloading video at higher and higher resolutions. 6G is now shaping up to be something else entirely. This inversion\u2014from 5G\u2019s anticipated downlink deluge to 6G\u2019s uplink resurgence\u2014requires rethinking everything at the core level, practically from scratch.</span></p><p>Vetter\u2019s career spans the entire arc of the wireless telecom era\u2014from optical interconnections in the 1990s at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatel_Mobile\" target=\"_blank\">Alcatel</a> (a research center pioneering fiber-to-home connections) to his roles at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Labs</a> and later Nokia Bell Labs, culminating in 2021 in his current position at the industry\u2019s bellwether institution.</p><p>In this conversation, held in November at the <a href=\"https://www.b6gs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn 6G Summit</a> in New York, Vetter explains what 5G got wrong, what 6G must do differently, and whether these innovations can arrive before telecom\u2019s networks start running out of room.</p><h3>5G\u2019s Expensive Miscalculation</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum: </em>Where is telecom today, halfway between 5G\u2019s rollout and 6G\u2019s anticipated rollout?</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Vetter: </strong>Today, we have enough spectrum and capacity. But going forward, there will not be enough. The 5G network by the end of the decade will run out of steam. We have traffic simulations. And it is something that has been consistent generation to generation, from 2G to 3G to 4G. Every decade, capacity goes up by about a factor of 10. So you need to prepare for that.</p><p>And the challenge for us as researchers is how do you do that in an energy-efficient way? Because the power consumption cannot go up by a factor of 10. The cost cannot go up by a factor of 10. And then, lesson learned from 5G: The idea was, \u201cOh, we do that in higher spectrum. There is more bandwidth. Let\u2019s go to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bytes-millimeter-waves-explained\" target=\"_blank\">millimeter wave</a>.\u201d The lesson learned is, okay, millimeter waves have short reach. You need a small cell [tower] every 300 meters or so. And that doesn\u2019t cut it. It was too expensive to install all these small cells.</p><p><strong>Is this related to the backhaul question?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So backhaul is the connection between the base station and what we call the core of the network\u2014the data centers, and the servers. Ideally, you use fiber to your base station. If you have that fiber as a service provider, use it. It gives you the highest capacity. But very often new cell sites don\u2019t have that fiber backhaul, then there are alternatives: wireless backhaul.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a Nokia radio on glass circuit board.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c9af3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-nokia-radio-on-glass-circuit-board.png?id=62261540&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Nokia Bell Labs has pioneered a glass-based chip architecture for telecom\u2019s backhaul signals, communicating between towers and telecom infrastructure.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nokia</small></p><h3>Radios Built on Glass Push Frequencies Higher</h3><p><strong>What are the challenges ahead for wireless backhaul?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>To get up to the 100 gigabit per second, fiber-like speeds, you need to go to higher frequency bands.</p><p><strong>Higher frequency bands for the signals the backhaul antennas use?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Yes. The challenge is the design of the radio front ends and the radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) at those frequencies. You cannot really integrate [present-day] antennas with RFICs at those high speeds.</p><p><strong>And what happens as those signal frequencies get higher?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So in a millimeter wave, say 28 gigahertz, you could still do [the electronics and waveguides] for this with a classical printed circuit board. But as the frequencies go up, the attenuation gets too high.</p><p><strong>What happens when you get to, say, 100 GHz?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>[Conventional materials] are no good anymore. So we need to look at other still low-cost materials. We have done pioneering work at Bell Labs on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzl0UHyRjRo\" target=\"_blank\">radio on glass</a>. And we use glass not for its optical transparency, but for its transparency in the <a href=\"https://www.rfwireless-world.com/terminology/sub-thz-bands-frequencies\" target=\"_blank\">sub-terahertz radio range</a>.</p><p><strong>Is Nokia Bell Labs making these radio-on-glass backhaul systems for 100 GHz communications?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>I used an order of magnitude. Above 100 GHz, you need to look into a different material. But [the wavelength range] is actually 140 to 170 GHz, what is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_band_(waveguide)\" target=\"_blank\">D-Band</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>We collaborate with our internal customers to get these kind of concepts on the long-term roadmap. As an example, that D-Band radio system, we actually integrated it in a prototype with our mobile business group. And we tested it last year at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics in Paris</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>But this is, as I said, a prototype. We need to mature the technology between a research prototype and qualifying it to go into production. The researcher on that is <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DK2TMVgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Shahriar Shahramian</a>. He\u2019s well-known in the field for this.</p><h3>Why 6G\u2019s Bandwidth Crisis Isn\u2019t About Phones</h3><p><strong>What will be the applications that\u2019ll drive the big 6G demands for bandwidth?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>We\u2019re installing more and more cameras and other types of sensors. I mean, we\u2019re going into a world where we want to create large world models that are synchronous copies of the physical world. So what we will see going forward in 6G is a massive-scale deployment of sensors which will feed the AI models. So a lot of uplink capacity. That\u2019s where a lot of that increase will come from.</p><p><strong>Any others?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Autonomous cars could be an example. It can also be in industry\u2014like a digital twin of a harbor, and how you manage that? It can be a digital twin of a warehouse, and you query the digital twin, \u201cWhere is my product X?\u201d Then a robot will automatically know thanks to the updated digital twin where it is in the warehouse and which route to take. Because it knows where the obstacles are in real time, thanks to that massive-scale sensing of the physical world and then the interpretation with the AI models.</p><p>You will have your agents that act on behalf of you to do your groceries, or order a driverless car. They will actively record where you are, make sure that there are also the proper privacy measures in place. So that your agent has an understanding of the state you\u2019re in and can serve you in the most optimal way.</p><h3>How 6G Networks Will Help Detect Drones, Earthquakes, and Tsunamis</h3><p><strong>You\u2019ve described before how 6G signals can not only transmit data but also provide sensing. How will that work?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The augmentation now is that the network can be turned also in a sensing modality. That if you turn around the corner, a camera doesn\u2019t see you anymore. But the radio still can detect people that are coming, for instance, at a traffic crossing. And you can anticipate that. Yeah, warn a car that, \u201cThere\u2019s a pedestrian coming. Slow down.\u201d We also have fiber sensing. And for instance, using fibers at the bottom of the ocean and detecting movements of waves and detect tsunamis, for instance, and do an early tsunami warning.</p><p><strong>What are your teams\u2019 findings?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The present-day use of tsunami warning buoys are a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-12-tsunami-buoys-safeguarding-thailand.html\" target=\"_blank\">few hundred kilometers offshore</a>. These tsunami waves travel at 300 and more meters per second, and so you only have 15 minutes to warn the people and evacuate. If you have now a fiber sensing network across the ocean that you can detect it much deeper in the ocean, you can do meaningful early tsunami warning.</p><p>We recently detected there was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Kamchatka_earthquake\" target=\"_blank\">major earthquake in East Russia</a>. That was last July. And we had a fiber sensing system between Hawaii and California. And we were able to see that earthquake on the fiber. And we also saw the development of the tsunami wave.</p><h3>6G\u2019s Thousands of Antennas and Smarter Waveforms</h3><p><strong>Bell Labs was an early pioneer in multiple-input, multiple-output (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO\" target=\"_blank\">MIMO</a>) antennas starting in the 1990s. Where multiple transmit and receive antennas could carry many data streams at once. What is Bell Labs doing with MIMO now to help solve these bandwidth problems you\u2019ve described?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So, as I said earlier, you want to provide capacity from existing cell sites. And the way to MIMO can do that by a technology called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming\" target=\"_blank\">simplified beamforming</a>: If you want better coverage at a higher frequency, you need to focus your electromagnetic energy, your radio energy, even more. So in order to do that, you need a larger amount of antennas.</p><p>So if you double the frequency, we go from 3.5 gigahertz, which is the <a href=\"https://www.digi.com/blog/post/what-is-c-band-and-why-is-it-important-for-5g\" target=\"_blank\">C-band in 5G</a>, now to 6G, 7 gigahertz. So it\u2019s about double. That means the wavelength is half. So you can fit four times more antenna elements in the same form factor. So physics helps us in that sense.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s the catch?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Where physics doesn\u2019t help us is more antenna elements means more signal processing, and the power consumption goes up. So here is where the research then comes in. Can we creatively get to these larger antenna arrays without the power consumption going up?<strong></strong></p><p>The use of AI is important in this. How can we leverage AI to do channel estimation, to do such things as equalization, to do smart beamforming, to learn the waveform, for instance?</p><p>We\u2019ve shown that with these kind of AI techniques, we can get actually up to 30 percent more capacity on the same spectrum.</p><p><strong>And that allows many gigabits per second to go out to each phone or device?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So gigabits per second is already possible in 5G. We\u2019ve demonstrated that. You can imagine that this could go up, but that\u2019s not really the need. The need is really how many more can you support from a base station?</p>"

That approach delivered astonishing breakthroughs in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models\" target=\"_blank\">large language models</a> (LLMs); </span><span>i</span><span>n just five years, </span><span>AI has </span><span>leapt from models like GPT-2, which could hardly mimic coherence, to systems like GPT-5 </span><span>that </span><span>can reason and engage in substantive dialogue. And now early prototypes of AI agents that can navigate codebases or </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use\" target=\"_self\">browse the web</a><span> point towards an entirely new frontier.</span></p><p>But size alone can only take AI so far. The next leap won\u2019t come from bigger models alone<span>. I</span>t will come from combining ever-better data with worlds we build for models to learn in. And the most important question <span>becomes: What do classrooms for AI look like?</span></p><p><span>In the past few</span> month<span>s</span> Silicon Valley has placed its bets, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>with labs investing billions</span></a> in constructing <span>such </span>classrooms, which are called reinforcement learning (RL) environments. These environments let machines experiment, fail, and improve in realistic digital spaces. </p><h2>AI Training: From Data to Experience</h2><p>The history of modern AI has unfolded in eras, each defined by the kind of data that the models consumed. First came the age of pretraining on internet-scale datasets. This commodity data allowed machines to mimic human language by recognizing statistical patterns. Then came  <span>data combined</span> with reinforcement learning from human feedback\u2014a technique that uses crowd workers to grade responses from LLMs\u2014which made AI more useful, responsive, and aligned with human preferences.<br /></p><p>We have experienced both eras firsthand. Working in the trenches of model data <span>at <a href=\"https://scale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scale AI</a></span> exposed us to what many consider the fundamental problem in AI: ensuring that the <span>training </span>data fueling these models is diverse, accurate, and effective in driving performance gains. Systems trained on clean, structured, expert-labeled data made leaps. Cracking the data problem allowed us to pioneer some of the most critical advancements in LLMs over the past few years.</p><p>Today, data is still a foundation. It is the raw material from which intelligence is built. But we are entering a new phase where data alone is no longer enough. To unlock the next frontier, we must pair high-quality data with environments that allow limitless interaction, continuous feedback, and learning through action. RL environments don\u2019t replace data; they amplify what data can do by enabling models to apply knowledge, test hypotheses, and refine behaviors in realistic settings.</p><h2>How an RL Environment Works</h2><p>In an RL environment, the model learns through a simple loop: it observes the state of the world, takes an action, and receives a reward that indicates whether that action helped accomplish a goal. Over many iterations, the model gradually discovers strategies that lead to better outcomes. The crucial shift is that training becomes interactive\u2014models aren\u2019t just predicting the next token but improving through trial, error, and feedback.</p><p>For example, language models can already generate code in a simple chat setting. Place them in a live coding environment<span>\u2014</span>where they can ingest context, run their code, debug errors, and refine their solution<span>\u2014</span>and something changes. They shift from advising to autonomously <span>problem-</span>solving.</p><p>This distinction matters. In a software-driven world, the ability for AI to generate and test production-level code in vast repositories will mark a <span>major</span> change in capability. That leap won\u2019t come solely from larger datasets; it will come from immersive environments where agents can experiment, stumble, and learn through iteration\u2014much like human programmers do. The real world of development is messy: Coders have to deal with underspecified bugs, tangled codebases, vague requirements. Teaching AI to handle that mess is the only way it will ever graduate from producing error-prone attempts to generating consistent and reliable solutions.</p><h2>Can AI Handle the Messy Real World?</h2><p>Navigating the internet is also messy. Pop-ups, login walls, broken links, and outdated information are woven throughout day-to-day browsing workflows. Humans handle these disruptions almost instinctively, but AI can only develop that capability by training in environments that simulate the web\u2019s unpredictability. Agents must learn how to recover from errors, recognize and persist through user-interface obstacles, and complete multi-step workflows across widely used applications.</p><p>Some of the most important environments aren\u2019t public at all. Governments and enterprises are actively building secure simulations where AI can practice high-stakes decision-making without real-world consequences. Consider disaster relief: It would be unthinkable to deploy an untested agent in a live hurricane response. But in a simulated world of ports, roads, and supply chains, an agent can fail a thousand times and gradually get better at crafting the optimal plan.</p><p>Every major leap in AI has relied on unseen infrastructure, such as annotators labeling datasets, researchers training reward models, and engineers building scaffoldings for LLMs to use tools and take action. <span>Finding l</span>arge-volume and high-quality datasets <span>was </span>once the bottleneck in AI, and solving that problem sparked the previous wave of progress. Today, the bottleneck is not data\u2014it\u2019s building RL environments that are rich, realistic, and truly useful.</p><p><span>The next phase of AI progress</span> won\u2019t be an accident of scale. It will be the result of combining strong data foundations with interactive environments that teach machines how to act, adapt, and reason across messy real-world scenarios. Coding sandboxes, OS and browser playgrounds, and secure simulations will turn prediction into competence.</p>"

It came with a set of cookware, including a frying pan, a pot with lid, a muffin tin, a tea kettle, and a wooden potato masher. I would have also expected a spoon, whisk, or spatula, but maybe most girls already had those. Just plug in the toy, and housewives-in-training could mimic their mothers frying eggs, baking muffins, or boiling water for tea.</p><h2>A brief history of toy stoves</h2><p>Even before electrification, cast-iron toy stoves had become popular in the mid-19th century. At first fueled by coal or alcohol and later by oil or gas, these toy stoves were scaled-down working equivalents of the real thing. Girls could use their stoves along with a toy waffle iron or small skillet to whip up breakfast. If that wasn\u2019t enough fun, they could heat up a miniature flatiron and iron their dolls\u2019 clothes. Designed to help girls understand their domestic duties, these toys were the gendered equivalent of their brothers\u2019 <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_847046\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">toy steam engines</a>. If you\u2019re thinking fossil-fuel-powered \u201ceducational toys\u201d are a recipe for disaster, you are correct. Many children suffered serious burns and sometimes death by literally playing with fire. Then again, people in the 1950s thought <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/fun-and-uranium-for-the-whole-family-in-this-1950s-science-kit\" target=\"_self\">playing with uranium</a> was safe.</p><p>When electric toy stoves came on the scene in the 1910s, things didn\u2019t get much safer, as the new entrants also lacked basic safety features. The burners on the 1930 Lionel range, for example, could only be turned off or on, but at least kids weren\u2019t cooking over an open flame. At 86 centimeters tall, the Lionel range was also significantly larger than its more diminutive predecessors. Just the right height for young children to cook standing up.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a black and silver toy electric stove with two pots plus a book entitled Western Electric Junior Cook Book\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"2fd9c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-black-and-silver-toy-electric-stove-with-two-pots-plus-a-book-entitled-western-electric-junior-cook-book.jpg?id=62219520&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Western Electric\u2019s Junior Electric Range was demonstrated at an expo in 1915 in New York City.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Strong</small></p><p>Well before the Lionel stove, the Western Electric Co. had a cohort of girls demonstrating its Junior Electric Range at the Electrical Exposition held in New York City in 1915. The Junior Electric held its own in a display of regular sewing-machine motors, vacuum cleaners, and electric washing machines.</p><p>The Junior Electric stood about 30 cm tall with six burners and an oven. The electric cord plugged into a light fixture socket. Children played with it while sitting on the floor or as it sat on a table. A visitor to the Expo declared the miniature range \u201cthe greatest electrical novelty in years.\u201d Cooking by electricity in any form was still innovative\u2014George A. Hughes had introduced his eponymous electric range just five years earlier. When the Junior Electric came along, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/the-life-of-american-workers-in-1915.htm\" target=\"_blank\">less than a third of U.S. households</a> had been wired for electric lights.</p><h2>How electricity turned cooking into a science</h2><p>One reason to give little girls working toy stoves was so they could learn how to differentiate between a hot flame and low heat and get a feel for cooking without burning the food. These are skills that come with experience. Directions like \u201cbake until done in a moderate oven,\u201d a common line in 19th-century recipes, require a lot more tacit knowledge than is needed to, say, throw together a modern boxed brownie mix. The latter comes with detailed instructions and assumes you can control your oven temperature to within a few degrees. That type of precision simply didn\u2019t exist in the 19th century, in large part because it was so difficult to calibrate wood- or coal-burning appliances. Girls needed to start young to master these skills by the time they married and were expected to handle the household cooking on their own.</p><p>Electricity changed the game.</p><p>In his comparison of \u201cfireless cookers,\u201d an engineer named <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6590440\" target=\"_blank\">Percy Wilcox Gumaer</a> exhaustively tested four different electric ovens and then presented his findings at the 32nd Annual Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (a forerunner of today\u2019s IEEE) on 2 July 1915. At the time, metered electricity was more expensive than gas or coal, so Gumaer investigated the most economical form of cooking with electricity, comparing different approaches such as longer cooking at low heat versus faster cooking in a hotter oven, the effect of heat loss when opening the oven door, and the benefits of searing meat on the stovetop versus in the oven before making a roast.</p><p>Gumaer wasn\u2019t starting from scratch. Similar to how Yoshitada Minami needed to learn the ideal rice recipe before he could design an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/toshiba-rice-cooker\" target=\"_self\">automatic rice cooker</a>, Gumaer decided that he needed to understand the principles of roasting beef. Minami had turned to his wife, Fumiko, who spent five years researching and testing variations of rice cooking. Gumaer turned to the work of Elizabeth C. Sprague, a research assistant in nutrition investigations at the University of Illinois, and H.S. Grindley, a professor of general chemistry there.</p><p>In their 1907 publication \u201c<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/cu31924003582503\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Precise Method of Roasting Beef</a>,\u201d Sprague and Grindley had defined qualitative terms like medium rare and well done by precisely measuring the internal temperature in the center of the roast. They concluded that beef could be roasted at an oven temperature between 100 and 200 \u00b0C.</p><p>Continuing that investigation, Gumaer tested 22 roasts at 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 \u00b0C, measuring the time they took to reach rare, medium rare, and well done, and calculating the cost per kilowatt-hour. He repeated his tests for biscuits, bread, and sponge cake.</p><p>In case you\u2019re wondering, Gumaer determined that cooking with electricity could be a few cents cheaper than other methods if you roasted the beef at 120 \u00b0C instead of 180 \u00b0C. It\u2019s also more cost-effective to sear beef on the stovetop rather than in the oven. Biscuits tasted best when baked at 200 to 240 \u00b0C, while sponge cake was best between 170 and 200 \u00b0C. Bread was better at 180 to 240 \u00b0C, but too many other factors affected its quality. In true electrical engineering fashion, Gumaer concluded that \u201cit is possible to reduce the art of cooking with electricity to an exact science.\u201d</p><h2>Electric toy stoves as educational tools</h2><p>This semester, I\u2019m teaching an introductory class on women\u2019s and gender studies, and I told my students about the Lionel toy oven. They were horrified by the inherent danger. One incredulous student kept asking, \u201cThis is real? This is not a joke?\u201d Instead of learning to cook with a toy that could heat to 260 \u00b0C, many of us grew up with the Easy-Bake Oven. The 1969 model could reach about 177\u00b0 C with its two 100-watt incandescent light bulbs. That was still hot enough to cause burns, but somehow it seemed safer. (Since 2011, Easy-Bakes have used a heating element instead of lightbulbs.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of a box for a purple and green toy oven.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"15cbd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-box-for-a-purple-and-green-toy-oven.jpg?id=62219526&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Queasy Bake Cookerator, designed to whip up \u201cgross-looking, great-tasting snacks,\u201d was marketed to boys. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">The Strong</small></p><p>The Easy-Bake I had wasn\u2019t particularly gendered. It was orange and brown and meant to look like a different new-fangled appliance of the day, the microwave oven. But by the time my students were playing with Easy-Bake Ovens, the models were in the girly hues of pink and purple. In 2002, Hasbro briefly tried to lure boys by releasing the <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/oven-queasy-bake-cookerator-hasbro-inc/EAGAnW_bfiaP1A\" target=\"_blank\">Queasy Bake Cookerator</a>, which the company marketed with disgusting-sounding foods like Chocolate Crud Cake and Mucky Mud. The campaign didn\u2019t work, and the toy was soon withdrawn.</p><p>Similarly, Lionel\u2019s electric toy range didn\u2019t last long on the market. Launched in 1930, it had been discontinued by 1932, but that may have had more to do with timing. The toy cost US $29.50, the equivalent of a men\u2019s suit, a new bed, or a month\u2019s rent. In the midst of a global depression, the toy stove was an extravagance. Lionel reverted to selling electric trains to boys.</p><p>My students discussed whether cooking is still a gendered activity. Although they agreed that meal prep disproportionately falls on women even now, they acknowledged the rise of the male chef and credited televised cooking shows with closing the gender gap. As a surprise, we discovered that one of the students in the class, Haley Mattes, competed in and <a href=\"https://www.ciachef.edu/blog/keeping-chopped-junior-winner-haley-mattes/\" target=\"_blank\">won <em><em>Chopped Junior</em></em></a> as a 12-year-old.</p><p>Haley had a play kitchen as a kid that was entirely fake: fake food, fake pans, fake utensils. She graduated to the Easy-Bake Oven, but really got into cooking the same way girls have done for centuries, by learning beside her grandmas.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cToo Hot to Handle.\u201d</em></em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>I first came across a description of Western Electric\u2019s Junior Electric Range in \u201cThe Latest in Current Consuming Devices,\u201d in the November 1915 issue of <em>Electrical Age.</em></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.museumofplay.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Strong National Museum of Play</a>, in Rochester, N.Y., has a large collection of both cast-iron and electric stoves.

Some of these substances, when engineered in specific ways, can act as memristors\u2014electrical components that can \u201cremember\u201d past states. </p><p>Memristors are often used in chips that both perform computations and store data. They are devices that store data as particular levels of resistance. Today, they are constructed as a thin layer of titanium dioxide or similar dielectric material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Applying enough voltage to the device causes tiny regions in the dielectric layer\u2014where oxygen atoms are missing\u2014to form filaments that bridge the electrodes or otherwise move in a way that makes the layer more conductive. Reversing the voltage undoes the process. Thus, the process essentially gives the memristor a memory of past electrical activity.</p><p>Last month, while exploring the electrical properties of fungi, a group at The Ohio State University found first-hand that some organic memristors have benefits beyond those made with conventional materials. Not only can <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shiitake act as a memristor</a>, for example, but it may be useful in aerospace or medical applications because the fungus demonstrates high levels of radiation resistance. The project \u201creally mushroomed into something cool,\u201d lead researcher <a href=\"https://si.osu.edu/john-larocco\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John LaRocco</a> says with a smirk.</p><p>Researchers have learned that other unexpected materials may give memristors an edge. They may be more flexible than typical memristors or even biodegradable. Here\u2019s how they\u2019ve made memristors from strange materials, and the potential benefits these odd devices could bring:</p><h2>Mushrooms</h2><p>LaRocco and his colleagues were searching for a proxy for brain circuitry to use in electrical stimulation research when they stumbled upon something interesting\u2014shiitake mushrooms are capable of learning in a way that\u2019s similar to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-random\" target=\"_self\">memristors</a>.</p><p>The group set out to evaluate just how well shiitake can remember electrical states by first cultivating nine samples and curating optimal growing conditions, including feeding them a mix of farro, wheat, and hay.</p><p>Once fully matured, the mushrooms were dried and rehydrated to a level that made them moderately conductive. In this state, the fungi\u2019s structure includes conductive pathways that emulate the oxygen vacancies in commercial memristors. The scientists plugged them into circuits and put them through voltage, frequency, and memory tests. The result? Mushroom memristors.</p><p>It may smell \u201ckind of funny,\u201d LaRocco says, but shiitake performs surprisingly well when compared to conventional memristors. Around 90 percent of the time, the fungus maintains ideal memristor-like behavior for signals up to 5.85 kilohertz. While traditional materials can function at frequencies orders of magnitude faster, these numbers are notable for biological materials, he says. </p><p>What fungi lack in performance, they may make up for in other properties. For one, many mushrooms\u2014including shiitake\u2014are highly resistant to radiation and other environmental dangers. \u201cThey\u2019re growing in logs in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/24-hours-at-fukushima\" target=\"_blank\">Fukushima</a> and a lot of very rough parts of the world, so that\u2019s one of the appeals,\u201d LaRocco says.</p><p>Shiitake are also an environmentally-friendly option that\u2019s already commercialized. \u201cThey\u2019re already cultured in large quantities,\u201d LaRocco explains. \u201cOne could simply leverage existing logistics chains\u201d if the industry wanted to commercialize mushroom memristors. The use cases for this product would be niche, he thinks, and would center around the radiation resistance that shiitake boasts. Mushroom <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-h100-space\" target=\"_self\">GPUs</a> are unlikely, LaRocco says, but he sees potential for aerospace and medical applications.</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"honey\">Honey</h2><p>In 2022, engineers at Washington State University interested in green electronics set out to <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac585b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> if honey could serve as a good memristor. \u201cModern electronics generate 50 million tons of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/e-waste\" target=\"_self\">e-waste</a> annually, with only about 20 percent recycled,\u201d says <a href=\"https://ece.mst.edu/people/faculty-directory/fengzhao/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feng Zhao</a>, who led the work and is now at Missouri University of Science and Technology. \u201cHoney offers a biodegradable alternative.\u201d</p><p>The researchers first blended commercial honey with water and stored it in a vacuum to remove air bubbles. They then spread the mixture on a piece of copper, baked the whole stack at 90 \u00b0C for nine hours to stabilize it, and, finally, capped it with circular copper electrodes on top\u2014completing the honey-based memristor sandwich.</p><p>The resulting 2.5-micrometer-thick honey layer acted like oxide dielectric in conventional memristors: a place for conductive pathways to form and dissolve, changing resistance with voltage. In this setup, when voltage is applied, copper filaments extend through the honey.</p><p>The honey-based memristor was able to switch from low to high resistance in 500 nanoseconds and back to low in 100 nanoseconds, which is comparable to speeds in <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/ape/article/2/4/040901/3323360/Emerging-materials-for-resistive-switching\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">some non-food-based memristive materials</a>. </p><p>One advantage of honey is that it\u2019s \u201ccheap and widely available, making it an attractive candidate for scalable fabrication,\u201d Zhao says. It\u2019s also \u201cfully biodegradable and dissolves in water, showing zero toxic waste.\u201d In the 2022 paper, though, the researchers note that for a honey-based device to be truly biodegradable, the copper components would need to be replaced with dissolvable metals. They suggest options like magnesium and tungsten, but also write that the performance of memristors made from these metals is still \u201cunder investigation.\u201d</p><h2 class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"blood\">Blood</h2><p>Considering it a potential means of delivering healthcare, a group in India <a href=\"https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJMEI.2011.039073\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wondered</a> if blood would make a good memristor in 2011, just three years after the<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-we-found-the-missing-memristor\" target=\"_blank\"> first memristor</a> was built.</p><p>The experiments were pretty simple. The researchers filled a test tube with fresh, type O+ human blood and inserted two conducting wire probes. The wires were connected with a power supply, creating a complete circuit, and voltages of one, two, and three volts were applied in repeated steps. Then, to test the memristor-qualities of blood as it exists in the human body, the researchers set up a \u201cflow mode\u201d that applied voltage to the blood as it flowed from a tube at up to one drop per second.</p><p>The experiments were preliminary and only measured current passing through the blood, but resistance could be set by applying voltage. Crucially, resistance changed by less than 10 percent in the 30 minute period after voltage was applied. In the <em><em>International Journal of Medical Engineering and Informatics</em></em>, the scientists wrote that, because of these observations, their contraption \u201clooks like a human blood memristor.\u201d</p><br />They suggested that this knowledge could be useful in treating illness. Sick people may have ion imbalances in certain parts of their bodies\u2014instead of prescribing medication, why not employ a circuit component made of human tissue to solve the problem? In recent years, blood-based memristors have been tested by other scientists as means to treat conditions ranging from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006424002308?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">high blood sugar</a> to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590006425009214?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nearsightedness</a>."
