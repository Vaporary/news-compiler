        "summary": "Is human-caused climate change likely to trigger enduring economic decline in modern societies? We study whether changes in violent conflict and economic growth caused by warming could interact to degrade economic opportunities and trap African countries in poverty. We provide evidence of an emerging high-conflict and low-growth \"poverty trap\" equilibrium in Africa and describe theoretically how such an equilibrium could result from warming. We then combine historical data on temperature, growth, and conflict with projections from a large ensemble of global climate models to evaluate the risk that warming and subsequent conflict could push African economies into a regime of sustained negative economic growth. We find that the risk of such \"economic collapse\" is material in a moderate-to-high emissions scenario. We estimate that in Africa, a current \"high\" emissions trajectory (RCP 7.0) may increase the incidence of conflict 5.1 percentage points (95% CI 0.2-13.0) and increase the share of countries with net negative GDP growth this century by 12.2 percentage points (95% CI 2.0-27.5).  We calculate that roughly 82% of this additional conflict risk and 14% of projected GDP losses are due to the interacting effects between these two outcomes, underscoring the importance of accounting for their indirect effects and feedbacks. Our findings suggest an unprecedented scale of emissions mitigation, economic policy innovation or institutional investment that would be required to contain the risk of catastrophic human impacts from climate change in many African countries."

        "summary": "Immunotherapy is a breakthrough innovation in cancer care but is also among the most expensive treatments, with costs exceeding $150,000 per patient. We study the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the most widely used class of immunotherapy drugs. In 2022, ICIs accounted for 44% of the $17.5 billion Medicare Part B cancer drug spending. We focus on metastatic melanoma, the first approved indication for ICIs. While overall cancer mortality rates declined since the 1990s, melanoma mortality rates increased through the early 2010s. Following the first ICI approvals in 2011 and 2014, melanoma mortality declined sharply. Using traditional Medicare claims, we estimate the impact of the introduction of ICIs on healthcare utilization, costs, and 1-year survival for patients with metastatic melanoma, relative to metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), where ICIs were not approved until 2017. Variation in approval timing allows us to isolate the effect of ICIs from broader cancer care trends. We find that ICIs reduced 1-year mortality by 6.2%. Since about 1 in 5 metastatic melanoma patients received ICIs, this implies a 27.5% reduction among treated patients. The introduction of ICIs also reduced chemotherapy and radiation use, but increased Medicare spending by 59.3% or about 260% among ICI-treated patients. Accounting for life expectancy gains beyond one year, the benefits of ICIs for melanoma patients appear comparable, or potentially even greater, than the substantial added Medicare costs. Nonetheless, ICI use remains relatively low given large survival benefits and few alternative treatments, suggesting that costs\nand other barriers limit patient access."

While the 2025 System of National Accounts introduces AI as a distinct asset, challenges remain in valuing AI-related investments, inputs, and outputs. Moreover, as a general-purpose technology, AI alters business processes, service quality, and labor organization in ways poorly reflected in official data. This paper outlines key measurement gaps from transformative AI, including the tracking cross-border inputs, quality change, and process changes. We argue that economic statistics should adopt more granular, task-based, and outcome-focused approaches to ensure relevance in an increasingly AI-driven economy."

I review evidence on how trade in LMICs is shaped by frictions in labor, capital, material, land, and information markets, and highlight areas where the evidence base remains thin. I concluded with a discussion of vertical policies relevant for LMICs\u2014particularly the role of services\u2014and suggest areas where further research is needed to assess whether development can be service-led."

We study the effect of fractional ownership on the licensing of copyrighted material and its reuse. To do so, we compile new data on the copyright ownership structure of songs and their licensing for use in movies. We document that fractional song ownership has increased substantially: the mean number of songwriters and publishers per song has tripled between 1958 and 2021. We show that, conditional on a rich set of controls, greater fractionalization is associated with lower likelihood of licensing. We leverage the Sony-led acquisition of EMI Music Publishing in 2012 to obtain within-song variation in ownership and find that consolidating ownership rights significantly increases licensing, beyond any standalone effects of the merger."

        "summary": "We explore the evolving significance of different production sectors within the U.S. economy since World War II and provide methods for estimating and forecasting these shifts. Using a compositional accounting approach, we find that the well-documented transition from goods to services is primarily driven by two compositional changes: 1) the rise of Intellectual Property Products (IPP) as an input producer, replacing Durable Goods almost one-for-one in terms of input shares in virtually all sectors; and 2) a shift in consumer spending from Nondurable Goods to Services. A structural model replicating these shifts reveals that the rise of IPP at the expense of Durable Goods is largely explained by increases in the efficiency of IPP inputs used in production: input-biased technical change. Trend variations in sectoral total factor productivity, and their attendant effects on relative prices and income, are the main driver of evolving consumption patterns. Both reduced-form and structural forecasts project these trends to continue over the next two decades, albeit at lower rates, indicating a slower pace of structural change."

Orbital collision warnings can be unremitting. Whether the object is a defunct satellite or a stray hunk of glass from a solar panel that shattered long ago, every item circling Earth is also a potential projectile.

Each collision then creates more fragments, in a runaway cascade that turns low Earth orbit into a hazard zone.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>For satellite operators, sudden silences could be the first warning signs. Ground station crews that today coordinate elegant sequences of thruster burns will face more chaotic obstacle courses and bigger debris fields blooming across their display monitors. Communication lines and data traffic may drop from time to time, too, sowing chaos on the ground and menacing flights across the globe. And as the slow catastrophe builds, fuel reserves for satellite constellations will bleed down into the red from so many extensive orbital maneuvers. Spacecraft that\u2019ve run dry today will be the seedbed for tumbling, hypervelocity shrapnel tomorrow.</p><p>This doomsday scenario is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Kessler syndrome,</a> named after the American astrophysicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Kessler</a>, who <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19990041784/downloads/19990041784.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in 1976</a> began circulating his first notices at NASA about possible runaway orbital debris. Now, as the magnitude of the <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-space-junk-and-why-is-it-a-problem.html\" target=\"_blank\">space junk problem</a> rapidly scales up, technological responses are ramping up as well. Solutions in the offing include high-resolution orbital tracking, AI-powered constellation management, and an emerging robotic tech called \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/european-space-agency-esa-mission-news-orbital-debris-solar-storms\" target=\"_blank\">active debris removal</a>.\u201d This last item involves lofting a specialized spacecraft into orbit, armed with grippers or other satellite-wrangling tech that can target and grab orbiting stuff. The removal craft then guides the space junk through reentry and the ultimate splashdown of whatever survives reentry into the middle of the ocean.</p><p>But tech alone may not be enough for the magnitude of the task ahead. The debris problem could simply be growing too fast. International treaties and government regulations may be needed to classify orbits as <a href=\"https://www.wfw.com/articles/spectrum-rights-and-orbital-positions-what-do-space-operators-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">globally managed resources, like radio spectrum</a>. Because as Kessler himself has pointed out, space <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/027311779190543S\" target=\"_blank\">is complicated</a>\u2014sometimes <a href=\"https://newspaceeconomy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-kessler-syndrome-2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">frustratingly so</a>.</p><h2>What Is the Kessler Syndrome?</h2><p>In the early days, those frustrations were related to simply getting the space community to realize the problem that lay ahead. Back in the early 1970s, when <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/vleo\" target=\"_blank\">low Earth orbit</a> was all but pristine, Kessler was a midcareer NASA scientist, having already notched important contributions to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program\" target=\"_blank\">Apollo</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab\" target=\"_blank\">Skylab</a> programs. As his colleague, the late NASA administrator <a href=\"https://aquarid.physics.uwo.ca/kessler/Burt%20Cour_Palais.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Burton Cour-Palais</a>, noted in a 2004 <a href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/Cour-PalaisBG/Cour-PalaisBG_3-1-04.htm\" target=\"_blank\">oral history</a>, Kessler \u201cwas bringing up this orbital debris thing, and the higher-ups did not want to know about it at all.\u201d</p><p>Cour-Palais also recalled being told to urge Kessler to \u201ccome up with solutions rather than problems.\u201d Fortunately, neither took the overly cautious route.</p><p>In June 1978, the <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21562202\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em></em></a><em> </em>published a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JA083iA06p02637\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> by Kessler and Cour-Palais in which they argued that a rapidly growing belt of defunct satellites, collision fragments, and other detritus could \u201cbe a significant problem during the next century.\u201d It\u2019s a prediction that has come to pass. In April of this year, Kessler and <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wzjd6/professor-hugh-lewis\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Lewis</a>, professor of astronautics at the <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Birmingham</a>, in England, presented their <a href=\"https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/sdc9/paper/305/SDC9-paper305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">latest models</a>, concluding that space junk orbiting between 400 and 1,000 kilometers\u2014where most low Earth satellites operate\u2014is already unstable. And between 520 and 1,000 km, the researchers found, debris concentrations are at or near levels that might sustain runaway growth.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\"><noscript><img alt=\"scatter visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25069014/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div><p>A recent internal report shared with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em><em>, </em></em>written by analysts at the Menlo Park, Calif.\u2013based <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, has divided the problem into what it calls \u201cfour waves of the Kessler syndrome.\u201d The first three waves, it says, may have already begun. They are: nontrackable stuff like tiny steel fragments and glass splinters colliding with non-operational trackable objects; nontrackable stuff impacting functioning satellites and causing malfunctions; and trackable objects hitting other trackable objects and creating a clouds of fragments. The fourth wave, in which two large pieces of debris incite a chain reaction of other collisions, has yet to occur. In LeoLabs\u2019 observations and models, satellites and operational spacecraft including the International Space Station, and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_space_station\" target=\"_blank\">Tiangong</a> space station continue to face manageable levels of collision avoidance maneuvers\u2014for now.</p><p>\u201cIt is assumed these operational satellites will avoid catastrophic collisions with trackable objects,\u201d the report concludes.</p><p>But according to <a href=\"https://www.swfsummit.org/luc-piguet\" target=\"_blank\">Luc Piguet</a>, CEO and cofounder of the Lausanne, Switzerland\u2013based startup <a href=\"https://clearspace.today/\" target=\"_blank\">ClearSpace</a>, challenges for operational satellites are real and mounting. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is a slow, crawling effect\u2014that when it starts accelerating, it\u2019s already too late,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Kessler syndrome is happening.\u201d</p><p>The problem can be further segmented into specific problematic orbits, according to <a href=\"https://aiaa.org/people/darren-mcknight/\" target=\"_blank\">Darren McKnight</a>, senior technical fellow at <a href=\"https://leolabs.space/\" target=\"_blank\">LeoLabs</a>, which performs high-resolution debris tracking for private clients and government agencies.</p><p>\u201cThere are certain altitudes where we\u2019ve already passed the threshold for the Kessler syndrome,\u201d McKnight says. For instance, at 775 km altitude, as well as at 840 km and 975 km, the collision risk is scaling up rapidly. (See graph, \u201cLow Earth Orbit\u2019s Most High-Risk Places.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cWe will hit a point where particular popular orbits are so risky to operate in that the benefits of operating there are outweighed by the cost and risk,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.daniellerwood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danielle Wood</a>, head of <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Media Lab</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-enabled/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Space Enabled Research Group</a>.</p><h2>Why Is the Kessler Syndrome Complicated?</h2><p><a href=\"https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">According to the European Space Agency</a>, 14.5 million kilograms of man-made stuff circles the planet today. Compare that to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230930201159/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">11 million</a> kg two years ago and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200818221915/https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">8.9 million</a> kg in 2020\u2014a 63 percent increase over the past five years.</p><p>McKnight says the Kessler problem comes into sharper focus when dividing mass in any given orbit by the volume of space that orbit occupies. The <em><em>mass density </em></em>in orbit, also known as the mass per cubic kilometer, provides a clue not only to the chance of orbital collisions but also to those collisions\u2019 consequences. Two small orbiting items colliding won\u2019t create nearly as much new debris as will two big ones. The more densely packed an orbit is, in other words, the more treacherous it is to keep a satellite at that orbit. \u201cMass per cubic kilometer is debris-generating potential,\u201d McKnight says, which would be a great thing to know with confidence in all the different regions of low Earth orbit.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Solar panel with three impact holes and visible damage on each section.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ff39b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/solar-panel-with-three-impact-holes-and-visible-damage-on-each-section.png?id=61618553&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 2002, Space Shuttle astronauts retrieved these solar panels from the Hubble Space Telescope\u2014revealing how destructive even small projectiles are when traveling at low Earth orbit speeds.  </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ESA </small></p><p>However, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kcourtneybis/\" target=\"_blank\">Katherine Courtney</a>, chair of the <a href=\"https://gnosisnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Network on Sustainability in Space</a>, knowing where all orbiting stuff is today has become a tall order. \u201cA substantial portion of smaller space junk can only be extrapolated using data collected from returned spacecraft and historical records. The vast majority can\u2019t be tracked from the ground,\u201d Courtney adds.</p><p>Moreover, says <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/people/jonathan-mcdowell\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan McDowell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-mcdowell-19b0997/\" target=\"_blank\">astrophysicist and space historian</a> at the Harvard & Smithsonian <a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Astrophysics</a>, in Cambridge, Mass., once stuff in orbit goes missing, further complications emerge. Collisions between the missing matter and other debris can completely knock the collisions\u2019 by-products into different orbits.</p><p>\u201cThe operating satellites are in nice circular orbits,\u201d McDowell says, \u201cwhereas the collision debris is crossing many orbits and affecting many more.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s now needed as the problem grows larger is a complete rethink, says <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/jah\" target=\"_blank\">Moriba Jah</a>, professor of <a href=\"https://www.ae.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics</a> at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to the Kessler syndrome,\u201d Jah says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cascading collisions can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s that the framework oversimplifies the problem and doesn\u2019t give us a way to manage or evolve the system.\u201d</p><p>Consider instead, Jah says, a parameter he calls \u201corbital carrying capacity.\u201d \u201cIf we start from the end, we can say that carrying capacity is consumed when our ability to make decisions to avert harm no longer work,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo to me, that doesn\u2019t necessarily look like you\u2019re bumping into stuff. It also looks like you\u2019re spending fuel moving around stuff so much that you can\u2019t do the things that you wanted to do to begin with.\u201d</p><h2>How to Avoid Satellite Collisions</h2><p>As SpaceX proved 144,404 times from December 2024 through May of this year, the Starlink constellation\u2019s capacity to maneuver its hardware around space junk is impressive.</p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink</a> is a brilliant constellation,\u201d McKnight says. \u201cThey\u2019re like a granny driving on the highway. They pump their brakes. They avoid everything.\u201d</p><p>However, Starlink\u2019s own public record also showcases how rapidly the collision hazards in orbit are evolving. The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://universemagazine.com/en/starlink-satellites-performed-26-thousand-avoidance-maneuvers/\" target=\"_blank\">publicly disclosed data</a> reveals a 22-fold increase since 2020 in the amount of ducking and dodging the constellation has needed to perform to avoid collisions with other stuff in orbit.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s ducking and dodging these days, too.</p><p>\u201cCollision avoidance is a standard practice now for every operator,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Flohrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Flohrer</a>, head of the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris\" target=\"_blank\">Space Debris Office</a>.</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep your operations making sense, communicating with everybody else,\u201d says <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/person/marlon-sorge\" target=\"_blank\">Marlon Sorge</a>, technical fellow at the Chantilly, Va.\u2013based <a href=\"https://aerospace.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Aerospace Corp.</a>, \u201cand not making more of the stuff that you can\u2019t communicate with.\u201d</p><p>Yet, space junk isn\u2019t the only class of noncommunicative stuff up there. \u201cMore than half of the unidentified objects are Chinese satellites,\u201d says Courtney of the Global Network on Sustainability in Space. \u201cSo they\u2019re active satellites, but they\u2019re just not registered as identifiable objects.\u201d</p><p>The tracked debris, the untrackable tiny debris, the bigger things that are also incommunicado\u2014all of it combines to make for an increasingly massive headache.</p><p>\u201cEvery collision-avoidance maneuver is a nuisance,\u201d Holger Krag, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-krag-72895324/\" target=\"_blank\">head of ESA\u2019s Space Safety office</a>, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/AI-autonomous-space-debris-avoidance-esa\" target=\"_blank\">has said.</a> \u201cNot only because of fuel consumption but also because of the preparation that goes into it. We have to book ground-station passes, which costs money. Sometimes we even have to switch off the acquisition of scientific data. We have to have an expert team available round the clock.\u201d</p><p>So who or what, then, could possibly keep up with the rapidly scaling nature of the Kessler problem? Artificial intelligence is the almost unanimous answer.</p><p>Many of the world\u2019s major players in low Earth orbit, including <a href=\"https://content.neuraspace.com/product-launch\" target=\"_blank\">small satellite startups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation/Artificial_intelligence_in_space\" target=\"_blank\">big national space programs</a>, are currently testing and developing AI constellation-management systems.

Some <a href=\"https://flypix.ai/blog/space-debris-mapping/\" target=\"_blank\">companies</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2506.02614v4\" target=\"_blank\">research teams</a> are also developing AI tools to go beyond just keeping pace with the problem, using AI to optimize fuel usage and maintain ideal satellite configurations for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15574\" target=\"_blank\">low battery usage and simplified signal traffic</a> as well.</p><p>However, for all its smarts, AI still can\u2019t make the most difficult orbital hazards go away.

You have the same amount of real estate, but you can put more objects in there more safely when you have better visibility and situational awareness of where everything is. It\u2019s the same in space.\u201d</p><h2>What Are the Solutions to the Kessler Problem?</h2><p>Space tech and space tech alone may one day resolve the Kessler syndrome.</p><p>But as a complement to the technological innovation, international space agreements and law are also being reconsidered, because much of the existing space law standards were agreed on decades ago, during an entirely different era in low Earth orbit.</p><p>For instance, between the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty\" target=\"_blank\">Outer Space Treaty of 1967</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Liability_Convention\" target=\"_blank\">1972 Space Liability Convention,</a> even an untraceable fragment of metal in space is effectively owned by the nation that launched it. This arguably means that that nation may need to give permission for anyone else to remove the fragment from orbit.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no national borders up there,\u201d says Faiola. \u201cBut every object that is cataloged is also owned by someone, a state. And you\u2019re not allowed to touch someone else\u2019s stuff without their permission.\u201d</p><p>In August, Japan <a href=\"https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/japan-launches-international-rules-for-space-debris-removal/60484/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> it would be developing its own legal frameworks for removing space junk from orbit. And this November, in Vienna, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs will be <a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/2025-un-conference-on-space-law-and-policy.html\" target=\"_blank\">hosting a space law conference</a> to tackle these issues as well.</p><p>International agreements need reconsidering in other ways, too. Some space experts <em><em>Spectrum </em></em>spoke with argue for additional regulations to prevent orbits from further clogging up.</p><p>\u201cThere will have to be internationally coordinated agreements on who gets what orbit and how many satellites you can have in that orbit,\u201d says Smithsonian\u2019s McDowell.</p><p>Courtney envisions something like a worldwide space command network. \u201cWe need to be designing solutions that allow the growth to continue,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we need is a global space traffic control solution like we have for air traffic today.\u201d</p><p>Jah of the University of Texas at Austin argues for ultimately bringing orbital space closer to its original state of being, as he puts it, \u201ca viable commons.\u201d When a new player\u2014whether a company or a national space agency\u2014wants to put something into a given orbit, he says, that new orbiting asset should be added to a master spreadsheet somewhere.</p><p>\u201cIf another country wants to be able to be in that orbit, there should be an equitable way to share the carrying capacity of that orbit,\u201d he says.</p><p>Rockets, satellites, and launch systems today still follow the space race\u2013era legacy designs that treat orbital space like an infinite junkyard, he adds. \u201cRight now, every single object that we launch into orbit is the equivalent of a single-use plastic,\u201d Jah says. \u201cWe need to invest in reusable and recyclable satellites.\u201d</p><p>Even if the Kessler problem on the home planet can be solved, says Courtney, the same thing could happen on other planets and moons. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about low Earth orbit, but [there\u2019s also] all the commercial activity and all of the great-power competition for landing things on the moon and Mars,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWe have no space-traffic coordination solutions for <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-01/cis-lunar-space-and-the-security-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">cislunar space</a>, and yet that\u2019s the race that\u2019s just starting now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding outward into the solar system, and we\u2019re just taking these problems with us.\u201d <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

A senior studying biomedical engineering at the<a href=\"https://www.uanl.mx/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n</a> (UANL), in Monterrey, Mexico, she is the founding chair of her school\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.embs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</a> (EMBS) student branch. The student member\u2019s research interests in<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/neuroscience\" target=\"_self\"> neuroengineering</a> and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> artificial intelligence</a> are shaping her vision for the future of health care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about technology and health,\u201d she says. \u201cBiomedical engineering is giving me a way to combine these two worlds and work on solutions that make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p><p>Her growing influence in<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE</a> coupled with her academic achievements signal a promising, influential career.</p><h2>From chemistry to caring </h2><p>Ramirez was born in<a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/676/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Zacatecas, Mexico</a>, known for its silver mines, agriculture, and strong cultural pride. From a young age, she loved science\u2014particularly chemistry\u2014and thrived in schools designated for advanced learners.</p><p>Her first exposure to the health care field came during high school, when she trained as a nursing technician. Her high school curriculum was organized as a co-op program, which included traditional classes alternating with internships in nursing. Ramirez interned at the <a href=\"https://www.medicina.uanl.mx/hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez</a> in Monterrey, Mexico.</p><p>Alternating between the academic and vocational tracks allowed her to graduate with a diploma and a technical degree at the same time. Speaking of her early experiences, she says, \u201cI saw how many patients struggled, not just with their conditions but also with the logistics of seeking and coordinating treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat made me want to work at the intersection of medicine and innovation.\u201d</p><p>With her father working as a materials engineer and her mother as an accountant, she grew up in a household where technical problem-solving and analytical thinking were part of daily life.</p><p>That blend of influences reinforced her decision to pursue engineering as a career rather than the medical field, she says.</p><h2>Exploring neuroengineering and AI</h2><p>Since beginning her studies at UANL in 2021, Ramirez has focused on neuroengineering, one of three specializations the school offers. She has explored the role artificial intelligence plays in diagnosing and treating conditions including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alzheimers-disease\" target=\"_self\"> Alzheimer\u2019s disease</a>,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\"> </a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-brain-stimulation-depression\" target=\"_self\">depression</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/epilepsy\" target=\"_self\">, epilepsy</a>, and<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/schizophrenia\" target=\"_self\"> schizophrenia</a>.</p><p>Through the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_self\">IEEE mentoring program</a>, she received guidance from global experts including a doctor from India who helped refine her early AI projects.</p><p>Her work quickly evolved from class assignments to projects with real-world potential.</p><p>\u201cThe project I\u2019m most excited about has not been published, but it mainly consisted of using convolutional neural networks in medical image processing (MRI) and machine learning in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases,\u201d she says.</p><p>This year she broadened her scope by attending the IEEE<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Conference on Robotics and Automation</a> in Atlanta, where she gained exposure to both industrial and academic applications of robotics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick. I want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Currently she is an intern at <a href=\"https://www.aunainvestors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Auna</a>, a health care network in Latin America. She contributes to improving the patient experience in hospitals across Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.</p><p>\u201cI design projects aimed at improving the quality of care and making the hospital intervention more effective for patients across different stages: prevention/wellness, diagnosis, hospitalization, rehabilitation, and post-discharge follow-up,\u201d She declined to provide specific examples, citing medical confidentiality agreements.</p><p>\u201cMy internship is about finding ways to make health care not just effective but also more humane,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about improving processes so patients feel cared for\u2014from the moment they enter the hospital until they leave.\u201d</p><h2>Finding leadership and purpose in IEEE</h2><p>Ramirez founded the IEEE EMBS student branch in 2023. As chair, she represents the branch at <a href=\"https://r9.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Region 9</a> meetings, where she advocates for mentorship opportunities and collaboration with other IEEE groups.</p><p>Through her involvement, she says, she has gained not only technical knowledge but also critical soft skills in leadership, time management, and teamwork.</p><p>\u201cIEEE taught me how to lead with empathy and how to work with people from different backgrounds,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has expanded my vision beyond Mexico, showing me challenges and innovations happening all over the world.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree abroad\u2014potentially in public health or AI for medical devices\u2014and ultimately a Ph.D. Her long-term goal is to launch a business focused on developing health care innovations, specifically in disease prevention.</p><h2>A future built on innovation</h2><p>For Ramirez, improving health care means more than developing cutting-edge technology. It also involves rethinking how people understand and manage their own health.</p><p>\u201cIn Mexico, people usually don\u2019t think about their health until they\u2019re already sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to focus on using technology and education to keep people healthy.\u201d</p><p>Her vision is as ambitious as it is personal, rooted in her own journey from Zacatecas to Monterrey and beyond.</p><p>As her career advances, she says, she intends to keep IEEE at the center of her professional life.</p><p>\u201cIn IEEE I\u2019ve found a community that challenges me to grow, supports me when I fail, and celebrates when I succeed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about engineering; it\u2019s about building a better future, together.\u201d</p>"

Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.<br /></p><p>Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July. Leathers uses his <span>28</span>-foot (8.5-meter) boat for cultivating oysters at <a href=\"https://maineoceanfarms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maine Ocean Farms</a>, where roughly <span>3</span> million of the animals grow in dozens of floating cages.</p><p>Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine\u2019s <span>3</span>,<span>500</span> miles (5,633 kilometers) of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor. For Leathers, whose <span>10</span>-acre (4-hectare) sea farm is a significant presence in the cove where he operates, the swap is about being a good neighbor to the shoreside community.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>It\u2019s an innovation born from necessity for us,\u201d said Strater about his electric boat, which he docks each night at the <a href=\"https://www.seameadow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sea Meadow Marine Foundation</a>, the nonprofit boatyard and aquaculture innovation hub he runs with several other small business owners. \u201c[The boat] really works well for what we do with it, and we\u2019re letting farmers use it to see how it could work for them.\u201d</p><h2>The Rise of Electric Boats</h2><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-boats\" target=\"_blank\">Battery-powered vessels</a> are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/the-first-all-electric-tugboat-in-the-us-is-about-to-launch\" target=\"_blank\">tugboats</a>, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.</p><p>In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world\u2019s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>Everyone\u2019s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we\u2019ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,\u201d said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. ferries</a>. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two men stand outside the cockpit of an electric boat named Heron that sits on the water.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6e15a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-men-stand-outside-the-cockpit-of-an-electric-boat-named-heron-that-sits-on-the-water.jpg?id=61664831&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Maine Ocean Farms founders Eric Oransky [left] and Willy Leathers switched to an electric workboat in July 2025.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.bullockweddings.com/index/G0000YGZ6gDoqSck\" target=\"_blank\">Brendan Bullock</a></small></p><p><span>Electrification has only very recently come to the U.S. aquaculture sector. In Maine, the small but fast-growing segment includes nearly </span><a href=\"https://maineaqua.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>200</span> farms</a><span> for shellfish, fin fish, and edible seaweed. Strater and Leathers are among the first in their business to trade gas motors for electric propulsion\u2014a switch they say they\u2019re hoping to accelerate. Oil-guzzling motors are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the state\u2019s multibillion-dollar seafood sector.</span></p><p>Still, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-container-ships-are-stuck-on-the-horizon\" target=\"_blank\">electrifying commercial watercraft can be a difficult course to navigate</a>, given the higher up-front costs of electric motors and the lack of charging infrastructure\u2014and grid infrastructure in general\u2014in rural waterfront communities.</p><p>Early adopters like Strater and Leathers said they hope the experiences gained from their demonstrations can help pave the way for decarbonizing Maine\u2019s blue economy. With the help of the <a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Island Institute</a>, a Maine-based nonprofit that works on marine-related energy transitions, Leathers is collecting performance data from his vessel to share more broadly with the industry.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>People say it looks cool and shiny and looks like it operates great,\u201d Lia Morris, the Island Institute\u2019s senior community development officer, said of electric boats. <span>\u201c</span>But we really want to be able to prove out the [business] case.\u201d <span>Electric boats can cost between </span><span>20 percent</span><span> and </span><span>30 percent</span><span> more than a gas- or diesel-powered vessel of a comparable size. However, owners can save on maintenance and fuel over the long term, Strater\u2019s business partner Nick Planson said.</span><br /></p><p><span>\u201c</span>The high-level math that we\u2019ve come up with\u201d is a financial break-even point of <span>\u201c</span>about four to five years, and then over a <span>10</span>-year time span, you\u2019re definitely coming out way ahead based on the vastly reduced maintenance cost, replacement cost of failed equipment, and fuel costs,\u201d said Planson.</p><h2>Battery-Powered Workboats Lack Charging Infrastructure</h2><p>But the initial price tag presents a significant hurdle. Strater and Planson\u2019s sleekly designed, no-frills watercraft cost US $<span>100</span>,<span>000</span> to build and outfit with a single electric outboard motor. Leathers\u2019s boat, called Heron, cost about four times as much. It has two electric outboards and a ramp for unloading and hauling more than <span>10</span>,<span>000</span> oysters at a time from the sea farm to distributors waiting on the dock. Its hull is also equipped with a small cabin and toilet.</p><p>Both operations relied on grant funding to defray the expense of going electric.</p><p>For their part, Strater and Planson used about $<span>50</span>,<span>000</span> from a larger U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/1031783-an-electric-workboat-for-the-aquaculture-industry.html\" target=\"_blank\">small business grant</a> they got in <span>2024</span> to establish a use case for electric workboats in the aquaculture industry. Leathers\u2019s business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $<span>500</span>,<span>000</span> U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) <a href=\"https://www.aquaculturenorthamerica.com/maine-ocean-farms-adopts-electric-workboats-for-oyster-farming/#:~:text=The%20company%20was%20able%20to%20bring%20this,of%20Energy%2C%20Office%20of%20Energy%20Efficiency%20and\" target=\"_blank\">grant</a> last year that earmarked about $<span>289</span>,<span>000</span> for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.</p><p>The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.</p><p>The <span>DOE</span>\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it\u2019s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d says Strater.</p><p>But federal grants aren\u2019t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises, Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a <span>\u201c</span>marine green\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ceimaine.org/financing/small-business-loans/#marine-green-loans\" target=\"_blank\">loan program</a> that can make the up-front costs of switching to electric propulsion more accessible to small businesses.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,\u201d said Nick Branchina, director of <span>CEI</span>\u2019s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, <span>CEI</span> offers loans starting at $<span>25</span>,<span>000</span> for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.</p><p><span>Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to </span><span>\u201c</span><span>take a reasonable swing\u201d at electric propulsion.</span></p><p>Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.</p><h2>How Do Electric Boats Perform in Cold Weather?</h2><p><span></span><span>This summer, Leathers said he\u2019s had no trouble making the nearly 2-mile (3-kilometer) round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he\u2019s not sure how far the outboards\u2019 two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor\u2019s range. It\u2019s a part of Leathers\u2019s demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.</span></p><p>Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they\u2019re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of <span>2024</span>. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, <a href=\"https://www.shredelectric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shred Electric</a>, a boat\u2019s ability to run through the year\u2019s coldest months is a key selling point.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>The proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Planson. <span>\u201c</span>When you\u2019re working with\u2026waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.\u201d</p><p>Strater and Planson said their boat\u2019s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations 7 miles (11 kilometers) away. In the <span>10</span> months since the boat\u2019s launch, Strater has learned that range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat\u2019s pace depending on how far he wants to go.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,\u201d he said.</p><p><span></span><span>Soon, Maine\u2019s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level </span><span>2</span><span> charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over 2 hours, or three times as fast as the current system. The startup </span><a href=\"https://www.aqua-superpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua SuperPower</a><span> was awarded a portion of the </span><span>DOE</span><span> funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.</span></p><p>Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said Morris, of the Island Institute. As the state\u2019s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.</p><p>Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a <span>\u201c</span>chicken and egg\u201d problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there\u2019s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.</p><p>This challenge is compounded by both New England\u2019s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region\u2019s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it\u2019s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route <span>1</span>.</p><p><span>\u201c</span>There are a lot of complicated questions,\u201d Morris said. <span>\u201c</span>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to Maine, it\u2019s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.\u201d</p><p>Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm\u2019s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.</p><p><span></span><span>\u201c</span><span>As a whole industry, I think it\u2019s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,\u201d Leathers said. </span><span>\u201c</span><span>And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.\u201d</span> </p>"

In collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE History Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/globalmuseum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Global Museum</a> and the support of generous donors, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/chip-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_self\">Chip Hall of Fame</a> has been adapted into a traveling exhibit that has just begun making its way around U.S. museums, and, hopefully, the world.</p><p>Our Chip Hall of Fame celebrates microchips that have had a significant impact. Six of the chips from the hall were chosen to be part of the \u201cChips That Shook The World\u201d exhibit, along with artifacts embodying how each was used. One of the chosen was the 8-bit <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6502-microprocessor/\" target=\"_self\">6502</a> processor, so naturally we thought a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/commodore-64\" target=\"_self\">Commodore 64</a> home computer, which used a 6502 variant, should be one of the artifacts. Which led to another thought: Why not have the C64 run a program demonstrating an 8-bit CPU in action?</p><p>That\u2019s how I ended up, 35 years after I last programmed a C64, sitting at my office desk creating a brand-new plug-in cartridge.</p><p>The C64 supported <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Cartridge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plug-in cartridges</a> as a way of distributing software, and our demo program needed to be put on one. Each morning, the museum curator can just turn on the exhibit and presto! The demo program instantly begins running. The alternatives would have required the curator to type in commands to load the demo manually.</p><p>But this convenience comes with two big caveats: One, the demo has to fit into just 16 kilobytes, the maximum size of a cartridge. Even by the standards of the 1980s, this is small, as some C64 titles spanned <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Newcomer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of kilobytes</a> by loading data in chunks from disk or tape. Two, the demo would have to be written in <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-6502-assembly-and-low-level-programming-7c11fa6b9cb9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6502 assembly</a> and control the C64 video hardware directly.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"The components required to make a Commodore 64 cartridge.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"95d88\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-components-required-to-make-a-commodore-64-cartridge.png?id=61614662&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cartridges require only a few components: a printed circuit board [bottom right], programmable memory chip [bottom middle], and some resistors, diodes, and a capacitor [top middle]. They are mounted in a 3D-printed shell [top left and right]. To make the video output compatible with modern screens, we used a RetroTink-2X Pro adapter [bottom left].</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Fortunately, from attending <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/theyre-alive-vintage-computer-fans-keep-the-great-machines-of-the-past-running\" target=\"_self\">Vintage Computer Federation events</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6ZCubprsSO/\" target=\"_blank\"> over the years</a>, I knew there were a lot of free or inexpensive resources that would make it easier than ever before to do this sort of thing.</p><p>The first step was to figure out just how much I could do in 16 KB. The C64\u2019s graphics hardware was groundbreaking in its day, capable of displaying images of up to 320 by 200 pixels with a palette of 16 colors. It could also display eight sprites at once; each sprite is a moveable single-color 24-by-21 pixel bitmap. The price for this power was complexity. The <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/VIC\" target=\"_blank\">video chip\u2019s control registers</a>, screen bitmaps, text-screen data, default and custom character sets, sprites, and color information all live in different locations scattered across memory, with some data actually living in <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color_RAM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">separate RAM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Character_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ROM</a> chips.</p><p>So I sat down with the detailed <a href=\"https://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">memory maps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Graphics_Modes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video hardware programming guides</a> available for the C64. (This abundance of information is in stark contrast to the 1980s, when documentation was scant, even from Commodore itself). I worked out that I could cram in nine screens of explanatory text, animated graphics, and sprites. Creating these screens, including the custom character sets and sprites they rely on, was greatly simplified thanks to the online C64 graphics editor at <a href=\"https://petscii.krissz.hu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">petscii.krissz.hu</a>. The editor can output some results as stand-alone assembly programs, which I adapted as subroutines in my demo code.</p><p>I had just enough space remaining for a lucky find. I wanted to display at least one full-screen bitmapped image, but a prerendered image would have required 8 KB of data, half the cartridge\u2019s capacity. Instead I decided to use a classic hack of programmers since the days of games like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Rogue</em></em></a><em> </em>and<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Elite</em></em></a>: pulling free data out of the structure of mathematics by way of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">procedural generation</a>.</p><p>Here\u2019s where I got lucky: I came across the work of Marcello M., who had published the source for a C64 <a href=\"https://retro64.altervista.org/blog/the-mandelbrot-set-c64-assembly-program-to-draw-it-fast-using-integer-math-part-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">assembly program</a> that quickly created a multicolor fractal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mandelbrot set</a> using just 3.3 KB of code. With Marcello\u2019s blessing, I incorporated his code as another subroutine.</p><h2>Modern Tools For Writing C64 Software</h2><p>The coding was done using the free <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ide65xx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IDE 65xx</a> and <a href=\"https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kick Assembler</a> desktop software. I was able to test the code using the popular C64 <a href=\"https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vice emulator</a>, which allowed me to do handy things like examining live memory contents to find runtime bugs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A diagram showing 64 kilobytes of RAM with a Kernal ROM occupying the top 8 KB, followed by 4 KB of character ROM, and then 8 KB of Basic ROM.

Finally a third column shows a 16 KB cartridge ROM overlapping the Basic ROM and the memory below it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"71b5d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-64-kilobytes-of-ram-with-a-kernal-rom-occupying-the-top-8-kb-followed-by-4-kb-of-character-rom-and-then-8-kb.png?id=61613059&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Regions of the Commodore 64\u2019s RAM were mapped to things like the system ROMs, video-color memory, and the bitmaps of characters, the latter of which were actually mapped to multiple locations in RAM when accessed by the video hardware. Some of these mappings overlapped: Inserting a 16-KB cartridge automatically disabled the ROM storing the Basic interpreter. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p><span>The next step was to make a physical cartridge. Again, there\u2019s modern help, this time in the form of US $5 printed circuit boards that need just a handful of components soldered in to make a cartridge. These components include a programmable ROM chip that I picked up for </span><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/363498306025\" target=\"_blank\">$3 on eBay</a><span>. I burned my code to the memory chip with my trusty </span><a href=\"http://autoelectric.cn/EN/TL866_main.html\" target=\"_blank\">TL866 programmer</a><span> and mounted it to the PCB, which in turn was mounted into a </span><a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:692797\" target=\"_blank\">3D-printed cartridge case</a><span>.</span></p><p>Then came the moment of truth. It probably won\u2019t come as a surprise to regular readers that I already own an original C64, which I connect to modern flat-screen displays via a <a href=\"https://www.retrotink.com/shop/retrotink-2x-pro\" target=\"_blank\">RetroTink-2X Pro</a> adapter. So I carefully pushed the cartridge into its slot and turned the machine on.</p><p>Naturally, my C64 immediately froze up. I had forgotten to remove a little bit of memory-management code that made the demo work in the Vice emulator by disabling the ROM that stores the C64\u2019s Basic interpreter. On the real hardware, this snippet ended up disabling half the cartridge\u2019s memory. A quick edit and a trip back to the TL866 and I was ready to try again. Success! I was finally literally ready to ship some software, all the way to <a href=\"https://www.uplandexhibits.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Upland Exhibits</a>, the people building our traveling display.</p><p>I hope you get a chance to see my little demo and our \u201cChips That Changed The World\u201d exhibit in person: We\u2019ll post current and upcoming locations on the Chip Hall of Fame page. But in the meantime, whether you used the C64 back in the day, or are just looking for a fun coding challenge, I recommend trying your hand at programming this 8-bit classic, now that so many of the original pain points have been reduced!</p>"

This can pose challenges for companies when funding timelines outpace innovations.</p><p>\u201cCompanies aren\u2019t able to make progress quickly enough to keep up with pressure exerted by the investors,\u201d he says.</p><h2>Natron\u2019s Pioneering Prussian Blue Batteries</h2><p>Until recently, Natron was seen as a leader of the pack in the U.S. sodium-ion market. Part of the company\u2019s appeal was its pioneering approach to low-cost electrodes, the conductors at the battery\u2019s positive and negative terminals, which make contact with the non-metallic part of the circuit. The company used <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/p/prussian-blue.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Prussian Blue</span></a>, a pigment found in paints and dyes, to make both the cathode and anode for its <a href=\"https://natron.energy/products\" target=\"_blank\"><span>three battery systems</span></a>. <span><span>In addition to having a low material cost, Prussian Blue\u2019s chemical structure has large pores, helping it facilitate faster ion transfer between the electrodes.</span></span><strong></strong></p><p>Natron was the <a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/search-all-projects/domestic-manufacturing-sodium-ion-batteries\" target=\"_blank\"><span>first in the world</span></a> to commercialize a sodium-ion battery using Prussian Blue, a real feat considering China\u2019s battery manufacturing might, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-evans-a3b36055/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Tyler Evans</span></a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.manabattery.us/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Mana Battery</span></a>, a Broomfield, Colorado-based sodium-ion battery cell startup that launched in 2023.</p><p>\u201cThey were doing it in the West, and they were scaling a technology that was relatively low energy density for a very specific market segment,\u201d says Evans about Natron\u2019s products.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A gloved hand holding up battery cells in a lab.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d0e2f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-gloved-hand-holding-up-battery-cells-in-a-lab.jpg?id=61700811&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Mana is another U.S. startup focusing on bringing sodium-ion batteries to market.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nicholas Singstock/Mana</small></p><p>That market included grid storage, data center power backups, and electric vehicle charging stations\u2014large-scale stationary applications where attributes like safety and cost rank higher than energy density. Natron\u2019s success in this space, including its plans for the North Carolina factory, prompted questions about whether sodium-ion could emerge as a direct replacement for lithium-ion batteries. <a href=\"https://natron.energy/files/news/releases/natron-united-joint-release-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>United Airlines</span></a> and <a href=\"https://enginetech.com/why-is-chevron-investing-in-sodium-ion-batteries/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Chevron</span></a> were on the list of Natron\u2019s investors.</p><p>But Evans says scaling up a low-energy density product while building out manufacturing lines is expensive. \u201cIf you think about building a manufacturing facility where you want to produce 10 gigawatt hours of batteries, if your energy density is very low, producing an equivalent number of batteries requires more manufacturing lines,\u201d Evans says.</p><p>\u201cIf you think about building a manufacturing facility where you want to produce a gigawatt-hour of battery manufacturing capacity, if your energy density per battery cell is very low, producing that capacity requires more manufacturing lines,\u201d Evans says, meaning significantly more capital and operational expenditure in an already capital-intensive undertaking.</p><p>In 2023, Natron\u2019s systems made it to market. The company partnered with <a href=\"https://encorp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Encorp</span></a> to <a href=\"https://sodiumbatteryhub.com/2023/10/06/encorp-natron-energy-hybrid-power-platform/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>deploy</span></a> the industry\u2019s first multi-megawatt class power platform for industrial applications.

The U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s <a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>ARPA-E program</span></a> provided <a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/search-all-projects/domestic-manufacturing-sodium-ion-batteries\" target=\"_blank\"><span>$19.8 million</span></a> to Natron as part of a $300 million facility upgrade to transition from lithium-ion battery manufacturing to sodium-ion battery manufacturing. That facility shut its doors at the same time as Natron\u2019s California headquarters on 3 September.</p><p>A request for comment from Natron resulted in an automated message to contact the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/natrons-liquidation-shows-why-the-us-isnt-ready-to-make-its-own-batteries/\" target=\"_blank\">primary shareholder</a>, Sherwood Partners.

The ability to simulate multiple physical phenomena in a unified modeling environment gives engineers a deeper understanding of how different components of the grid interact with and affect each other.</p><p>For example, when designing the various components of grid infrastructure, such as transformers and transmission lines, multiphysics electromagnetic field analysis is essential for ensuring the safety of the surrounding individuals and environment. Understanding thermal behavior, another phenomenon involving multiple physics, is equally necessary for the design of grid components where heat dissipation and thermal stresses can significantly affect performance and lifespan. Structural and acoustics simulation, meanwhile, is used to predict and mitigate issues like transformer vibration and noise \u2014 an important practice for ensuring the longevity and reliability of grid components.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Multiphysics simulation provides critical insight into the complex interactions at play within power grid components, enabling engineers to virtually test and optimize future grid designs.</p><p>Electric breakdown and corona discharge analyses are particularly vital for high-voltage transmission lines, as such phenomena can compromise the performance of their insulation systems. Simulation allows development teams to predict where such events are likely to happen, enhancing the design of insulators and other components where the goal is to minimize energy loss and material degradation.</p><p><span>As a real-world example, one leading manufacturer uses the <a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae simulation software</a></span><a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics\"> software</a> to develop magnetic couplings, a noncontact alternative to mechanical transmission that enables power transfer without the inherent friction-based limitations of continual contact. While the advantage of friction-free power transmission means that magnetic couplings have found applications in a broad range of technologies, including offshore wind turbines, these systems must be developed carefully to avoid degradation. By employing highly nonlinear hysteresis curves and applying its own material temperature dependences for magnetic loading, the manufacturer\u2019s development team has successfully used multiphysics simulation to help prevent the permanent magnets from reaching critical temperatures, which can cause irreversible demagnetization and compromise the reliability of the designs. Additionally, due to the diverse nature of use cases for magnetic couplings, the company\u2019s design engineers must be able to interchange shapes and materials of magnets to meet customer requirements without building costly and time-consuming prototypes \u2014 rendering multiphysics simulation a powerful approach for characterizing configurations, providing virtual prototypes of their designs, and ultimately reducing the price for customers while remaining vigilant on fine details.</p><p>These examples show just a few of the ways that coupling multiple interacting physics within a single model can lead to successful simulation of real-world phenomena and thereby provide insights into current and future designs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Powerline tower on field; energetic aura and electric flow against a vivid blue sky\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b4c8e\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/powerline-tower-on-field-energetic-aura-and-electric-flow-against-a-vivid-blue-sky.png?id=61634378&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Lightning strikes a tower\u2019s shielded wires. The induced voltage on the three-phase conductors is computed using electromagnetic field analysis.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">COMSOL</small></p><h2>Improving Reliability with Digital Twins & Simulation Apps</h2><p>Engineering teams can also use simulation technology to create more efficient, effective, and sustainable power grids by creating digital twins. A digital twin contains a high-fidelity description of a physical product, device, or process \u2014 from the microscopic to the macroscopic level \u2014 that closely mirrors its real <span>counterpart</span>. For every application, the digital twin is continuously receiving information, ensuring an up-to-date and accurate representation. </p><p><span>With this technology, grid operators and their equipment suppliers can predict which components are most likely to fail, enabling them to schedule maintenance and replacement more efficiently and thereby improving grid reliability. Digital twins can be made for equipment ranging from power sources including solar cells and wind turbines to power distribution systems and battery energy storage.</span></p><p><span><br /></span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Illustration of sea-floor mounted wind turbines generating electricity.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d74bd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-sea-floor-mounted-wind-turbines-generating-electricity.png?id=61634379&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">An offshore wind farm where lightning strikes one of the turbine blades. The electric field on the turbine towers, seawater, and seabed is shown.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">COMSOL</small></p><p>The most recent modeling and simulation technology provides power and energy companies with tools for creating digital twins in the form of standalone simulation apps, which significantly increases the number of users who have access to advanced simulation technology. By including only relevant functionality in a standalone simulation app, colleagues with no modeling and simulation experience can utilize this technology without needing guidance from the modeling specialist. Furthermore, the use of data-driven surrogate models in simulation apps enables near-instantaneous evaluation of what would otherwise be time-consuming simulations \u2014 which means that simulation technology can now be used in a real-world setting.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Digital twins, in the form of standalone apps, bring the power of simulation to the field, where grid operators can utilize real-time performance information to ensure grid reliability.</p><p><span></span><span>For instance, one organization that works with local power companies to analyze equipment maintenance and failure built a custom app based on a multiphysics model it had developed to predict cable faults and improve troubleshooting efficiency. While engineers have been utilizing simulation in labs for decades, cable failure occurs in the field, and onsite troubleshooting personnel are responsible for assessing these failure conditions. With this in mind, an engineer at the organization developed the simulation app using the Application Builder in <a href=\"https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics\" target=\"_blank\">COMSOL Multiphysics</a>\u00ae.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Colorful, stacked layers of a 3D model resembling a futuristic computer chip design.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"93733\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/colorful-stacked-layers-of-a-3d-model-resembling-a-futuristic-computer-chip-design.png?id=61634382&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Temperature distribution in a battery energy storage system (BESS).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">COMSOL</small></p><p>The app features relevant parameters that troubleshooting personnel with no prior simulation experience can easily modify. Field technicians enter cable data and select the type of <span>fault, which modifies the multiphysics model in real time, allowing the app to evaluate</span> and output the data necessary to understand the condition that led to the fault. The app then produces a reported potential and electric field, which leads the technicians to an informed decision regarding whether they need to replace or repair the cable. Following the app\u2019s successful deployment, the engineer who developed it stated, \u201cThe simulation app plays a key role in cable maintenance. It makes the work of our field technicians more efficient by empowering them to confidently assess and repair faults.\u201d</p><p>Routine physical tests of grid equipment cannot fully reflect conditions or determine failure types in many situations, as a large number of complex factors must be considered, such as cable structure and material, impurities in the cable, voltage fluctuation, and operating conditions and environments. As a result, simulation has proven to be indispensable in many cases for collecting accurate cable health assessments \u2014 and now in the form of custom apps, it is more accessible than ever.</p><h2>Generating Nuclear Solutions</h2><p>Simulation has also been heavily integrated into the design process of various components related to the nuclear industry. For example, simulation was used to help design generator circuit breakers (GCBs) for nuclear power plants. GCBs must be reliable and able to maintain performance even after long periods of inactivity. The COMSOL Multiphysics<sup>\u00ae</sup> software can be used to improve the current-carrying capacity of the GCBs, which can offer protection from current surges and provide dependable electricity generation. </p><p>The design of nuclear fusion machines like tokamaks has also benefitted from the use of simulation. These devices must be able to withstand high heat fluxes and plasma disruptions. COMSOL Multiphysics<sup>\u00ae</sup> has been used to help engineers predict the effects of these problems and come up with design solutions, such as adding a structural support system that can help reduce stress and survive challenging conditions.</p><h2>Engineering the Grid of Tomorrow</h2><p>The development of next-generation power grid systems is a complex and dynamic process that requires safe, reliable, and affordable testing. Multiphysics simulation technology can play a major role in future innovations for this industry, enabling engineers to anticipate and analyze the complex interactions happening inside these devices while building upon the existing infrastructure to address the demands of modern-day consumption.</p><p><span></span><em>COMSOL Multiphysics is a registered trademark of COMSOL AB.</em></p>"

There I worked with teachers and other parents to plan and implement annual programs that enriched the students and the school community as a whole.</p><p>Through my work, I\u2019ve realized that volunteering isn\u2019t just about giving back; it\u2019s also a way to learn new skills. Every hour invested adds tangible value to one\u2019s personal and professional growth.</p><p>My experiences have shown me that membership-based organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a> that offer volunteer opportunities should position and market them as top-tier member benefits. Even if not all members volunteer their time, the availability of the opportunities and the inspiration drawn from participating can be powerful catalysts for a more vibrant and committed community.</p><p>The merits of volunteering are universally known and acknowledged. Its powerful capacity to reduce stress and boost feel-good hormones such as dopamine is widely touted, as noted in a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/onemind/2022/11/01/employer-sponsored-volunteerism-doing-good-for-business-mental-health-and-the-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Forbes</em></em> article</a> by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/onemind/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Garen Staglin</a>, the cofounder of One Mind at Work. However, the impacts of volunteering extend far beyond the typical benefits of building a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, acquiring skills, and feeling a sense of fulfillment. The deeper value lies in its ability to enhance <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/tips-on-how-to-elevate-your-career/\" target=\"_self\">professional growth and personal development</a> in less apparent ways.</p><h2>The pros of volunteering</h2><p>Here are five ways in which the \u201cwhy\u201d of purpose can fuel the \u201chow\u201d of growth:</p><ol><li><strong>Opportunities for collaboration.</strong> Volunteering provides an arena for collaboration, bringing together professionals from industry and academia, for example, in tackling shared goals. The dynamic interchange is where true growth happens. It\u2019s not just about what gets done; it\u2019s about the invaluable experience of working with diverse minds to solve problems\u2014an experience that accelerates development in all areas.</li><li><strong>Incubator for leadership.</strong> In an organization such as IEEE, where volunteers are shaping its structure and future through committees and governance bodies, the environment is ideal for developing high-impact professional skills. Volunteering instills leadership skills\u2014including strategic thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to inspire others\u2014that can be utilized in one\u2019s professional (and personal) life.</li><li><strong>Sharpening decision-making abilities.</strong> Volunteering lets you sharpen skills that are sometimes difficult to improve in the structured confines of a typical job. Working outside the usual professional hierarchy, volunteers get a chance to sharpen their critical thinking and decision-making skills with greater autonomy and a clear, mission-driven focus. A volunteering task, such as judging submissions for awards and scholarships, can hone analytical and fair-judgment skills. Planning conferences and events can help develop organizational, project management, and problem-solving abilities.</li><li><strong>Intellectual expansion</strong>. Volunteering is a fantastic way to boost your intellect and uncover hidden potential. Through collaborative problem-solving and organic knowledge-sharing, one can tackle complex issues. As you move from one task to the next, the skills can build on each other, creating a compounding effect that rapidly enhances your abilities.</li><li><strong>Staying current, relatable, and confident. </strong>A cumulative benefit of volunteering is that it can serve as a professional refresh for one\u2019s skills and perspective and can expose you to new technologies and trends outside of your field. You can learn to connect and communicate more effectively across generations and backgrounds by working alongside a diverse group of people. The collaborative environment also can provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate expertise in new ways and receive peer recognition, which in turn can reinforce your professional value and boost your confidence.</li></ol><p>Volunteering isn\u2019t just for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/celebrating-young-professionals-and-students/\" target=\"_self\">young professionals</a>; it can be a catalyst for people at every stage of their career. It can boost mid-career professionals\u2019 confidence, enabling them to hone their skills and tackle new challenges. For senior-level professionals, volunteering can expand their networks, providing fresh perspectives and collaborative opportunities outside traditional silos.</p><p>Any organization that provides volunteering opportunities is providing members or employees a valuable chance for an active investment in themselves. </p>"

Going from a five-person company to a 500-person company was daunting, especially since I had never worked in a hypergrowth organization. I talked previously about <a href=\"https://connect.ieee.org/NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGdELaJNU0IxvmlSacEixXmQHimVEcG9B5tmWq4KWGUCiUUGed4mEKL4fbUlfgQO7hUbrsGBPs=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best practices for onboarding</a>, but I want to specifically focus on an area that I sorely neglected: the skip-level one-on-one meeting.</p><p>Your \u201cskip\u201d is the person your manager reports to, often a director or vice president. It\u2019s what happens when you \u201cskip\u201d your manager up the reporting chain. Many of the ideas from a previous newsletter, <a href=\"https://connect.ieee.org/NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGdELaJNQgenK7FoHqf_C3UsOx1BGJxgIt8WQ2ZqhoTcqEohX99Wl3ZQRj3d_MksQHNOWy7fqA=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Making the Most of 1:1 Meetings With Your Boss</a>, carry over here, but skip-level 1:1 should be treated differently. The skip meeting can feel either nerve-wracking or irrelevant for many engineers, but it\u2019s actually a unique opportunity to accelerate your <span>career</span>.</p><p>Here\u2019s how you can get the most value from your skip-level meetings:</p><ul><li><strong>Understand your organization\u2019s overall strategy</strong>. Your skip manager has a broader scope and set of responsibilities compared to most people you interact with. This means they are naturally equipped to answer questions around organizational strategy. Ask them what their priorities are, and how your work contributes to the priorities they care about.</li><li><strong>Share \u201con the ground\u201d insights</strong>. No matter how hands-on they are, senior leaders are often disconnected from day-to-day work. As an individual contributor, you are well-equipped to share the experience of getting work done, both the good and the bad. This can be especially valuable if you can proactively suggest ideas to improve everyone\u2019s productivity.</li><li><strong>Be honest with feedback</strong>. A truly effective skip-level meeting requires you to be unafraid to share real problems and provide honest feedback. This is an opportunity to discuss systemic issues that your direct manager may not be able to address on their own.</li></ul><p>At Pinterest, one of the first decisions I had to make was about which team within the company I would join. Had I properly leveraged the advice from the director, I could have received valuable feedback about high-priority areas in the company. Whether you\u2019re new at a company or not, don\u2019t squander the value of building a relationship with your management chain.</p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/4-ways-conquer-imposter-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">4 Ways to Conquer Imposter Syndrome</a></h2><p>Nearly 70 percent of high-achieving adults have experienced the feelings of self-doubt that characterize imposter syndrome.
