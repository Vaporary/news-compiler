Beyond the direct damages, market distortions, supply chains, changes in capital and labor costs, etc. can potentially magnify (or diminish) the costs of these shocks. In this paper, we use analytical and numerical general equilibrium models to investigate the channels through which microeconomic shocks affect the macroeconomy. We model different types of shocks, evaluate how anticipation affects the macroeconomic implications of shocks, and measure the overall welfare costs relative to the value of direct damages. We find that preexisting taxes magnify the overall welfare costs relative to direct damages, that savings and investment decisions driven by anticipations of certain types of shocks can interact with tax distortions to lower welfare costs, and that the ratio of welfare cost to direct damages varies substantially across sectors of the economy."

        "summary": "We coin the term Global Stratification Economics (GSE) to extend Stratification Economics (SE) to international contexts where mechanisms emerge that can be identified as (1) universal but matched to positioning along a country\u2019s development path or (2) context-specific and historically dependent in ways different from the United States and other international environments. Building on SE\u2019s core insight that groups compete over scarce resources and that dominant groups shape rules to preserve advantage, we define GSE as an approach that foregrounds historical genesis (e.g., settler colonialism, slavery, caste, extractive governance, military intervention), local institutions that structure dominance and resistance, and transnational mechanisms (e.g., imported stratification and the lateral mobility hypothesis) that link origin- and destination-country hierarchies. Drawing on evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the global macroeconomy, we synthesize research on intergenerational mobility, wealth and asset inequality, labor-market segmentation, colorism, caste and ethnicity, gendered and intersectional constraints, spatial inequality and property regimes, and global value chains. We conclude by outlining how GSE reshapes measurement and international policy evaluation by centering group-differentiated outcomes, institutional transformation, and pillars of recognition, redistribution, and repair and by offering a checklist for researchers to apply GSE."

        "summary": "We present new evidence on how firms set prices using direct questions from a large, economy-wide survey of UK firms. Since 2023, 54% of firms report setting prices in a state-dependent manner, as opposed to changing prices at fixed intervals. In contrast, 44% of firms used state-dependent pricing in 2019. Smaller firms, those with a higher share of non-labour costs, and those reporting higher subjective uncertainty around sales and prices are more likely to be state-dependent. We then analyse the implications of price-setting behaviour for inflation dynamics. State-dependent firms experienced a sharper increase in price growth over 2022-2023, and also a faster subsequent decline. Using evidence from a randomised survey experiment, firm-level forecast errors, and local projections, we show that prices of state-dependent firms respond faster to cost shocks. The difference between state-dependent and time-dependent firms is furthermore larger for bigger shocks, consistent with theoretical predictions."

        "summary": "In models with subjective beliefs, the dynamics of investor beliefs are central to explaining asset price movements. Allowing subjective beliefs to deviate from full-information rational expectations requires a model of how investors form beliefs. I review recent research that explores experience-based belief formation. The experience-based model closely resembles Bayesian updating but allows individuals to overweight data observed during their own lifetimes when forming beliefs about the parameters of the data-generating process. Because individuals of different age learn from different histories, the model predicts heterogeneity between age groups that evolves over time with the path of realized data individuals have experienced, closely mirroring the age-related variation observed in survey microdata. At the aggregate level, experience-based expectations formation can explain asset price dynamics. In the stock market, learning from experience about long-run cash flow growth generates valuation cycles and return predictability. Experience-based formation of long-term inflation expectations can explain secular changes of real interest rates. I conclude by outlining directions for future research."

        "summary": "Using surveys and administrative data from representative samples of drivers working on three leading gig platforms in India, Indonesia, and Kenya, we document the composition, economic experiences, and labor market trajectories of platform workers. Combining platform-based earnings with operating cost data, we estimate earnings net of costs (in PPP-adjusted terms) in each context. We find that the flexible nature of platform work enables drivers to work substantially more than the full-time equivalent, generating higher monthly net earnings than low-skill or casual employment, despite comparable or lower hourly net earnings relative to these outside options. Drivers who exit platform work in India and Indonesia do so to take up better-paying full-time positions. In contrast, Kenyan drivers often exit involuntarily, returning to offline driving with adverse financial consequences. One-third of drivers across countries rely on platform work to supplement earnings during emergencies or slow work periods, suggesting that platform work may play an important role as a financial safety net."

That decision may ultimately increase pressure on global businesses to reduce their contributions to climate change.</p><h2>Multinationals put pressure on supply chains</h2><p>Multinational companies\u2019 efforts to reduce their climate impact puts pressure on their suppliers \u2013 meaning many more companies must take their climate impact into consideration.</p><p>For instance, U.S.-based Walmart operates over 10,000 stores across <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/about/location-facts\">19 countries</a> and is the largest single buyer of goods in the world. That means it faces a wide range of regulations, including tracking and reducing emissions from its suppliers. In 2017, it launched Project Gigaton, aiming to cut 1 gigaton of supply-chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Suppliers including Nestle, Unilever, Coca Cola, Samsung and Hanes helped the company <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/02/21/walmart-suppliers-lead-the-charge-help-deliver-project-gigaton-goal-more-than-six-years-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reach its target six years early</a> through practical measures such as boosting energy efficiency, redesigning packaging, and reducing food waste. <span>While the data is verified through internal quality controls co-developed with NGOs like the Environmental Defense Fund, analysts at </span><span><a href=\"https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CTA100-Walmart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Planet Tracker</a></span> note that these \u201cavoided\u201d emissions haven\u2019t yet stopped Walmart\u2019s absolute footprint from rising alongside its business growth.</p><p><span>In early 2025, this growth led Walmart to </span><span><a href=\"https://trellis.net/article/walmart-2025-esg-update/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>push back its interim deadlines</span></a></span> for two of its most ambitious emissions reduction targets.

Moreover<span>, </span>almost half of its electricity worldwide came from renewable energy in 2024, its emissions per unit of revenue fell, and it is still targeting zero emissions from its operations by 2040.</p><h2>There are profits to be made in clean tech</h2><p>In addition to facing pressure from buyers and governments, companies see profits to be made from investing in climate-friendly clean technology.</p><p>Since 2016, investments in clean energy have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/energy-environment/trump-renewable-energy-batteries.html\">outpaced that of fossil fuels</a> globally. This trend has only hastened, with nearly twice as much invested in clean energy as fossil fuels in 2025.</p><p></p><p>Lately, myriad <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00743-7\">new business opportunities</a> for multinational companies and start-ups alike have focused on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/amazon-sustainability-officers-ai-tool-climate-change/\">meeting AI\u2019s energy demand</a> through clean energy.</p><p>From 2014 to 2024, the climate tech sector yielded total <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/q1-2025/\">returns of nearly 200 percent</a> , and U.S. investment in climate tech was <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">still growing in 2025</a>.</p><p>In the first half of 2025, <a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NZI-State-of-Climate-Tech_H1-2025.pdf\">close to one-fifth</a> of the over 1,600 venture deals in climate tech were made by corporations for strategic reasons, such as technology access, supply chain integration, or future product offerings. <span>Corporate strategic deals continued to represent about </span><a href=\"https://stateofclimatetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NZI_2025-State-of-Climate-Tech-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>20 to 23 percent</span></a> of all climate tech equity transactions through the third and fourth quarters of 2025.</p><p><span>However, this surge in investment is more than a search for profit; it is a defensive necessity as the tech industry\u2019s growth begins to collide with its environmental limits.</span></p><h2>The AI energy paradox</h2><p><span>The rapid expansion of AI is forcing multinational companies to make explicit choices about their climate priorities. While tech leaders once relied on annual renewable credits to meet climate targets, the scale of the AI power boom is forcing more rigorous carbon accounting. Global data centers are </span><a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai\" target=\"_blank\"><span>projected</span></a> to consume more electricity than Japan by 2030, a shift that turns \u201cvoluntary\u201d climate investments into a core business requirement for securing 24/7 energy supplies.</p><p><span>In 2025, the tech giants\u2019 own reports revealed the scale of AI emissions. Microsoft\u2019s 2025 Environmental Sustainability Report revealed a 23.4 percent </span><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/29/environmental-sustainability-report/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>increase</span></a> in total emissions since its 2020 baseline. Similarly, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2025-environmental-report/\">emissions have climbed 51 percent since 2019</a>, with a 22 percent surge in Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions in 2024 alone. <span>Amazon\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2024-report\" target=\"_blank\"><span>2024 Sustainability Report</span></a> noted a 33 percent jump since 2019 driven by the construction of new data centers. Meta\u2019s <a href=\"https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2025-sustainability-report/\">supplier\u2019s emissions (99 percent of its total footprint) are being driven to new heights</a> by the \u201cembodied carbon\u201d of AI hardware.</p><p><span>While high costs might tempt some to cut corners, climate action could instead become a hedge against energy volatility. C</span>ompanies like Amazon and Google are securing reliable supply by leveraging <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/80-billion-us-nuclear-power\">federal fast-tracking of nuclear permits</a> to act as primary offtakers for the first generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). <span>This shift is accelerated by new federal orders to bypass nuclear licensing hurdles, as seen in Google\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/google-and-kairos-power-team-up-for-smr-deployments-in-us-first\" target=\"_blank\"><span>landmark agreement with Kairos Power</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/amazon-invests-in-x-energy-unveils-smr-project-plans\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Amazon\u2019s $500 million investment in X-energy</span></a><span>\u2014deals designed to secure the 24/7 \u201cbaseload\u201d power AI requires without abandoning carbon-free commitments. Despite their advanced designs, SMRs are still provoking </span><span></span>debate over their <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2111833119\" target=\"_blank\">radioactive waste</a> and the potential risks of deploying nuclear technology <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/25/2025-18633/regulatory-guide-emergency-response-planning-and-preparedness-for-nuclear-power-reactors\" target=\"_blank\">closer to populated industrial hubs</a>.</p><h2>Companies look to their customers and the future</h2><p>As climate risks grow alongside political headwinds, companies are facing both pushes toward and pulls away from protecting the planet from catastrophic effects. Oil and gas companies, for example, <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/oil-and-gas-investment-is-more-important-than-ever\">continue to invest</a> in new oil and gas development. However, they also forecast <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/sustainability-and-reports/global-outlook/all-energy-types-are-needed\">renewable energy growth accelerating</a> and are investing in clean tech.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6016/chapter/5709986/Consumer-Facing-and-Carbon-Intensive-Sectors-A\">corporate leaders I interviewed</a>, from tech companies like Intel to sporting goods and apparel companies like Adidas, talked about aligning sustainability efforts and initiatives across their business globally whenever possible. This proactive approach allows them to more seamlessly collect data and respond to pressures arising domestically and globally, minimizing the need for costly patchwork efforts later. Moreover, global businesses know they will continue to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/feliciajackson/2025/11/07/international-standards-could-turn-net-zero-into-common-practice/\">face demands</a> from their customers, investors and employees to be better stewards of the planet.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges</p><p><span>In a 2025 Getty Images </span><a href=\"http://reports.gettyimages.com/VisualGPS-Visualizing-Sustainability-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>survey</span></a> of over 5,000 consumers across 25 countries, more than 80 percent of respondents reported that they expect clear ESG guidelines from businesses. Furthermore, these consumers\u2014from Brazil, Australia and Japan to the UK and US\u2014are increasingly using GenAI-driven shopping assistants to filter for \u201cresponsible business\u201d practices.</p><p><span>U.S. market </span><a href=\"https://www.hartman-group.com/reports/274144747/sustainability-2025-do-consumers-care\" target=\"_blank\"><span>research</span></a> from the Hartman Group corroborates this trend<span>: 71 percent of surveyed food and beverage consumers consider environmental and social impacts in their purchasing decisions.

The divergence between federal deregulation in Washington and the rigid physical demands of the AI revolution has created a new era of corporate pragmatism. While some firms may use political shifts to \u201cgreenhush\u201d or delay abstract pledges, the world\u2019s largest corporations are finding that they cannot simply account away the massive energy and infrastructure requirements of the AI Age. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges. In this new landscape, the global businesses that thrive will be those that build carbon-free foundations, while responding to existing and future laws across the globe.</span></p><p><em>This article is adapted by the author from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2016, she decided to attend Lehigh, where she earned a full scholarship to its master\u2019s program in civil engineering.</p><h2>Moving abroad and working the rails</h2><p>Her master\u2019s thesis focused on investigating root causes of crack propagation, which threatens railroad safety.</p><p>Repeated wheel-rail loading causes microcracks, leading to metal fatigue, and residual stress results from specialized heating and cooling treatments during the manufacturing of steel rails. Cracks can develop beneath the rail\u2019s surface. Because they\u2019re invisible to the naked eye, such fractures are challenging to detect, Kizildemir says.</p><p>The project was done in collaboration with the U.S. <a href=\"https://railroads.dot.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Railroad Administration</a>\u2014part of the <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Transportation</a>\u2014which is looking to adjust technical standards and employ mitigation strategies.</p><p>Kizildemir and five colleagues designed and implemented testing protocols and physics-based simulations to detect cracks earlier and prevent their spread. Their research has given the Railroad Administration insights into structural defects that are being used to revise rail-building guidelines and inspection protocols. The administration published the <a href=\"https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/76534\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first phase</a> of the research in 2024.</p><p>After graduating in 2018, Kizildemir began a summer internship as a civil engineer at Thornton Tomasetti. She conducted computational modeling using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abaqus</a> software for rails subjected to repeated plastic deformation\u2014material that permanently changes shape when under excessive stress\u2014and presented her recommendations for improvement to the company\u2019s management.</p><p>During her internship, she worked with professors in different fields, including materials behavior and mechanical engineering. The experience, she says, inspired her to pursue a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh, continuing her research with the Railroad Administration. She earned her degree in 2023.</p><p>She loved the work and the team at Thornton Tomasetti so much, she says, that she applied to work at the company, where she is now a project engineer.</p><h2>From simulations to real-world applications</h2><p>Her work focuses on developing finite element models for critical infrastructure and extreme events.</p><p>Finite modeling breaks complex systems or topics into small elements connected together to numerically simulate real-world situations. She creates computational models of structures enduring realistic catastrophic events, such as a vehicle crashing into a building.</p><p>She uses simulations to understand how buildings react to attacks such as the one on 9/11, which, she says, is often used as an example of why such research is essential.</p><p>When starting a project, she and her team review building standards and try to identify new issues not yet covered by them. The team then adapts existing codes and standards, usually developed for well-understood hazards such as earthquakes, wind, and floods, to define simulation parameters.</p><p>When a new structure is being built, for example, it is not designed to withstand a truck crashing into it. But Kizildemir and her team want to know how the building would react should that happen. They simulate the environments and situations, and they make recommendations based on the results to reduce or eliminate risks of structural failure.</p><p>Mitigation suggestions include specific strategies to be implemented during project design and construction.</p><p>Simulations can be created for any infrastructure, Kizildemir says.</p><p>\u201cI love problems that force me to think differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to keep growing.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to live by Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s internal motto: \u201cWhen others say no, we say \u2018Here\u2019s how.\u2019\u201d</p><h2>Joining IEEE and getting more involved</h2><p>When Kizildemir first heard of IEEE, she assumed it was only for electrical engineers. But after learning how diverse and inclusive the organization is, she joined in 2024. She has since been elevated to a senior member and has become a volunteer. She joined the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMTEM014\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society</a>.</p><p>She chaired the conference tracks and IEEE-sponsored sessions at the 2024 <a href=\"https://event.asme.org/Joint-Rail-Conference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Rail Conference</a>, held in Columbia, S.C. She actively contributes to IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Collabratec platform</a> and has participated in panel review meetings for senior member elevation applications.</p><p>She\u2019s also a member of <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASME</a> and has been volunteering for it since 2023.</p><p>\u201cCommunity is what helped get me to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward and make the field better,\u201d she says. \u201cHelping others improves ourselves.\u201d</p><h2>Looking ahead and giving back</h2><p>Kizildemir mentors junior engineers at Thornton Thomasetti and is looking to expand her reach through <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/mentoring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE\u2019s mentorship programs</a>.</p><p>\u201cEngineering doesn\u2019t have a gender requirement,\u201d she says she tells girls. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious and like understanding how things work and get excited to solve difficult problems, engineering is for you.</p><p>\u201cCivil engineers don\u2019t just build bridges,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere are countless niche areas to be explored. Engineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.\u201d</p><p>Kizildemir says she wants every engineer to be able to improve their community. Her main piece of advice for recent engineering graduates is that \u201ccuriosity, discipline, and the willingness to understand things deeply, to see how things can be done better,\u201d are the keys to success.</p>"

For elderly or disabled drivers, those bulky cords can <a href=\"https://www.ridc.org.uk/transport/inaccessible-charging-barrier-electric-disabled-and-older-drivers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">be a physical challenge.</a></p><p>As it was for smartphones years ago, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-charging\" target=\"_self\">wireless EV charging</a> has been the dream. But there\u2019s a difference of nearly four orders of magnitude between the roughly 14 watt-hours of a typical smartphone battery and that of a large EV. That\u2019s what makes the wireless charging on the 108-kilowatt-hour pack in the forthcoming Porsche Cayenne Electric so notable.</p><p>To offer the first inductive charger on a production car, Porsche had to overcome both technical and practical challenges\u2014such as how to protect a beloved housecat prowling below your car. The German automaker demonstrated the system at September\u2019s <a href=\"https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2025/products/porsche-demonstrates-inductive-charging-at-iaa.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IAA Mobility</a> show in Munich.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>With its <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a65810736/2026-porsche-cayenne-electric-prototype-drive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-volt architecture</a>, the Cayenne Electric can charge at up to 400 kW at a public DC station, enough to fill its pack from 10 to 80 percent in about 16 minutes. The wireless system delivers about 11 kW for Level 2 charging at home, where Porsche says three out of four of its customers do nearly all their fill-ups. Pull the Cayenne into a garage and align it over a floor-mounted plate, and the SUV will charge from 10 to 80 percent in about 7.5 hours. No plugs, tangled cords, or dirty hands. Porsche will offer a single-phase, 48-ampere version for the United States after buyers see their first Cayennes in mid-2026, and a <a href=\"https://cc-techgroup.com/single-phase-vs-three-phase-power/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">three-phase</a>, 16-A system in Europe.</p><h2>Porsche\u2019s Wireless Charging is Based on an Old Concept</h2><p>The concept of inductive charging has been around for more than a century. Two coils of copper wire are positioned near one another. A current flowing through one coil creates a magnetic field, which induces voltage in the second coil.</p><p>In the Porsche system, the floor-mounted pad, 78 centimeters wide, plugs into the home\u2019s electrical panel. Inside the pad, which weighs 50 kilograms, grid electricity (at 60 hertz in the United States, 50 Hz in most of the rest of the world) is converted to DC and then to high-frequency AC at 2,000 V.The resulting <a href=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1493137\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">85-kilohertz</a> magnetic field extends from the pad to the Cayenne, where it is converted again to DC voltage.</p><p>The waterproof pad can also be placed outdoors, and the company says it\u2019s unaffected by leaves, snow, and the like. In fact, the air-cooled pad can get warm enough to melt any snow, reaching temperatures as high as 50 \u00b0C.</p><p>The Cayenne\u2019s onboard charging hardware mounts between its front electric motor and battery. The 15-kg induction unit wires directly into the battery.</p><p>In most EVs, plug-in (conductive) AC charging tops out at <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36062942/evs-explained-charging-losses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">around 95 percent</a> efficiency. Porsche says its wireless system delivers 90 percent efficiency, despite an air gap of roughly 12 to 18 cm between the pad and vehicle.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory transferred an impressive <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kilowatts</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency.</span></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re super proud that we\u2019re just below conductive AC in charging efficiency,\u201d says Simon Schulze, Porsche\u2019s product manager for charging hardware. Porsche also beats inductive phone chargers, which typically max out at about 70 percent efficiency, Schulze says.</p><p>When the car gets within 7.5 meters of the charging pad, the Cayenne\u2019s screen-based parking-assist system turns on automatically. Then comes a kind of video game that requires the driver to align a pair of green circles on-screen, one representing the car, the other the pad. It\u2019s like a digital version of the tennis ball some people hang in their garage to gauge parking distance. There\u2019s ample wiggle room, with tolerances of 20 cm left to right, and 15 cm fore and aft. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss it,\u201d according to Schulze.</p><p>Induction loops detect any objects between the charging plate and the vehicle; such objects, if they\u2019re metal, could heat up dangerously. Radar sensors detect any living things near the pad, and will halt the charging if necessary. People can walk near the car or hop aboard without affecting a charging session.</p><p>Christian Holler, Porsche\u2019s head of charging systems, says the system conforms to International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection standards for electromagnetic radiation. The field remains below 15 microteslas, so it\u2019s safe for <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/devices-that-may-interfere-with-icds-and-pacemakers\" target=\"_blank\">people with pacemakers</a>, Porsche insists. And the aforementioned cat wouldn\u2019t be harmed even if it strayed into the magnetic field, though \u201cits metal collar might get warm,\u201d Schulze says.</p><p>The Porsche system\u2019s 90 percent efficiency is impressive but not record-setting. Last year, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) transferred <a href=\"https://www.ornl.gov/news/polyphase-wireless-power-transfer-system-achieves-270-kilowatt-charge-sets-another-world\" target=\"_blank\">270 kW</a> to a Porsche Taycan with 95 percent efficiency, boosting its state of charge by 50 percent in 10 minutes. That <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-ev-charging-2668791896\" target=\"_self\">world-record wireless rate</a> relied on polyphase windings for coils, part of a U.S. Department of Energy project that was backed by Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company.</p><p>That effort, Holler says, spawned a Ph.D. paper from VW engineer <a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/9126/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Foote</a>. Yet the project had different goals from the one that led to the Cayenne charging system. ORNL was focused on maximum power transfer, regardless of cost, production feasibility, or reliability, he says.</p><p>By contrast, designing a system for showroom cars \u201crequires a completely different level of quality and processes,\u201d Holler says.</p><h2>High Cost Could Limit Adoption</h2><p> Cayenne buyers in Europe will pay around \u20ac7,000 (roughly US $8,100) for the optional charger. Porsche has yet to price it for the United States.</p><p> Loren McDonald, chief executive of Chargeonomics, an EV-charging analysis firm, said wireless charging \u201cis clearly the future,\u201d with use cases such as driverless robotaxis, curbside charging, or at any site \u201cwhere charging cables might be an annoyance or even a safety issue.\u201d</p><p>But for now, inductive charging\u2019s costly, low-volume status will limit it to niche models and high-income adopters, McDonald says. Public adoption will be critical \u201cso that drivers can convenience-charge throughout their driving day\u2014which then increases the benefits of spending more money on the system.\u201d</p><p>Porsche acknowledges that issue; the system conforms to wireless standards set by the Society of Automotive Engineers so that other automakers might help popularize the technology.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want this to be proprietary, a Porsche-only solution,\u201d Schulze says. \u201cWe only benefit if other brands use it.\u201d</p>"

And although it took decades to take hold in the modern office, it found novel uses in other fields.</p><h2>Who invented the Dictaphone?</h2><p>The Dictaphone was born from the competition and the cooperation of Bell and Edison and their capable teams of researchers. In 1877, Edison had introduced <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/edisons-phonograph\" target=\"_blank\">the phonograph</a>, which he later declared <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2022/03/thomas-edisons-favorite-invention-the-phonograph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his favorite invention</a>. And yet he wasn\u2019t quite certain about its commercial applications. Initially, he thought it might be good for recording telephone messages. Then he began to imagine other uses: a mechanical stenographer for businessmen, a notetaker for students, an elocution instructor, a talking book for the blind.

And after a few public demonstrations, he set aside the invention to pursue other interests.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an apparatus consisting of a metal cylinder on a metal rod with a handle, seated on a flat rectangular base. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b77c1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-an-apparatus-consisting-of-a-metal-cylinder-on-a-metal-rod-with-a-handle-seated-on-a-flat-rectangular.jpg?id=62563774&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Thomas Edison\u2019s early phonograph from 1877 used a needle to record sound waves on a rotating cylinder wrapped with tinfoil. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Thomas Edison National Historical Park/National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior</small></p><p>Enter Bell. In 1880, the French government had awarded Bell the Volta Prize and 50,000 francs (about US $10,000 at the time) for his invention of the telephone. The following year, he, his cousin Chichester A. Bell, and Charles Sumner Tainter used the prize money to found the Volta Laboratory Association in Washington, D.C., to do research on sound recording and transmission.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/particle-physics-resurrects-alexander-graham-bells-voice\" target=\"_self\">Particle Physics Resurrects Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s Voice</a></p><p>Tainter saw potential in the phonograph. Edison\u2019s version used a needle to etch sound waves on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a metal cylinder. The foil was easily damaged, the sound quality was distorted and squeaky, and the cylinder could be replayed only a few times before degrading and becoming inaudible. Edison\u2019s phonograph couldn\u2019t be easily commercialized, in other words.</p><p>Chichester Bell and Tainter greatly improved the sound quality by replacing the tinfoil with <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\" target=\"_blank\">wax-coated cardboard cylinders</a>.

As a \u201cdictator,\u201d you would speak into the tube, and a stylus would trace the sound wave on the wax cylinder. The cylinder would then be handed off to a secretary for transcription. Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary.</p><p>A manufacturing company set up by Volta Lab sold several machines to the U.S. government. One enthusiastic early adopter was Edward D. Easton, a noted stenographer for the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Easton took notes in shorthand, he immediately recited his notes into the Graphophone after each session.</p><p>Easton became an evangelist for the instrument, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Phonogram1_4/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">writing glowing accounts</a> in a trade magazine. The machine made no mistakes and could take dictation as fast as the speaker could articulate. The phonograph never complained when a transcriber needed a phrase repeated. The phonograph didn\u2019t suffer from poor penmanship. Anyone could learn to use the machine in two weeks or less, compared to months or years to master stenography. Such were Easton\u2019s claims. (Easton was such a fan that he cofounded the Columbia Phonograph Co., which went on to become a leading maker of phonographs and recorded music and lives on today as <a href=\"https://www.columbiarecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia Records</a>.)</p><p>Before long, several companies were manufacturing and selling phonographs and dictation machines. Even though demand was initially light, patent-infringement lawsuits sprang up, which soon threatened to bankrupt all of the companies involved. Finally, in 1896, the various parties agreed to stop fighting and to cross-license each other\u2019s intellectual property. This didn\u2019t end the Bell-Edison rivalry, but it allowed the phonograph business to take off in earnest, aided by the sales of mass-produced recorded music cylinders. And the accepted name for this entertainment machine became the phonograph.</p><h2>The Dictaphone Gets Down to Business</h2><p>But Bell, Tainter, and Edison didn\u2019t forget the original promise of mechanical stenography, and the rivals soon came out with competing and very similar products designed specifically for dictation: the Dictaphone and the Ediphone. The public found it difficult to distinguish the two products, and it wasn\u2019t long before \u201cdictaphone\u201d was being used to describe all dictation machines. (The Columbia Graphophone Co. trademarked \u201cDictaphone\u201d in 1907\u2014a confusing neologism of <em><em>dicta</em></em> from the Latin for \u201csayings\u201d or \u201csay repeatedly\u201d and <em><em>phone</em></em> from the Greek for \u201cvoice\u201d or \u201csound.\u201d)</p><p>As David Morton recounts in his 1999 book <em><em>Off the Record</em></em> (Rutgers University Press), Dictaphone sales accelerated as scientific management for business began to take root. Office managers intent on streamlining, standardizing, and systemizing workflows saw the Dictaphone as a labor-saving device. In 1912, for instance, an efficiency commission set up by U.S. President William Taft endorsed the use of dictation machines in government offices. The railroad and insurance industries followed suit as they standardized their financial records. Later, managers began using dictation machines to conquer their business correspondence.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an older man with a moustache holding a tube near his mouth.

The U.S. government was an early adopter of the machines.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Library of Congress</small></p><p>And yet, the Dictaphone wasn\u2019t obviously destined to become an indispensable piece of office equipment like the typewriter. In 1923, for instance, 15,000 dictation machines were sold in the United States, versus 744,000 typewriters.</p><p>In 1926, the Dictaphone Corp. tried to drum up interest by sponsoring Henry Lunn, founder of a large U.K. travel company, on an around-the-world lecture tour. At each hotel he visited, the company ensured there was a Dictaphone for Lunn to record his diary. Consider this a prototype for the modern hotel business center. At the end of his journey, Lunn published <em><em>Round the World With a Dictaphone</em></em>\u2014part travelogue, part proselytizing for Christian churches to support the League of Nations, and part Dictaphone promotion. Even so, by 1945, Dictaphone estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of the potential market had been captured.</p><p>There were social reasons working against dictation machines, Morton says in his book. Executives relied on their secretaries not only for dictation and transcription, but also for their often unacknowledged aid in prompting, correcting, and filling in their bosses\u2019 thoughts\u2014the soft skills that a machine could not replace.</p><p>Morton also attributes the slow uptake to the technology itself. One quirk of the Dictaphone is that it continued to use wax cylinders long after phonograph players had switched to discs. Transcribers often complained that the wax recordings were unintelligible\u2014dictators needed to speak directly into the speaking tube, loudly, clearly, and at an appropriate pace, but many did not.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman sitting at a manual typewriter and wearing headphones that connect to a machine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"df276\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-sitting-at-a-manual-typewriter-and-wearing-headphones-that-connect-to-a-machine.jpg?id=62564524&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A secretary plays back the sound from a recorded Ediphone cylinder in 1930 to transcribe the cylinder\u2019s contents.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Popperfoto/Getty Images</small></p><p>During World War II, Dictaphone finally ditched the wax cylinders in favor of etching grooves on a plastic belt, although the new machines were available only to U.S. government agencies until the end of the war. In 1947, the company publicly introduced the new technology with its Time-Master series. Each Dictabelt held about 15 minutes of recording. Meanwhile, Edison\u2019s Ediphone was rebranded the <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2016/09/15/take-a-memo/\" target=\"_blank\">Voicewriter</a> and recorded on distinctive red plastic discs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a rectangular device with a long cord and microphone and 3 reddish discs with a hole in the middle. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f63d1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-rectangular-device-with-a-long-cord-and-microphone-and-3-reddish-discs-with-a-hole-in-the-middle.jpg?id=62564655&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This 1953 Edison Voicewriter recorded the speaker\u2019s voice on plastic Diamond Discs. Magnetic tape came later.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian Design Museum/Smithsonian Institution</small></p><p>In the 1960s, Dictaphone finally embraced magnetic recording tape, in the form of cassette tapes. Pressure initially came from European companies, such as the Dutch electronics company Philips, which entered the U.S. market in 1958 with a low-priced tape-cartridge machine. Four years later, Philips introduced the Compact Cassette, which became the basis of today\u2019s audio cassette. Transistorized electronics furthered miniaturization and made dictation machines much more portable. Eventually, solid-state storage replaced magnetic tape, and today, we all carry around a dictation device with an effectively infinite recording time via cloud storage, and, if we choose to use it, automatic transcription.</p><h2>The Dictaphone in the Classroom</h2><p>None of the stories about businessmen using (or abusing) Dictaphones really surprised me. What did surprise me were the creative ways the Dictaphone was used as a pedagogical tool.</p><p>In 1924, for example, Dwight Everett Watkins at the University of California described in a paper how his students used a microphone, an amplifier, a telemegaphone (a type of speaker), and a Dictaphone to aid in public speaking. The setup helped students understand their rhetorical imperfections: bad grammar and bad sentence and paragraph structure. It also helped with elocution\u2014one of the early applications that Edison envisioned for his phonograph.</p><p>In 1933, George F. Meyer wrote about using the Dictaphone as an educational aid for blind and low-vision students in Minneapolis. Teachers recorded course material that would otherwise have had to be read aloud. And the students liked being able to listen to the material repeatedly without inconveniencing a human reader.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman seated to the left and typing on a typewriter, with a crowd of young women standing around her wearing headphones that connect to a machine at the typist\\u2019s side.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"568fe\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-seated-to-the-left-and-typing-on-a-typewriter-with-a-crowd-of-young-women-standing-around-her.jpg?id=62564721&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Students in 1930 listen to a Dictaphone recording, which the seated woman controls with foot pedals.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images</small></p><p>In 1938, Frances M. Freeman wrote her master\u2019s thesis on whether the Dictaphone could help typing students who were struggling to master the skill. Her study was supported by the Dictaphone Sales Corp., but unfortunately for the company, she concluded that using a Dictaphone offered no advantage in learning to type. She did find that the students in the Dictaphone group seemed more alert in class than students taught the traditional way.</p><p>That last finding was borne out in a 1964 experiment at Dunbar Elementary School in New Orleans, where the Dictaphone Corp. had outfitted an \u201celectronic classroom.\u201d The idea was to help reluctant students by fostering an environment where learning was fun. As Principal Beulah E. Brown related in an article about the experiment, she\u2019d first encountered a Dictaphone several years earlier while on sabbatical and immediately saw its pedagogical potential. The Dictaphone, Brown wrote, promised individually tailored educational experiences, allowing students to focus on specific challenges and freeing the teacher to have more personal interactions with each child. Testimonials from Warren Honore\u2019s fifth grade class attest to its success as an engaging technology.</p><h2>From the Dictaphone to Email to AI</h2><p>As a historian of technology, I loved learning that two heavyweights in the field, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/us/melvin-kranzberg-78-historian-of-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">Melvin Kranzberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Kuhn</a>, were both committed fans of the Dictaphone. I also enjoyed meditating on the role of the dictaphone and other technology as a mediator in the writing process.</p><p>My research turned up <a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/tolstoys-dictaphone\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Tolstoy\u2019s Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse</em></em></a> (Graywolf Press), a 1996 collection of essays edited by the literary critic <a href=\"https://agnionline.bu.edu/about/our-people/authors/sven-birkerts/\" target=\"_blank\">Sven Birkerts</a><em><em>. </em></em>The title comes from an anecdote about the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who refused the offer of a Dictaphone because it would be \u201ctoo dreadfully exciting\u201d and would distract him from his literary pursuits. To form the volume, Birkerts posed questions to his authors concerning the place of self and soul in a society being bombarded with new forms of communication\u2014namely, email and the internet.</p><p>Today, of course, our world is being shaped by AI, arguably an even bigger disrupter than email was in the 1990s or the Dictaphone was in the early 20th century. But then, technology is always trying to remake society, and the path it takes is never inevitable. Sometimes, when we\u2019re lucky, it is delightfully surprising.</p><p><em>Part of a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\">continuing series</a> looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></p><p><span><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2026 print issue as \u201cThis Machine Listened to \u2018Dictators.\u2019 \u201d</em></span></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>David Morton emailed me and suggested I write about the Dictaphone after hearing me <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1127295581\" target=\"_blank\">give a talk</a> about this series.

But technology failures and slow data transmission speeds lead to delays in response time, Merchant says. The increase in global flooding has intensified the need for more accurate and reliable methods.</p><p>Last year Merchant built what she says is a more effective way to track and collect data during floods: a small, inexpensive, standardized <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-small-satellites-are-providing-lowcost-access-to-space\" target=\"_self\">CubeSat</a> integrated with artificial intelligence.

The computer contains a machine learning algorithm\u2014written by Merchant using <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>\u2014that analyzes collected images to detect flooding.</p><p>The CubeSat takes a high-definition image of its surroundings every 2 minutes and transmits it to the laptop. The satellite transfers up to 1,500 images daily and stores them on a 16-gigabyte SD card.</p><p>The algorithm then analyzes patterns, including changes in the water\u2019s color and the image\u2019s pixel density. When the algorithm detects flooding, the device can alert emergency responders.</p><p>\u201cWhile many existing systems operate on multihour cycles, the CubeSat captures high-resolution images every 2 minutes,\u201d Merchant says. \u201cThe system can then trigger alerts that are delivered to first responders via SMS or email.\u201d</p><p>To test their system, Merchant and her team built a city model made of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwjL4_HW0cCRAxVrFq0GHXarIIMYACICCAEQDhoCcHY&amp;ae=2&amp;aspm=1&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgP_JBhD-ARIsANpEMxx_LTL2CYrt6MTNaTw8Uwg0GXh7c1ESvihyfeHZMrOlMY-05m2894waAtkUEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASZeRoZ0DibY4mwrXyIZ1uxKoD7jIr24jiM5BXPzI3uaV74Qppa7itfAyzOgipLKIx5Qre6poFdsa6658iv-4JqoGP5zQeasw2KoooZKxekagaKwFB4W4GxHUIEnPPoc4Xxq700XtH&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_35&amp;sig=AOD64_1PXiPwo6s4gyW40AvBebKK-dGkDw&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjiqOjW0cCRAxWMMDQIHdG9DwgQ0Qx6BAgPEAE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lego</a> blocks in an empty bathtub. They positioned the CubeSat over it, and it took images of the scene. They then added water and dirt to make it look more like a real flood. The CubeSat successfully transferred the images to the laptop, and the algorithm detected the flooding.</p><p>Out of 30 teams, the Satellite Sentinels placed third.</p><h2>Continuing her work at Accenture</h2><p>Merchant is continuing her research on flood-prevention technologies at <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a> in Richmond, Va., where she works remotely as a payload owner and designer for the company\u2019s CubeSat launch team.</p><p>After the MIT program ended, Merchant decided to scale her project. She reached out to her former mentor <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hudson-space\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Hudson</a>, the global technical lead in space cybersecurity at Accenture. He offered her an internship.</p><p>Merchant is working to make the transition from prototype to functional product but, she says, needs to overcome obstacles she encountered with her MIT project.</p><p>The main one was that the model struggled to detect flooding in variable conditions. It\u2019s because the CNN model needs context, she says. Without it, the model can misinterpret complex visual cues. To fix the issue, Merchant trained the algorithm to spot flooding by identifying colors in individual pixels.</p><p>Transmitting images using Bluetooth worked in her bathroom, but it isn\u2019t quite as useful when CubeSats are orbiting 700 kilometers above the ground.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve used a Bluetooth headset before, you know it disconnects the moment you walk away from the device it\u2019s connected to,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to work when the CubeSat constellation is in orbit.\u201d</p><p>She suggested the Accenture team switch to SubMiniature Version A (SMA) antennas.

But the bumpy conditions didn\u2019t thwart its mission: to wirelessly beam power down to receivers on the ground as it flew by.</span></p><p>The test flight marked the first time power has been beamed from a moving aircraft. It was conducted by the Ashburn, Virginia-based startup <a href=\"https://www.overviewenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview Energy</a>, which emerged from stealth mode in December by announcing the feat.</p><p>But the greater purpose of the flight was to demonstrate the feasibility of a much grander ambition: to beam power from space to Earth. Overview plans to launch satellites into geosynchronous orbit (GEO) to collect unfiltered solar energy where the sun never sets and then beam this abundance back to humanity. The solar energy would be transferred as near-infrared waves and received by existing solar panels on the ground.</p><p>The far-flung strategy, known as space-based solar power, has become the subject of both <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electromagnetic-waves\" target=\"_blank\">daydreaming</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-beaming\" target=\"_blank\">serious research</a> over the past decade. Caltech\u2019s Space Solar Power Project launched a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/space-based-solar-power\" target=\"_self\">demonstration mission</a> in 2023 that transferred power in space using microwaves. And terrestrial power beaming is coming along too. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in July 2025 set a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/darpa-optical-wireless-power\" target=\"_self\">new record for wirelessly transmitting power</a>: 800 watts over 8.6 kilometers for 30 seconds using a laser beam. </p><p>But until November, no one had actively beamed power from a moving platform to a ground receiver.<strong> </strong></p><h2>Wireless Power Beaming Goes Airborne</h2><p>Overview\u2019s test transferred only a sprinkling of power, but it did it with the same components and techniques that the company plans to send to space. \u201cNot only is it the first optical power beaming from a moving platform at any substantial range or power,\u201d says Overview CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-berte-90559554/\" target=\"_blank\">Marc Berte</a>, \u201cbut also it\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s really done a power beaming thing where it\u2019s all of the functional pieces all working together,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same methodology and function that we will take to space and scale up in the long term.\u201d</p><p>The approach was compelling enough that power beaming expert <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-jaffe-15594a1/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Jaffe</a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-jaffe-15594a1/\" target=\"_blank\"></a> left his job as a program manager at DARPA to join the company as head of systems engineering. Prior to DARPA, Jaffe spent three decades with the <a href=\"https://www.nrl.navy.mil/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Naval Research Laboratory</a>.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThis actually sounds like it could work,\u201d <strong>\u2013Paul Jaffe</strong></p><p>It was hearing Berte explain Overview\u2019s plan at a conference that helped to convince Jaffe to take a chance on the startup. \u201cThis actually sounds like it could work,\u201d Jaffe remembers thinking at the time. \u201cIt really seems like it gets around a lot of the showstoppers for a lot of the other concepts. I remember coming home and telling my wife that I almost felt like the problem had been solved. So I thought: Should [I] do something which is almost unheard of\u2014to leave in the middle of being a DARPA program manager\u2014to try to do something else?\u201d</p><p><span>For Jaffe, the most compelling reason was in Overview\u2019s solution for space-based solar\u2019s power density problem. A beam with low power density is safer because it\u2019s not blasting too much concentrated energy onto a single spot on the Earth\u2019s surface, but it\u2019s less efficient for the task of delivering usable solar energy. A higher-density beam does the job better, but then the researchers must engineer some way to maintain safety.</span></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Startup Overview Energy demonstrates how space-based solar power could be beamed to Earth from satellites</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Overview Energy</small></p><h2>Space-Based Solar Power Makes Waves</h2><p><span></span>Many researchers have settled on microwaves as their beam of choice for wireless power. But, in addition to the safety concerns about shooting such intense waves at the Earth, Jaffe says there\u2019s another problem: microwaves are part of what he calls the \u201cbeachfront property\u201d of the electromagnetic spectrum\u2014a range from 2 to 20 gigahertz that is set aside for many other applications, such as 5G cellular networks. </p><p>\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Jaffe says, \u201cif you somehow magically had a fully operational solar power satellite that used microwave power transmission in orbit today\u2014and a multi-kilometer-scale microwave power satellite receiver on the ground magically in place today\u2014you could not turn it on because the spectrum is not allocated to do this kind of transmission.\u201d</p><p>Instead, Overview plans to use less-dense, wide-field infrared waves. Existing utility-scale solar farms would be able to receive the beamed energy just like they receive the sun\u2019s energy during daylight hours. So \u201cyour receivers are already built,\u201d Berte says. The next major step is a prototype demonstrator for low Earth orbit, after which he hopes to have GEO satellites beaming megawatts of power by 2030 and gigawatts by later that decade.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/space-based-solar-power-2667878868\" target=\"_self\">Plenty of doubts</a> about the feasibility of space-based power abound. It is an exotic technology with much left to prove, including the ability to survive orbital debris and the exorbitant cost of launching the power stations. (Overview\u2019s satellite will be built on earth in a folded configuration and it will unfold after it\u2019s brought to orbit, according to the company). </p><p>\u201cGetting down the cost per unit mass for launch is a big deal,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cThen, it just becomes a question of increasing the specific power. A lot of the technologies we\u2019re working on at Overview are squarely focused on that.\u201d</p>"

These amplifiers are part of the facilities\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/alma/receiver-bands/\" target=\"_blank\">Band 2</a> coverage, ranging from 67 to 116 GHz on the electromagnetic spectrum.

In addition, scientists will be able to study planet-forming disks in better detail. Last, but certainly not least, they will be able to study complex organic molecules in nearby galaxies, which are considered precursors to the building blocks of life.

The new platform, set to reach customers later this year, is advertised to offer a ten-fold reduction in inference costs and a four-fold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to train certain models, as compared to Nvidia\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-blackwell\" target=\"_self\">Blackwell</a> architecture. </p><p>The usual suspect for improved performance is the GPU. Indeed, the new Rubin GPU boasts 50 quadrillion floating-point operations per second (petaFLOPS) of 4-bit computation, as compared to 10 petaflops on Blackwell, at least for transformer-based inference workloads like large language models.</p><p>However, focusing on just the GPU misses the bigger picture. There are a total of six new chips in the Vera-Rubin-based computers: the Vera CPU, the Rubin GPU, and four distinct networking chips. To achieve performance advantages, the components have to work in concert, says <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/author/giladshainer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gilad Shainer</a>, senior vice president of networking at Nvidia.</p><p>\u201cThe same unit connected in a different way will deliver a completely different level of performance,\u201d Shainer says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we call it extreme co-design.\u201d</p><h2>Expanded \u201cin-network compute\u201d</h2><p>AI workloads, both training and inference, run on large numbers of GPUs simultaneously. \u201cTwo years back, inferencing was mainly run on a single GPU, a single box, a single server,\u201d Shainer says. \u201cRight now, inferencing is becoming distributed, and it\u2019s not just in a rack. It\u2019s going to go across racks.\u201d</p><p>To accommodate these hugely distributed tasks, as many GPUs as possible need to effectively work as one. This is the aim of the so-called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rf-over-fiber\" target=\"_blank\">scale-up network</a>: the connection of GPUs within a single rack. Nvidia handles this connection with their NVLink networking chip. The new line includes the NVLink6 switch, with double the bandwidth of the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/\" target=\"_blank\">previous version</a><a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a> (3,600 gigabytes per second for GPU-to-GPU connections, as compared to 1,800 GB/s for NVLink5 switch).</p><p>In addition to the bandwidth doubling, the scale-up chips also include double the number of SerDes\u2014serializer/deserializers (which allow data to be sent across fewer wires) and an expanded number of calculations that can be done within the network.</p><p>\u201cThe scale-up network is not really the network itself,\u201d Shainer says. \u201cIt\u2019s computing infrastructure, and some of the computing operations are done on the network\u2026on the switch.\u201d</p><p>The rationale for offloading some operations from the GPUs to the network is two-fold. First, it allows some tasks to only be done once, rather than having every GPU having to perform them. A common example of this is the all-reduce operation in AI training. During training, each GPU computes a mathematical operation called a gradient on its own batch of data. In order to train the model correctly , all the GPUs need to know the average gradient computed across all batches. Rather than each GPU sending its gradient to every other GPU, and every one of them computing the average, it saves computational time and power for that operation to only happen once, within the network.</p><p>A second rationale is to hide the time it takes to shuttle data in-between GPUs by doing computations on them en-route. Shainer explains this via an analogy of a pizza parlor trying to speed up the time it takes to deliver an order. \u201cWhat can you do if you had more ovens or more workers? It doesn\u2019t help you; you can make more pizzas, but the time for a single pizza is going to stay the same. Alternatively, if you would take the oven and put it in a car, so I\u2019m going to bake the pizza while traveling to you, this is where I save time. This is what we do.\u201d</p><p>In-network computing is not new to this iteration of Nvidia\u2019s architecture. In fact, it has been in common use since around 2016. But, this iteration adds a broader swath of computations that can be done within the network to accommodate different workloads and different numerical formats, Shainer says.</p><h2>Scaling out and across</h2><p>The rest of the networking chips included in the Rubin architecture comprise the so-called scale-out network. This is the part that connects different racks to each other within the data center.</p><p>Those <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">chips</a> are the ConnectX-9, a networking interface card; the BlueField-4 a so-called data processing unit, which is paired with two Vera CPUs and a ConnectX-9 card for offloading networking, storage, and security tasks; and finally the Spectrum-6 Ethernet switch, which uses <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_self\">co-packaged optics</a> to send data between racks. The Ethernet switch also doubles the bandwidth of the previous generations, while minimizing jitter\u2014the variation in arrival times of information packets.</p><p>\u201cScale-out infrastructure needs to make sure that those GPUs can communicate well in order to run a distributed computing workload and that means I need a network that has no jitter in it,\u201d he says. The presence of jitter implies that if different racks are doing different parts of the calculation, the answer from each will arrive at different times. One rack will always be slower than the rest, and the rest of the racks, full of costly equipment, sit idle while waiting for that last packet. \u201cJitter means losing money,\u201d Shainer says.</p><p>None of Nvidia\u2019s host of new chips are specifically dedicated to connect between data centers, termed \u2018\u201cscale-across.\u201d But Shainer argues this is the next frontier. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop here, because we are seeing the demands to increase the number of GPUs in a data center,\u201d he says. \u201c100,000 GPUs is not enough anymore for some workloads, and now we need to connect multiple data centers together.\u201d</p>"

After two years of steady improvements, over the course of 2025, most of the core models reached a quality plateau, and more recently, seem to be in decline. A task that might have taken five hours assisted by AI, and perhaps 10 hours without it, is now more commonly taking seven or eight hours, or even longer. It\u2019s reached the point where I am sometimes going back and using older versions of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-language-model-performance\" target=\"_blank\">large language models</a> (LLMs).</span></p><p>I use LLM-generated code extensively in my role as CEO of <a href=\"https://www.carringtonlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carrington Labs</a>, a provider of predictive-analytics risk models for lenders. My team has a sandbox where we create, deploy, and run AI-generated code without a human in the loop. We use them to extract useful features for model construction, a natural-selection approach to feature development. This gives me a unique vantage point from which to evaluate coding assistants\u2019 performance.</p><h2>Newer models fail in insidious ways</h2><p>Until recently, the most common problem with AI coding assistants was poor syntax, followed closely by flawed logic. AI-created code would often fail with a syntax error or snarl itself up in faulty structure. This could be frustrating: The solution usually involved manually reviewing the code in detail and finding the mistake. But it was ultimately tractable.</p><p>However, recently released LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/gpt-5-trough-of-disillusionment\" target=\"_blank\">GPT-5</a>, have a much more insidious method of failure. They often generate code that fails to perform as intended, but which on the surface seems to run successfully, avoiding syntax errors or obvious crashes. It does this by removing safety checks, or by creating fake output that matches the desired format, or through a variety of other techniques to avoid crashing during execution.</p><p>As any developer will tell you, this kind of silent failure is far, far worse than a crash. Flawed outputs will often lurk undetected in code until they surface much later. This creates confusion and is far more difficult to catch and fix. This sort of behavior is so unhelpful that modern programming languages are deliberately designed to fail quickly and noisily.</p><h2>A simple test case</h2><p>I\u2019ve noticed this problem anecdotally over the past several months, but recently, I ran a simple yet systematic test to determine whether it was truly getting worse. I wrote some Python code, which loaded a dataframe, and then looked for a nonexistent column.</p><blockquote>df = pd.read_csv(\u2018data.csv\u2019)<br />df['new_column'] = df['index_value'] + 1 #there is no column \u2018index_value\u2019</blockquote><p>Obviously, this code would never run successfully. Python generates an easy-to-understand error message that explains that the column \u2018index_value\u2019 cannot be found. Any human seeing this message would inspect the dataframe and notice that the column was missing.</p><p>I sent this error message to nine different versions of ChatGPT, primarily variations on GPT-4 and the more recent GPT-5. I asked each of them to fix the error, specifying that I wanted completed code only, without commentary.</p><p>This is, of course, an impossible task\u2014the problem is the missing data, not the code. So the best answer would be either an outright refusal, or failing that, code that would help me debug the problem. I ran 10 trials for each model and classified the output as helpful (when it suggested the column is probably missing from the dataframe), useless (something like just restating my question), or counterproductive (for example, creating fake data to avoid an error).</p><p>GPT-4 gave a useful answer every one of the 10 times that I ran it. In three cases, it ignored my instructions to return only code, explained that the column was likely missing from my dataset, and that I would have to address it there. In six cases, it tried to execute the code but added an exception that would either throw up an error or fill the new column with an error message if the column couldn\u2019t be found (the 10th time, it simply restated my original code).</p><blockquote>This code will add 1 to the \u2018index_value\u2019 column from the dataframe \u2018df\u2019 if the column exists. If the column \u2018index_value\u2019 does not exist, it will print a message. Please make sure the \u2018index_value\u2019 column exists and its name is spelled correctly.\u201d,</blockquote><p>GPT-4.1 had an arguably even better solution. For nine of the 10 test cases, it simply printed the list of columns in the dataframe and included a comment in the code suggesting that I check to see if the column was present, and fix the issue if it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>GPT-5, by contrast, found a solution that worked every time: It simply took the actual index of each row (not the fictitious \u2018index_value\u2019) and added 1 to it in order to create new_column. This is the worst possible outcome: The code executes successfully, and at first glance seems to be doing the right thing, but the resulting value is essentially a random number. In a real-world example, this would create a much larger headache downstream in the code.</p><blockquote>df = pd.read_csv(\u2018data.csv\u2019)<br /><span>df['new_column'] = df.index + 1</span></blockquote><p>I wondered if this issue was particular to the gpt family of models. I didn\u2019t test every model in existence, but as a check, I repeated my experiment on Anthropic\u2019s Claude models. I found the same trend: The older Claude models, confronted with this unsolvable problem, essentially shrug their shoulders, while the newer models sometimes solve the problem and sometimes just sweep it under the rug.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A chart showing the fraction of responses that were helpful, unhelpful, or counterproductive for different versions of large language models. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5be57\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-showing-the-fraction-of-responses-that-were-helpful-unhelpful-or-counterproductive-for-different-versions-of-large-lan.jpg?id=62650386&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Newer versions of large language models were more likely to produce counterproductive output when presented with a simple coding error. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jamie Twiss</small></p><h2>Garbage in, garbage out</h2><p>I don\u2019t have inside knowledge on why the newer models fail in such a pernicious way. But I have an educated guess. I believe it\u2019s the result of how the LLMs are being trained to code. The older models were trained on code much the same way they were trained on other text. Large volumes of presumably functional code were ingested as training data, which was used to set model weights. This wasn\u2019t always perfect, as anyone using AI for coding in early 2023 will remember, with frequent syntax errors and faulty logic. But it certainly didn\u2019t rip out safety checks or find ways to create plausible but fake data, like GPT-5 in my example above.</p><p>But as soon as AI coding assistants arrived and were integrated into coding environments, the model creators realized they had a powerful source of labeled training data: the behavior of the users themselves. If an assistant offered up suggested code, the code ran successfully, and the user accepted the code, that was a positive signal, a sign that the assistant had gotten it right. If the user rejected the code, or if the code failed to run, that was a negative signal, and when the model was retrained, the assistant would be steered in a different direction.</p><p>This is a powerful idea, and no doubt contributed to the rapid improvement of AI coding assistants for a period of time. But as inexperienced coders started turning up in greater numbers, it also started to poison the training data. AI coding assistants that found ways to get their code accepted by users kept doing more of that, even if \u201cthat\u201d meant turning off safety checks and generating plausible but useless data. As long as a suggestion was taken on board, it was viewed as good, and downstream pain would be unlikely to be traced back to the source.</p><p>The most recent generation of AI coding assistants have taken this thinking even further, automating more and more of the coding process with autopilot-like features. These only accelerate the smoothing-out process, as there are fewer points where a human is likely to see code and realize that something isn\u2019t correct. Instead, the assistant is likely to keep iterating to try to get to a successful execution. In doing so, it is likely learning the wrong lessons.</p><p>I am a huge believer in artificial intelligence, and I believe that AI coding assistants have a valuable role to play in accelerating development and democratizing the process of software creation. But chasing short-term gains, and relying on cheap, abundant, but ultimately poor-quality training data is going to continue resulting in model outcomes that are worse than useless. To start making models better again, AI coding companies need to invest in high-quality data, perhaps even paying experts to label AI-generated code. Otherwise, the models will continue to produce garbage, be trained on that garbage, and thereby produce even more garbage, eating their own tails.</p>"

You\u2019re trying to follow a conversation across the table, but every word feels like it\u2019s wrapped in noise. For most people, these types of party scenarios, where it\u2019s difficult to filter out extraneous sounds and focus on a single source, are an occasional annoyance. For millions with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hearing-loss\" target=\"_blank\">hearing loss</a>, they\u2019re a daily challenge\u2014and not just in busy settings.</p><p>Today\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hearing-aids\" target=\"_blank\">hearing aids</a> aren\u2019t great at determining which sounds to amplify and which to ignore, and this often leaves users overwhelmed and fatigued. Even the routine act of conversing with a loved one during a car ride can be mentally draining, simply because the hum of the engine and road noises are magnified to create loud and constant background static that blurs speech.</p><p>In recent years, modern hearing aids have made impressive strides. They can, for example, use a technology called adaptive beamforming to focus their microphones in the direction of a talker. Noise-reduction settings also help decrease background cacophony, and some devices even use machine-learning-based analysis, trained on uploaded data, to detect certain environments\u2014for example a car or a party\u2014and deploy custom settings.</p><p>That\u2019s why I was initially surprised to find out that today\u2019s state-of-the-art hearing aids aren\u2019t good enough. \u201cIt\u2019s like my ears work but my brain is tired,\u201d I remember one elderly man complaining, frustrated with the inadequacy of his cutting-edge noise-suppression hearing aids. At the time, I was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas, surveying individuals with hearing loss. The man\u2019s insight led me to a realization: Mental strain is an unaddressed frontier of hearing technology.</p><p>But what if hearing aids were more than just amplifiers? What if they were listeners too? I envision a new generation of intelligent hearing aids that not only boost sound but also read the wearer\u2019s brain waves and other key physiological markers, enabling them to react accordingly to improve hearing and counter fatigue.</p><p>Until last spring, when I took time off to care for my child, I was a senior audio research scientist at <a href=\"https://www.harman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Harman International</a>, in Los Angeles. My work combined cognitive neuroscience, auditory prosthetics, and the processing of biosignals, which are measurable physiological cues that reflect our mental and physical state. I\u2019m passionate about developing brain-computer interfaces (<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/bci\" target=\"_blank\">BCIs</a>) and adaptive signal-processing systems that make life easier for people with hearing loss. And I\u2019m not alone. A number of researchers and companies are working to create smart hearing aids, and it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll come on the market within a decade.</p><p>Two technologies in particular are poised to revolutionize hearing aids, offering personalized, fatigue-free listening experiences: electroencephalography (EEG), which tracks brain activity, and pupillometry, which uses eye measurements to gauge cognitive effort. These approaches might even be used to improve consumer audio devices, transforming the way we listen everywhere.</p><h2>Aging Populations in a Noisy World<br /></h2><p>More than <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">430 million people</a> suffer from disabling hearing loss worldwide, including 34 million children, according to the World Health Organization. And the problem will likely get worse due to rising life expectancies and the fact that the world itself seems to be getting louder. By 2050, an estimated <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33714390/\" target=\"_blank\">2.5 billion people</a> will suffer some degree of hearing loss and 700 million will require intervention. On top of that, <a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/11/e010501\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">as many as 1.4 billion of today\u2019s young people</a>\u2014nearly half of those aged 12 to 34\u2014could be at risk of permanent hearing loss from listening to audio devices too loud and for too long.</p><p>Every year, close to a trillion dollars is lost globally due to unaddressed hearing loss, a trend that is also likely getting more pronounced. That doesn\u2019t account for the significant emotional and physical toll on the hearing impaired, including isolation, loneliness, depression, shame, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and loss of balance.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A back view of a man's head shows a flexible pattern of lines with electrodes inside that go over his ear and extend toward the front of his face.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"83e0c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-back-view-of-a-man-s-head-shows-a-flexible-pattern-of-lines-with-electrodes-inside-that-go-over-his-ear-and-extend-toward-the.jpg?id=62620547&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Flex-printed electrode arrays, such as these from the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology, offer a comfortable option for collecting high-quality EEG signals. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Leona Hofmann/Fraunhofer IDMT</small></p><p>And yet, despite widespread availability, hearing aid adoption remains low. According to a <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2823%2900232-5/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">2024 study</a> published in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>The Lancet</em></em>,</a> only about 13 percent of Americans adults with hearing loss regularly wear hearing aids. Key reasons for this deficiency include discomfort, stigma, cost\u2014and, crucially, frustration with the poor performance of hearing aids in noisy environments.</p><p>Historically, hearing technology has come a long way. As early as the 13th century, people began using horns of cows and rams as \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_trumpet\" target=\"_blank\">ear trumpets</a>.\u201d Commercial versions made of various materials, including brass and wood, came on the market in the early 19th century. (Beethoven, who famously began losing his hearing in his twenties, used variously shaped ear trumpets, some of which are now on display in a museum in Bonn, Germany.) But these contraptions were so bulky that users had to hold them with their hands or wear them within headbands. To avoid stigma, some even hid hearing aids inside furniture to mask their disability. In 1819, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-ouch-29896747\" target=\"_blank\">special acoustic chair</a> was designed for the king of Portugal, featuring arms ornately carved to look like open lion mouths, which helped transmit sound to the king\u2019s ear via speaking tubes.</p><p>Modern hearing aids came into being after the advent of electronics in the early 20th century. Early devices used vacuum tubes and then transistors to amplify sound, shrinking over time from bulky body-worn boxes to discreet units that fit behind or inside the ear. At their core, today\u2019s hearing aids still work on the same principle: A microphone picks up sound, a processor amplifies and shapes it to match the user\u2019s hearing loss, and a tiny speaker delivers the adjusted sound into the ear canal.</p><p>Today\u2019s best-in-class devices, like those from <a href=\"https://www.oticon.com/solutions/real-hearing-aids\" target=\"_blank\">Oticon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.phonak.com/en-us/hearing-devices/hearing-aids/audeo-lumity\" target=\"_blank\">Phonak</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.starkey.com/hearing-aids/genesis-artificial-intelligence-hearing-aids\" target=\"_blank\">Starkey</a>, have pioneered increasingly advanced technologies, including the aforementioned beamforming microphones, frequency lowering to better pick up high-pitched sounds and voices, and machine learning to recognize and adapt to specific environments. For example, the device may reduce amplification in a quiet room to avoid escalating background hums or else increase amplification in a noisy caf\u00e9 to make speech more intelligible.<strong> </strong></p><p>Advances in the AI technique of deep learning, which relies on artificial neural networks to automatically recognize patterns, also hold enormous promise. Using context-aware algorithms, this technology can, for example, be used to help distinguish between speech and noise, predict and suppress unwanted clamor in real time, and attempt to clean up speech that is muffled or distorted.</p><p>The problem? As of right now, consumer systems respond only to external acoustic environments and not to the internal cognitive state of the listener\u2014which means they act on imperfect and incomplete information. So, what if hearing aids were more empathetic? What if they could sense when the listener\u2019s brain feels tired or overwhelmed and automatically use that feedback to deploy advanced features?</p><h2>Using EEG to Augment Hearing Aids</h2><p>When it comes to creating intelligent hearing aids, there are two main challenges. The first is building convenient, power-efficient wearable devices that accurately detect brain states. The second, perhaps more difficult step is decoding feedback from the brain and using that information to help hearing aids adapt in real time to the listener\u2019s cognitive state and auditory experience.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/eeg\" target=\"_blank\">EEG</a>. This century-old noninvasive technology uses electrodes placed on the scalp to measure the brain\u2019s electrical activity through voltage fluctuations, which are recorded as \u201cbrain waves.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man with headphones sits in a lab in front of computers displaying information. Behind him through a doorway is seen another person sitting in front of a screen, wearing an EEG cap.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b6cbf\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-with-headphones-sits-in-a-lab-in-front-of-computers-displaying-information-behind-him-through-a-doorway-is-seen-another-p.jpg?id=62620561&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Brain-computer interfaces allow researchers to accurately determine a listener\u2019s focus in multitalker environments. Here, professor Christopher Smalt works on an attention-decoding system at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</small></p><p>Clinically, EEG has long been applied for diagnosing epilepsy and sleep disorders, monitoring brain injuries, assessing hearing ability in infants and impaired individuals, and more. And while standard EEG requires conductive gel and bulky headsets, we now have versions that are far more portable and convenient. These breakthroughs have already allowed EEG to migrate from hospitals into the consumer tech spaces, driving everything from neurofeedback headbands to the BCIs in gaming and wellness apps that allow people to control devices with their minds.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://uol.de/psychologie/abteilungen/ceegrid\" target=\"_blank\">cEEGrid project</a><strong> </strong>at Oldenburg University, in Germany, positions lightweight adhesive electrodes around the ear to create a low-profile version. In Denmark, <a href=\"https://ece.au.dk/en/research/research-centres/center-for-ear-eeg/\" target=\"_blank\">Aarhus University\u2019s Center for Ear-EEG</a> also has an ear-based EEG system designed for comfort and portability. While the signal-to-noise ratio is slightly lower compared to head-worn EEG, these ear-based systems have proven sufficiently accurate for gauging attention, listening effort, <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8006311\" target=\"_blank\">hearing thresholds</a>, and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ae00f3\" target=\"_blank\">speech tracking</a> in real time.</p><p>For hearing aids, EEG technology can pick up brain-wave patterns that reveal how well a listener is following speech: When listeners are paying attention, their brain rhythms synchronize with the syllabic rhythms of discourse, essentially tracking the speaker\u2019s cadence. By contrast, if the signal becomes weaker or less precise, it suggests the listener is struggling to comprehend and losing focus.</p><p>During my own <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.927872/full\" target=\"_blank\">Ph.D. research</a>, I observed firsthand how real-time brain-wave patterns, picked up by EEG, can reflect the quality of a listener\u2019s speech cognition. For example, when participants successfully homed in on a single talker in a crowded room, their neural rhythms aligned nearly perfectly with that speaker\u2019s voice. It was as if there were a brain-based spotlight on that speaker! But when background fracas grew louder or the listener\u2019s attention drifted, those patterns waned, revealing stress in keeping up.</p><p>Today, researchers at <a href=\"https://ece.au.dk/en/research/research-centres/center-for-ear-eeg/projects/investigation-of-auditory-responses-in-ear-eeg?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">Aarhus University</a>, <a href=\"https://uol.de/en/psychology/neurophysiology/forschung\" target=\"_blank\">Oldenburg University</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/partner-us/available-technologies/end-end-deep-neural-network-auditory-attention-decoding?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a> are developing attention-decoding algorithms specifically for auditory applications. For example, Oldenburg\u2019s cEEGrid technology has been used to <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aa66dd\" target=\"_blank\">successfully identify</a> which of two speakers a listener is trying to hear. In <span>a </span><a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/13/6/066004\" target=\"_blank\">related study</a><span>, researchers demonstrated that in-ear EEG can track the attended speech stream in multitalker environments.</span></p><p>All of this could prove transformational in creating neuroadaptive hearing aids. If a listener\u2019s EEG reveals a drop in speech tracking, the hearing aid could infer increased listening difficulty, even if ambient noise levels have remained constant. For example, if a hearing-impaired car driver can\u2019t focus on a conversation due to mental fatigue caused by background noise, the hearing aid could switch on beamforming to better augment the passenger\u2019s voice, as well as machine-learning settings to deploy sound canceling that blocks the din of the road.</p><p>Of course, there are several hurdles to cross before commercialization becomes possible. For one thing, EEG-paired hearing aids will need to handle the fact that neural responses differ from person to person, which means they will likely need to be calibrated individually to capture each user\u2019s unique brain-speech patterns.</p><p>Additionally, EEG signals are themselves notoriously \u201cnoisy,\u201d especially in real-world environments. Luckily, we already have algorithms and processing tools for cleaning and organizing these signals so computer models can search for key patterns that predict mental states, including attention drift and fatigue.</p><p>Commercial versions of EEG-paired hearing aids will also need to be small and energy-efficient when it comes to signal processing and real-time computation. And getting them to work reliably, despite head movement and daily activity, will be no small feat. Importantly, companies will need to resolve ethical and regulatory considerations, such as data ownership. To me, these challenges seem surmountable, especially with technology progressing at a rapid clip.</p><h2>A Window to the Brain: Using Our Eyes to Hear</h2><p><span>Now let\u2019s consider a second way of reading brain states: through the listener\u2019s eyes.</span></p><p>When a person has trouble hearing and starts feeling overwhelmed, the body reacts. Heart-rate variability diminishes, indicating stress, and sweating increases. Researchers are investigating how these types of autonomic nervous-system responses can be measured and used to create smart hearing aids. For the purposes of this article, I will focus on a response that seems especially promising\u2014namely, pupil size.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillometry\" target=\"_blank\">Pupillometry</a> is the measurement of pupil size and how it changes in response to stimuli. We all know that pupils expand or contract depending on light brightness. As it turns out, pupil size is also an accurate means of evaluating attention, arousal, mental strain\u2014and, crucially, listening effort.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Three eye illustrations showing pupil size changes due to light and emotional stimuli.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8c8bd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-eye-illustrations-showing-pupil-size-changes-due-to-light-and-emotional-stimuli.png?id=62712190&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Pupil size is determined by both external stimuli, such as light, and internal stimuli, such as fatigue or excitement.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Chris Philpot</small></p><p>In recent years, studies at <a href=\"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10173304/1/4856.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">University College London</a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29435963/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden University</a>, in the Netherlands,<strong> </strong>have demonstrated that pupil dilation is consistently greater in hearing-impaired individuals when processing speech in noisy conditions. Research has also shown pupillometry to be a sensitive, objective correlate of speech intelligibility and mental strain. It could therefore offer a<strong> </strong>feedback<strong> </strong>mechanism<strong> </strong>for user-aware hearing aids that dynamically adjust amplification strategies, directional focus, or noise reduction based not just on the acoustic environment but on how hard the user is working to comprehend speech.</p><p>While more straightforward than EEG, pupillometry presents its own engineering challenges. Pupillometry requires a direct line of sight to the pupil, necessitating a stable, front-facing camera-to-eye configuration\u2014which isn\u2019t easy to achieve when a wearer is moving around in real-world settings. On top of that, most pupil-tracking systems require infrared illumination and high-resolution optical cameras, which are too bulky and power intensive for the tiny housings of in-ear or behind-the-ear hearing aids. All this makes it unlikely that standalone hearing aids will include pupil-tracking hardware in the near future.</p><p>A more viable approach may be pairing hearing aids with smart glasses or other wearables that contain the necessary eye-tracking hardware. Products from companies like <a href=\"https://www.tobii.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tobii</a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://pupil-labs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pupil Labs</a> already offer real-time pupillometry via lightweight headgear for use in research, behavioral analysis, and assistive technology for people with medical conditions that limit movement but leave eye control intact. Apple\u2019s Vision Pro<strong> </strong>and other augmented reality or virtual reality platforms also include built-in eye-tracking sensors that could support pupillometry-driven adaptations for audio content.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A woman wears a pair of specialized glasses that have small cameras and infrared illuminators around edges of the glass for eye tracking, as well as a camera and microphone above the nose bridge.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"061a4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-wears-a-pair-of-specialized-glasses-that-have-small-cameras-and-infrared-illuminators-around-edges-of-the-glass-for-eye.jpg?id=62620574&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Smart glasses that measure pupil size, such as these made by Tobii, could help determine listening strain. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Tobii</small></p><p>Once pupil data is acquired, the next step will be real-time interpretation. Here, again, is where machine learning can use large datasets to detect patterns signifying increased cognitive load or attentional shifts. For instance, if a listener\u2019s pupils dilate unnaturally during a conversation, signifying strain, the hearing aid could automatically engage a more aggressive noise suppression mode or narrow its directional microphone beam. These types of systems can also learn from contextual features, such as time of day or prior environments, to continuously refine their response strategies.</p><p>While no commercial hearing aid currently integrates pupillometry, adjacent industries are moving quickly.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://emteqlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emteq Labs</a> is developing \u201cemotion-sensing\u201d glasses that combine facial and eye tracking, along with pupil measurement, to do things like evaluate mental health and capture consumer insights. Ethical controversies aside\u2014just imagine what dystopian governments might do with emotion-reading eyewear!\u2014such devices show that it\u2019s feasible to embed biosignal monitoring in consumer-grade smart glasses.</p><h2>A Future with Empathetic Hearing Aids</h2><p>Back at the dinner party, it remains nearly impossible to participate in conversation. \u201cWhy even bother going out?\u201d some ask. But that will soon change.</p><p>We\u2019re at the cusp of a paradigm shift in auditory technology, from device-centered to user-centered innovation. In the next five years, we may see hybrid solutions where EEG-enabled earbuds work in tandem with smart glasses. In 10 years, fully integrated biosignal-driven hearing aids could become the standard. And in 50? Perhaps audio systems will evolve into cognitive companions, devices that adjust, advise, and align with our mental state.</p><p>Personalizing hearing-assistance technology isn\u2019t just about improving clarity; it\u2019s also about easing mental fatigue, reducing social isolation, and empowering people to engage confidently with the world. Ultimately, it\u2019s about restoring dignity, connection, and joy. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

More than half of all upcoming global data centers\u2014as indicated by land purchased for data centers not yet announced, those under construction, and those whose plans are public\u2014will be developed in the United States.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26169918/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p>And these figures are likely underselling the near-term data-center dominance of the United States. Power usage varies widely among data centers, depending on land availability and whether the facility will provide x<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling</a> or mixed-use services, says <a href=\"https://eea.epri.com/research-staff.html#W\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Wilson</a>, who studies energy systems at the <a href=\"https://www.epri.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Electric Power Research Institute</a>. Because of these factors, \u201cdata centers in the U.S. are much larger on average than data centers in other countries,\u201d he says.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Wilson adds that the dataset you see here\u2014which comes from the analysis firm <a href=\"https://www.datacentermap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Center Map</a>\u2014may undercount new Chinese data centers because they are often not announced publicly. Chinese data-center plans are \u201cjust not in the repository of information used to collect data on other parts of the world,\u201d he says. If information about China were up-to-date, he would still expect to see \u201cthe U.S. ahead, China somewhat behind, and then the rest of the world trailing.\u201d</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26169973/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p>One thing that worries Wilson is whether the U.S. power grid can meet the rising energy demands of these data centers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy\" target=\"_blank\">flat demand for basically two decades</a>, and now we want to grow. It\u2019s a big system to grow,\u201d he notes.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\"><noscript><img alt=\"chart visualization\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26365676/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" /></noscript></div></div><p>He thinks the best solution is asking data centers to be more flexible in their power use, maybe by scheduling complex computation for off-peak times or maintaining on-site batteries, removing part of the burden from the power grid. Whether such measures will be enough to keep up with demand remains an open question.</p>"
