While individual firms weigh the risks to their own profits, they disregard the negative impact on other US firms and the broader economy, resulting in an over-investment that may reduce the US welfare. In our empirical analysis, industries with more joint ventures in China show positive spillovers to Chinese firms but negative outcomes for firms in the US. We develop a two-country model with oligopolistic competition, innovation, and joint ventures. For the US, the short-run gains from joint ventures are outweighed by long-run losses due to rising Chinese competition. Joint ventures benefit large US firms at the expense of small firms and the real wages of workers. A ban on joint ventures since 1999 would have boosted US welfare by 1.2 percent."

We argue conventional measures understate manufacturing productivity growth by failing to fully capture quality improvements. We compare consumer to producer and import price indices. In rapidly changing industries, consumer price indices indicate less inflation, suggesting mismeasurement in standard industry deflators. Using an input-output framework, we estimate that TFP growth is understated by 1.7 percentage points in durable manufacturing and 0.4 percentage points in nondurable manufacturing, with no mismeasurement in nonmanufacturing industries."

We estimate academic labor-supply elasticities and skill technology. Productivity and motivation are uncorrelated. Low productivity, not low motivation, is the stronger predictor of academic struggles. School quality augments productivity and accelerates skill production. We find that dynamic skill complementarities arise mainly from children\u2019s aging and from a feedback loop between investment activity and productivity, rather than from carrying forward past skill stocks."

Neither money nor supply shocks offer a coherent alternative explanation. Inflation eased, with no recession, once the fiscal shock was over. Higher interest rates could have brought inflation down earlier, but could not have stopped it. Going forward, higher interest rates will raise debt service costs, and thus perversely raise inflation unless fiscal policy can tighten. High debt and structural deficits also mean that the US may lose the fiscal space to borrow in the next crisis."

        "summary": "This paper examines when and why entrepreneurs choose to standardise their ventures and make themselves replaceable, extending Rajan's (2012) analysis within a property rights framework. A model is developed where entrepreneurs face finite pools of potential replacements and may remain with their ventures post-IPO, rather than retiring as in Rajan's setting. The analysis yields two main results. First, when worker effort is fully contractible, entrepreneurs never choose to standardise, preferring to remain irreplaceable to maximise their bargaining power. Second, when key workers exert non-contractible effort that affects firm value, standardisation becomes beneficial as it motivates worker performance while managing the entrepreneur's replaceability. The optimal level of standardisation increases with the entrepreneur's equity stake, creating a ``dead zone\" where entrepreneurs retain control but will not sell to outsiders. I extend the model to allow replacement of both entrepreneurs and workers, showing that standardisation can serve to reduce the bargaining power of all participants. The findings provide testable predictions about the relationship between equity structures, replacement market depth, and organisational design choices, while highlighting the strategic trade-offs entrepreneurs face between maintaining founder-specific advantages and creating transferable value for investors."

        "summary": "We use administrative security-level data from the U.S. and Euro Area (EA) portfolios to estimate asset demand and supply elasticities by exploiting exogenous variation in bond-specific currency wedges. Employing a Bartik-style shift-share identification approach, we document extensive heterogeneity in investor demand responsiveness to exogenous changes in the price of currency risk, conditional on the issuer characteristics. Demand for AE-bonds is always inelastic, whereas for EM-bonds, elasticity depends on investor type and currency: insurance/pension, nonbanks and banks have finite-elastic demand for EM-bonds that are issued in their own (investor) currency. For EM-issuer-currency bonds, only EA non-bank investors increase the share of these bonds in their portfolio when currency wedges widen, suggesting they accept higher currency risk for higher returns. In response, issuers adjust their supply endogenously: an exogenous increase of 8 basis point in currency wedges leads to a 0.26% decline in local currency bond issuance relative to GDP. We develop a theoretical framework where debt issuance decisions take into account heterogenous demand of investors in terms of their response to changes in the price of currency risk."

        "summary": "When estimating a production function, economists usually assume that firms fully employ all their available inputs. Contrary to this assumption, we document that underemployment of quasi-fixed inputs or low capacity utilization rates (CUR) is common across firms, especially in poor countries. Low CURs are correlated with supply-side constraints such as shortages of material inputs and electricity; they are also correlated with demand-side constraints such as a lack of access to markets. We show that when firms underemploy their quasi-fixed inputs, the assumptions behind standard production function estimation techniques-such as the control function approach-are invalid, and these techniques produce biased estimates of TFP. We demonstrate this using unique panel data from Ethiopia with information on actual and full capacity input demand. We find that measures of TFP that do not account for CUR considerably underestimate \u2019true\u2019 productivity when CUR is low but not when CUR is high. This leads to an exaggeration of the TFP gap between rich and poor countries."

        "summary": "This paper revisits the relationship between international trade, trade policy, and development in light of the structural, policy, and geopolitical shifts that have transformed globalization over the past decade. While trade has historically supported development through both static and dynamic channels, we argue that the latter\u2014those inducing structural transformation and institutional change\u2014have been far more consequential for long-run development. Through access to global markets, participation in global value chains, and knowledge and technology transfers, and by providing an anchor for reform, trade and trade agreements have contributed to productivity gains, technological progress, quality and skill upgrading, and institutional change in many low- and middle-income countries. Yet, the conditions that enabled these effects\u2014technologically driven declines in transportation and communication costs, fragmentation of the production process, liberal trade regimes, multilateralism and geopolitical stability\u2014are changing. Automation, digitization, climate change, the return of industrial policy in advanced economies, and the rise of geopolitical rivalry are reshaping the global trade environment. In this new context, the scope for replicating past export-led growth successes is unlikely as two key growth mechanisms, access to the lucrative markets of advanced economies and knowledge sharing, are under threat. We discuss whether trade in services and the green transition may offer new opportunities, emphasizing that future prospects will depend on policy choices in large economies and the adaptability of developing countries."

On top of that, we have no means of measuring vacuums that low.</p><p>At least, not yet.</p><p>Researchers are now developing a new vacuum-measurement tool that may be able to detect lower densities than any existing techniques can. This new quantum sensor uses individual atoms, cooled to just shy of absolute zero, to serve as targets for stray particles to hit.

By eliminating the need for calibration and serving as a primary standard, this atom-based approach doesn\u2019t just measure the farthest edges of the density spectrum\u2014it could become the very ruler by which all other vacuum measurements are compared.</p><h2>Vacuum measurement on Earth</h2><p>While humans haven\u2019t yet succeeded in making vacuum as pure as it is in deep space, many earthly applications still require some level of emptiness. Semiconductor manufacturing, large physics experiments in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-hadron-collider-starts-up\" target=\"_blank\">particle</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/black-holes-bumping-in-the-light-ligo-hears-gravitational-waves-with-increasing-sensitivity\" target=\"_blank\">wave detection</a>, some <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-network-interface\" target=\"_self\">quantum-computing platforms</a>, and surface-analysis tools, including <a href=\"https://sustainable-nano.com/2017/07/26/x-ray-photoelectron-spectroscopy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</a>, all require so-called ultrahigh vacuum.</p><p>At these low levels of particles per unit volume, vacuum is parameterized by pressure, measured in pascals. Regular atmospheric pressure is 10<span><sup>5</sup></span> Pa. Ultrahigh vacuum is considered to be anything less than about 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Some applications require as low as 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa. The deepest depths of space still hold the nothingness record, reaching below 10<span><sup>-20</sup></span> Pa.</p><p>The method of choice for measuring pressure in the ultrahigh vacuum regime is the ionization gauge. \u201cThey work by a fairly straightforward mechanism that dates back to vacuum tubes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/stephen-eckel\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Eckel</a>, a member of the cold-atom vacuum-measurement team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"red light shining from a circular window in a metal vacuum chamber. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4bd3f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/red-light-shining-from-a-circular-window-in-a-metal-vacuum-chamber.png?id=61612440&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A portable cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool [top] detects the fluorescence of roughly 1 million lithium atoms [bottom], and infers the vacuum pressure based on how quickly the fluorescence decays. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Photos: Jayme Thornton</small></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"small dot of red light in the middle of a circular window. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09866\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/small-dot-of-red-light-in-the-middle-of-a-circular-window.png?id=61609895&amp;width=980\" /></p><p>Indeed, an ionization gauge has the same basic components as a vacuum tube. The gauge contains a heated filament that emits electrons into the chamber. The electrons are accelerated toward a positively charged grid. En route to the grid, the electrons occasionally collide with atoms and molecules flying around in the vacuum, knocking off their electrons and creating positively charged ions. These ions are then collected by a negatively charged electrode. The current generated by these positive ions is proportional to the number of atoms floating about in the vacuum, giving a pressure reading.</p><p>Ion gauges are relatively cheap (under US $1,000) and commonplace. However, they come with a few difficulties. First, although the current in the ion gauge is proportional to the pressure in the chamber, that proportionality constant depends on a lot of fine details, such as the precise geometry of the filament and the grid. The current cannot be easily calculated from the electrical and physical characteristics of the setup\u2014ion gauges require thorough calibrations. \u201cA full calibration run on the ion gauges is like a full month of somebody\u2019s time,\u201d says<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/people/daniel-barker\" target=\"_blank\"> Daniel Barker</a>, a physicist at NIST who\u2019s also working on the cold-atom vacuum-measurement project.</p><p>Second, the calibration services provided by NIST (among others) calibrate down to only 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa. Performance below that pressure is questionable, even for a well-calibrated gauge. What\u2019s more, at lower pressures, the heat from the ion gauge becomes a problem: Hotter surfaces emit atoms in a process called outgassing, which pollutes the vacuum. \u201cIf you\u2019re shooting for a vacuum chamber with really low pressures,\u201d Madison says, \u201cthese ionization gauges actually work against you, and many people turn them off.\u201d</p><p>Third, the reading on the ion gauge depends very strongly on the types of atoms or molecules present in the vacuum. Different types of atoms could produce readings that vary by up to a factor of four. This variance is fine if you know exactly what\u2019s inside your vacuum chamber, or if you don\u2019t need that precise a measurement. But for certain applications, especially in research settings, these concerns are significant.</p><h2>How a cold-atom vacuum standard works</h2><p>The idea of a cold-atom vacuum-measurement tool developed as a surprising side effect of the study of cold atoms. Scientists first started cooling atoms down in an effort to make better atomic clocks back in the 1970s. Since then, cooling atoms and trapping them has become a cottage industry, giving rise to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-atomic-clocks\" target=\"_self\">optical atomic clocks</a>, atomic <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/accelerometer-quantum-bose-einstein\" target=\"_self\">navigation systems</a>, and neutral-atom quantum computers.</p><p>These experiments have to be done in a vacuum, to prevent the surrounding environment from heating the atoms. For decades, the vacuum was thought of as merely a finicky factor to be implemented as well as possible. \u201cVacuum limitations on atom traps have been known since the dawn of atom traps,\u201d Eckel says. Atoms flying around the vacuum chamber would collide with the cooled atoms and knock them out of their trap, leading to loss. The better the vacuum, the slower that process would go.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A glass cylinder with a coil inside it on a gray background. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b512d\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-glass-cylinder-with-a-coil-inside-it-on-a-gray-background.png?id=61609862&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The most common vacuum-measurement tool in the high-vacuum range today is the ion gauge, basically a vacuum tube in reverse: A hot filament emits electrons that fly toward a positively charged grid, ionizing background atoms and molecules along the way. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p>UBC\u2019s Kirk Madison and his collaborator <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-booth-57a28b12/?originalSubdomain=ca\" target=\"_blank\">James Booth</a> (then at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, in Burnaby), were among the first to turn that thinking on its <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.80.022712\" target=\"_blank\">head</a> back in the 2000s. Instead of battling the vacuum to preserve the trapped atoms, they thought, why not use the trapped atoms as a <a href=\"https://patents.justia.com/patent/8803072\" target=\"_blank\">sensor</a> to measure how empty the vacuum is?<p>To understand how they did that, consider a typical cold-atom vacuum-measurement device. Its main component is a vacuum chamber filled with a vapor of a particular atomic species. Some experiments use rubidium, while others use lithium. Let\u2019s call it lithium between friends.</p><p>A tiny amount of lithium gas is introduced into the vacuum, and some of it is captured in a magneto-optical trap. The trap consists of a magnetic field with zero intensity at the center of the trap, increasing gradually away from the center. Six laser beams point toward the center from above, below, the left, the right, the front, and the back. The magnetic and laser forces are arranged so that any lithium atom that might otherwise fly away from the center is most likely to absorb a photon from the lasers, getting a momentum kick back into the trap.</p><p>The trap is quite shallow, meaning that hot atoms\u2014above 1 kelvin or so\u2014will not be captured. So the result is a small, confined cloud of really cold atoms, at the center of the trap. Because the atoms absorb laser light occasionally to keep them in the trap, they also reemit light, creating fluorescence. Measuring this fluorescence allows scientists to calculate how many atoms are in the trap.</p><p>To use this setup to measure vacuum, you load the atoms into the magneto-optical trap and measure the fluorescence. Then, you turn off the light and hold the atoms in just the magnetic field. During this time, background atoms in the vacuum will chance upon the trapped atoms, knocking them out. After a little while, you turn the light back on and check how much the fluorescence has decreased. This measures how many atoms got knocked out, and therefore how many collisions occurred.</p><p>The reason you need the trap to be so shallow and the atoms to be so cold is that these collisions are very weak. \u201cA few collisions are quite energetic, but most of the background gas particles fly by and, like, whisper to the trapped atom, and it just gently moves away,\u201d Madison says.</p><p>This method has several advantages over the traditional ion-gauge measurement. The atomic method does not need calibration; the rate at which fluorescence dims depending on the vacuum pressure can be calculated accurately. These calculations are involved, but in a paper published in 2023 the NIST team <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article/5/3/035001/2905161/Accurate-measurement-of-the-loss-rate-of-cold\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated</a> that the latest method of calculation shows excellent agreement with their experiment. Because this technique does not require calibration, it can serve as a primary standard for vacuum pressure, and even potentially be used to calibrate ion gauges.</p><p>The cold-atom measurement is also much less finicky when it comes to the actual contents of the vacuum. Whether the vacuum is contaminated with helium or plutonium, the measured pressure will vary by perhaps only a few percent, while the ion gauge sensitivity and reading for these particles might differ by an order of magnitude, Eckel says.</p><p>Cold atoms could also potentially measure much lower vacuum pressures than ion gauges can. The current lowest pressure they\u2019ve reliably measured is around 10<span><sup>-9</sup></span> Pa, and NIST scientists are working on figuring out what the lower boundary might be. \u201cWe honestly don\u2019t know what the lower limit is, and we\u2019re still exploring that question,\u201d Eckel says.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"A chart of vacuum pressures in the universe\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b1f21\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-of-vacuum-pressures-in-the-universe.png?id=61612598&amp;width=980\" /><p class=\"caption\">No vacuum is completely empty. The degree to which vacuum pressure approaches pure nothingness is measured in pascals, with Earth\u2019s atmosphere clocking in at 10<sup>5</sup> Pa and intergalactic space at a measly 10<sup>-20</sup>.

It struggles at higher pressure, above 10<span><sup>-7</sup></span> Pa, so its applications are confined to the ultrahigh vacuum range. And, although there are no commercial atomic vacuum sensors available yet, they are likely to be much more expensive than ion gauges, at least to start.</p><p>That said, there are many applications where these devices could unlock new possibilities. At large science experiments, including LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and ones at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), well-placed cold-atom vacuum sensors could measure the vacuum pressure and also help determine where a potential leak might be coming from.</p><p>In semiconductor development, a particularly promising application is molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). MBE is used to produce the few, highly pure semiconductor layers used in laser diodes and devices for high-frequency electronics and quantum technologies. The technique functions in ultrahigh vacuum, with pure elements in separate containers heated on one end of the vacuum. The elements travel across the vacuum until they hit the target surface, where they grow one layer at a time.</p><p>Precisely controlling the proportion of the ingredient elements is essential to the success of MBE. Normally, this requires a lot of trial and error, building up thin films and checking whether the proportions are correct, then adjusting as needed. With a cold-atom vacuum sensor, the quantity of each element emitted into the vacuum can be detected on the fly, greatly speeding up the process.</p><p>\u201cIf this technique could be used in molecular-beam epitaxy or other ultrahigh vacuum environments, I think it will really benefit materials development,\u201d says <a href=\"https://qmi.ubc.ca/team-member/ke-zou/\" target=\"_blank\">Ke Zou</a>, an assistant professor of physics at UBC who studies molecular-beam epitaxy. In these high-tech industries, researchers may find that the ability to measure nothing is everything. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Direct comparisons are difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re building alien beings,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/hinton/facts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">won a Nobel Prize</a> for his work on AI.</p><p>Undaunted researchers are busy designing and proposing tests that might lend some insight into our future. But a question remains: Can these tests tell us if we\u2019ve achieved the long-sought goal of AGI?</p><h2>Why It\u2019s So Hard to Test for Intelligence</h2><p>There are infinite kinds of intelligence, even in humans. IQ tests provide a kind of summary statistic by including a range of semirelated tasks involving memory, logic, spatial processing, mathematics, and vocabulary. Sliced differently, performance on each task relies on a mixture of what\u2019s called <em>fluid</em> intelligence\u2014reasoning on the fly\u2014and <em>crystallized</em> intelligence\u2014applying learned knowledge or skills.</p><p>For humans in high-income countries, IQ tests often predict key outcomes, such as academic and career success. But we can\u2019t make the same assumptions about AI, whose abilities aren\u2019t bundled in the same way. An IQ test designed for humans might not say the same thing about a machine as it does about a person.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>There are other kinds of intelligence that aren\u2019t usually evaluated by IQ tests\u2014and are even further out of reach for most AI benchmarks. These include types of social intelligence, such as the ability to make psychological inferences, and types of physical intelligence, such as an understanding of causal relations between objects and forces or the ability to coordinate a body in an environment. Both are crucial for humans navigating complex situations.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"An old black-and-white photograph shows a man in a long coat standing next to a horse.

You must beware of both false positives and false negatives. Maybe the test taker appears smart only by taking shortcuts, like <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Clever-Hans\" target=\"_blank\">Clever Hans</a>, the famous horse that appeared to be capable of math but actually responded to nonverbal cues. Or maybe test takers appear stupid only because they are unfamiliar with the testing procedure or have perceptual difficulties.</p><p>It\u2019s also hard because notions of intelligence vary across place and time. \u201cThere is an interesting shift in our society in terms of what we think intelligence is and what aspects of it are valuable,\u201d says <a href=\"https://anna-ivanova.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Ivanova</a>, an assistant professor of psychology at Georgia Tech. For example, before encyclopedias and the Internet, \u201chaving a large access to facts in your head was considered a hallmark of intelligence.\u201d Now we increasingly prize fluid over crystallized intelligence.</p><h2>The History of AI Intelligence Tests</h2><p>Over the years, many people have presented machines with grand challenges that purported to require intelligence on par with our own. In 1958, a trio of prominent AI researchers <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5392645\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>, \u201cChess is the intellectual game <em><em>par excellence.</em></em>\u2026 If one could devise a successful chess machine, one would seem to have penetrated to the core of human intellectual endeavor.\u201d They did acknowledge the theoretical possibility that such a machine \u201cmight have discovered something that was as the wheel to the human leg: a device quite different from humans in its methods, but supremely effective in its way, and perhaps very simple.\u201d But they stood their ground: \u201cThere appears to be nothing of this sort in sight.\u201d In 1997, something of this sort was very much in sight when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\" target=\"_blank\">beat Garry Kasparov</a>, the reigning chess champion, while lacking the general intelligence even to play checkers.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A man leans over a chess board on a desk, studying the pieces.

For decades, passing what\u2019s now called the Turing test was considered a nearly impossible challenge and a strong indicator of AGI.</p><p>But this year, researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that when people conversed with both another person and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for 5 minutes and then had to guess which one was human, they picked the AI 73 percent of the time. Meanwhile, top language models frequently make mistakes that few people ever would, like miscounting the number of times the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@anthonyokeh/llms-worst-nightmare-the-strawberry-problem-af0b95ff05c2\" target=\"_blank\">letter<em><em> r</em></em> occurs in<em><em> strawberry</em></em></a>. They appear to be more wheel than human leg. So scientists are still searching for measures of humanlike intelligence that can\u2019t be hacked.</p><h2>The ARC Test for AGI</h2><p>There\u2019s one AGI benchmark that, while not perfect, has gained a high profile as a foil for most new frontier models. In 2019, <a href=\"https://fchollet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fran\u00e7ois Chollet</a>, then a software engineer at Google and now a founder of the AI startup <a href=\"https://ndea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ndea</a>, released a paper titled \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547\" target=\"_blank\">On the Measure of Intelligence</a>.\u201d Many people equate intelligence to ability, and general intelligence to a broad set of abilities. Chollet takes a narrower view of intelligence, counting only one specific ability as important\u2014the ability to acquire new abilities easily. Large language models (LLMs) like those powering ChatGPT do well on many benchmarks only after training on trillions of written words. When LLMs encounter a situation very unlike their training data, they frequently flop, unable to adjust. In Chollet\u2019s sense, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-do-you-test-the-iq-of-ai\" target=\"_self\">they lack intelligence</a>.</p><p>To go along with the paper, Chollet created a new AGI benchmark, called the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (<a href=\"https://arcprize.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ARC</a>). It features hundreds of visual puzzles, each with several demonstrations and one test. A demonstration has an input grid and an output grid, both filled with colored squares. The test has just an input grid. The challenge is to learn a rule from the demonstrations and apply it in the test, creating a new output grid.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two examples show small colorful shapes on black grids labeled \\u201cinput\\u201d and, on grids labeled \\u201coutput,\\u201d those same shapes at a larger scale and now interlocking. The test shows another input grid with small shapes, and a blank output grid.     \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"14ef1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-examples-show-small-colorful-shapes-on-black-grids-labeled-u201cinput-u201d-and-on-grids-labeled-u201coutput-u201d-those.png?id=61614421&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus challenges AI systems to infer abstract rules from just a few examples. Given examples of input-output grids, the system must apply the hidden pattern to a new test case\u2014something humans find easy but machines still struggle with. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>ARC focuses on fluid intelligence. \u201cTo solve any problem, you need some knowledge, and then you\u2019re going to recombine that knowledge on the fly,\u201d Chollet told me. To make it a test not of stored knowledge but of how one recombines it, the training puzzles are supposed to supply all the \u201ccore knowledge priors\u201d one needs. These include concepts like object cohesion, symmetry, and counting\u2014the kind of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-computers-learn-common-sense\" target=\"_blank\">common sense</a> a small child has. Given this training and just a few examples, can you figure out which knowledge to apply to a new puzzle? Humans can do most of the puzzles easily, but AI struggled, at least at first. Eventually, OpenAI created a version of its o3 reasoning model that <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough\" target=\"_blank\">outperformed the average human test taker</a>, achieving a score of 88 percent\u2014albeit at an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11831\" target=\"_blank\">estimated computing cost</a> of US $20,000 per puzzle. (OpenAI never released that model, so it\u2019s not on the leaderboard chart.)</p><p>This March, Chollet introduced a harder version, called <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/blog/announcing-arc-agi-2-and-arc-prize-2025\" target=\"_blank\">ARC-AGI-2</a>. It\u2019s overseen by his new nonprofit, the ARC Prize Foundation. \u201cOur mission is to serve as a North Star towards AGI through enduring benchmarks,\u201d the group announced. ARC Prize is offering a million dollars in prize money, the bulk going to teams whose trained AIs can solve 85 percent of 120 new puzzles using only four graphics processors for 12 hours or less. The new puzzles are more complex than those from 2019, sometimes requiring the application of multiple rules, reasoning for multiple steps, or interpreting symbols. The average human score is 60 percent, and as of this writing the <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\">best AI score</a> is about 16 percent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Two charts show different AI models\\u2019 performance on the ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 tests, with the score on the x axis and the cost per task on the y axis.\\u00a0\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"958cd\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-charts-show-different-ai-models-u2019-performance-on-the-arc-agi-1-and-arc-agi-2-tests-with-the-score-on-the-x-axis-and-the.png?id=61618135&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">AI models have made gradual progress on the first version of the ARC-AGI benchmark, which was introduced in 2019. This year, the ARC Prize launched a new version with harder puzzles, which AI models are struggling with. Models are labeled low, medium, high, or thinking to indicate how much computing power they expend on their answers, with \u201cthinking\u201d models using the most.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">ARC Prize</small></p><p>AI experts acknowledge ARC\u2019s value, and also its flaws. <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/\" target=\"_blank\">Jiaxuan You</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says ARC is \u201ca very good theoretical benchmark\u201d that can shed light on how algorithms function, but \u201cit\u2019s not taking into account the real-world complexity of AI applications, such as social reasoning tasks.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://melaniemitchell.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Melanie Mitchell</a>, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute, says it \u201ccaptures some interesting capabilities that humans have,\u201d such as the ability to abstract a new rule from a few examples. But given the narrow task format, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it captures what people mean when they say general intelligence.\u201d</p><p>Despite these caveats, ARC-AGI-2 may be the AI benchmark with the biggest performance gap between advanced AI and regular people, making it a potent indicator of AGI\u2019s headway. What\u2019s more, ARC is a work in progress. Chollet says AI might match human performance on the current test in a year or two, and he\u2019s already working on ARC-AGI-3. Each task will be like a miniature video game, in which the player needs to figure out the relevant concepts, the possible actions, and the goal.</p><h2>What Attributes Should an AGI Benchmark Test?</h2><p>Researchers keep rolling out benchmarks that probe different aspects of general intelligence. Yet each also reveals how incomplete our map of the territory remains.</p><p>One recent paper introduced <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=VsJ1K2HV3k\" target=\"_blank\">General-Bench</a>, a benchmark that uses five input modalities\u2014text, images, video, audio, 3D\u2014to test AI systems on hundreds of tasks that demand recognition, reasoning, creativity, ethical judgment, and other abilities to both comprehend and generate material. Ideally, an AGI would show synergy, leveraging abilities across tasks to outperform the best AI specialists. But at present, no AI can even handle all five modalities.</p><p>Other benchmarks involve virtual worlds. An April paper in <em><em>Nature</em></em> reports on <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08744-2\" target=\"_blank\">Dreamer</a>, a general algorithm from Google DeepMind that learned to perform over 150 tasks, including playing Atari games, controlling virtual robots, and obtaining diamonds in <em><em>Minecraft</em></em>. These tasks require perception, exploration, long-term planning, and interaction, but it\u2019s unclear how well Dreamer would handle real-world messiness. Controlling a video game is easier than controlling a real robot, says <a href=\"https://danijar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Danijar Hafner</a>, the paper\u2019s lead author: \u201cThe character never falls on his face.\u201d The tasks also lack rich interaction with humans and an understanding of language in the context of gestures and surroundings. \u201cYou should be able to tell your household robot, \u2018Put the dishes into that cabinet and not over there,\u2019 and you point at [the cabinet] and it understands,\u201d he says. Hafner says his team is working to make the simulations and tasks more realistic.</p><p>Aside from these extant benchmarks, experts have long debated what an ideal demonstration would look like. Back in 1970, the AI pioneer Marvin Minsky <a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/robot/1970-darrach.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em><em>Life</em></em> that in \u201cthree to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being. I mean a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight.\u201d That panel of tasks seems like a decent start, if you could operationalize the game of office politics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby.</p><p>One 2024 paper in <em><em>Engineering</em></em> proposed the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209580992300293X\" target=\"_blank\">Tong test</a> (<em><em>tong</em></em> is Chinese for \u201cgeneral\u201d). Virtual people would be assigned randomized tasks that test not only understanding but values. For example, AIs might unexpectedly encounter money on the floor or a crying baby, giving researchers the opportunity to observe what the AIs do. The authors argue that benchmarks should test an AI\u2019s ability to explore and set its own goals, its alignment with human values, its causal understanding, and its ability to control a virtual or physical body. What\u2019s more, the benchmark should be capable of generating an infinite number of tasks involving dynamic physical and social interactions.</p><p>Others, like Minsky, have suggested tests that require interacting with the real world to various degrees: making coffee in an unfamiliar kitchen, turning a hundred thousand dollars into a million, or attending college on campus and earning a degree. Unfortunately, some of these tests are impractical and risk causing real-world harm. For example, an AI might earn its million by scamming people.</p><p>I asked Hinton, the Nobel Prize winner, what skills will be the hardest for AI to acquire. \u201cI used to think it was things like figuring out what other people are thinking,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s already doing some of that. It\u2019s already able to do deception.\u201d (In a recent multi-university <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, an LLM outperformed humans at persuading test takers to select wrong answers.) He went on: \u201cSo, right now my answer is plumbing. Plumbing in an old house requires reaching into funny crevices and screwing things the right way. And I think that\u2019s probably safe for another 10 years.\u201d</p><p>Researchers debate whether the ability to perform physical tasks is required to demonstrate AGI. A paper from Google DeepMind on measuring <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=0ofzEysK2D\" target=\"_blank\">levels of AGI</a> says no, arguing that intelligence can show itself in software alone. They frame physical ability as an add-on rather than a requirement for AGI.</p><p>Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute says we should test capabilities involved in doing an entire job. She noted that AI can do many tasks of a human radiologist but can\u2019t replace the human because the job entails a lot of tasks that even the radiologist doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re doing, like figuring out what tasks to do and dealing with unexpected problems. \u201cThere\u2019s such a long tail of things that can happen in the world,\u201d she says. Some robotic vacuum cleaners weren\u2019t trained to recognize dog poop, she notes, and so they smeared it around the carpet. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of stuff like that that you don\u2019t think of when you\u2019re building an intelligent system.\u201d</p><p>Some scientists say we should observe not only performance but what\u2019s happening under the hood. A recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11581\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> coauthored by <a href=\"http://jeffclune.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Clune</a>, a computer scientist at the University of British Columbia, in Canada, reports that deep learning often leads AI systems to create \u201cfractured entangled representations\u201d\u2014basically a bunch of jury-rigged shortcuts wired together. Humans, though, look for broad, elegant regularities in the world. An AI system might appear intelligent based on one test, but if you don\u2019t know the system\u2019s innards, you could be surprised when you deploy it in a new situation and it applies the wrong rule.</p><h2>AGI Is Already Here, and Never Will Be</h2><p>The author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll\" target=\"_blank\">Lewis Carroll</a> once wrote of a character who used a map of the nation \u201con the scale of a mile to the mile!\u201d before eventually using the country as its own map. In the case of intelligence testing, the most thorough map of how someone will perform in a situation is to test them in the situation itself. In that vein, a strong test of AGI might be to have a robot live a full human life and, say, raise a child to adulthood.</p><p>\u201cUltimately, the real test of the capabilities of AI is what they do in the real world,\u201d Clune told me. \u201cSo rather than benchmarks, I prefer to look at which scientific discoveries [AIs] make, and which jobs they automate. If people are hiring them to do work instead of a human and sticking with that decision, that\u2019s extremely telling about the capabilities of AI.\u201d But sometimes you want to know how well something will do <em><em>before</em></em> asking it to replace a person.</p><p>We may never agree on what AGI or \u201chumanlike\u201d AI means, or what suffices to prove it. As AI advances, machines will still make mistakes, and people will point to these and say the AIs aren\u2019t really intelligent. Ivanova, the psychologist at Georgia Tech, was on a panel recently, and the moderator asked about AGI timelines. \u201cWe had one person saying that it might never happen,\u201d Ivanova told me, \u201cand one person saying that it already happened.\u201d So the term \u201cAGI\u201d may be convenient shorthand to express an aim\u2014or a fear\u2014but its practical use may be limited. In most cases, it should come with an asterisk, and a benchmark. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

Her father, a furniture store owner, and her mother, an artisan, instilled in her a love for learning and allowed her the freedom to dream big.</p><p>In 2012 she enrolled at <a href=\"https://www.unibh.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centro Universit\u00e1rio de Belo Horizonte</a> (UniBH) to study civil engineering. Delci chose what she calls a \u201csandwich bachelor\u2019s program\u201d\u2014an arrangement in which students begin their studies at their chosen local university, complete part of their coursework at a university abroad, and then return to their home institution to finish the degree.</p><p>In 2014 she was awarded a full scholarship by Brazil\u2019s federal <a href=\"https://estudonoexterior.com/science-without-borders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Without Borders</a> grant program. It covered tuition, housing, health insurance, learning materials, and airfare.</p><p>\u201cI believed that international academic experience would broaden my perspective and greatly enhance my education,\u201d Delci says. <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">But, she adds, she had to learn a new language to continue her studies.</a> First she took intensive English courses at <a href=\"https://ejf.hu/en/welcome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">E\u00f6tv\u00f6s J\u00f3zsef College</a>, in Baja, Hungary. She then completed two semesters of civil engineering courses, taught in English, at the <a href=\"https://www.bme.hu/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>. From May to July 2015, she interned at <a href=\"https://www.vizmuvek.hu/en/home/aboutourcompany/company-information\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest Waterworks</a>, a city utility. She worked in the three main departments of the company: engineering, project management, and water treatment.</p><p>Delci returned to UniBH in the second semester of 2015 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2017. That same year, she earned a technical diploma in civil construction process operations from the <a href=\"https://www.fiemg.com.br/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federa\u00e7\u00e3o das Ind\u00fastrias do Estado de Minas Gerais</a>, a regional industry association based in Belo Horizonte.

In 2012, during her first stint at UniBH, she was an intern at <a href=\"https://www.delphiautoparts.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Delphi</a> Automotive Systems do Brasil, in Itabirito, Minas Gerais. The role gave her hands-on experience in infrastructure maintenance of the industrial plant, including preparing purchase requisitions and work orders, as well as monitoring modifications in the plant layout, she says.</p><p>She joined Salum Constru\u00e7\u00f5es in 2020 as a trainee engineer<strong>. </strong>She worked on the remediation of waste rock piles at the <a href=\"https://vale.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vale</a> <a href=\"https://www.gem.wiki/Vale_Vargem_Grande_Complex_Mine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vargem Grande complex</a> in Minas Gerais, part of Brazil\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://ief.mg.gov.br/w/floor-of-riches-the-iron-quadrangle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Quadrangle</a>.\u201d The site is one of many owned by Vale, the world\u2019s leading producer of iron ore.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cI want to keep working on sustainable solutions, mentoring young engineers, and influencing policy to make the industry more environmentally responsible.\u201d</p><p>The initiative was part of Vale\u2019s broader efforts to minimize reliance on tailings dams\u2014earthen structures built to contain waste byproducts of ore processing\u2014 particularly after Brazil\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/09/world/americas/brazil-dam-collapse.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Brumadinho dam disaster</a> in 2019.

Such modeling makes the entire project more predictable by allowing teams to anticipate and mitigate risks before they impact the schedule. Her work also focuses on construction principles borrowed from<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/its-not-easy-being-lean\" target=\"_self\"> lean manufacturing</a> that emphasize reducing waste.</p><p>Her approach and knowledge have drawn the attention of her Salum peers and the construction industry at large, she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about digital engineering and how it can help reduce costs, save time, and improve safety,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about getting the work done.

She has received recognition for leading initiatives that use digital technology to improve large-scale construction. A key indicator of this recognition is the widespread citation of her research by experts. For instance, her articles \u2018Digital Monitoring of Heavy Equipment...\u2019 and \u2018The Effectiveness of Last Planner System...\u2019 have been cited 66 and 56 times, respectively, according to Google Scholar. In academia, this level of citation is an exceptionally high honor, demonstrating that her work is a foundational and influential contribution to the advancement of knowledge in her field.</p><h2>The IEEE advantage</h2><p>Delci heard about IEEE through colleagues who praised its global network of members and technical resources.

Matey. The microscope was an unintentional by-product of the VideoDisc technology the company had been struggling to bring to market since the mid-1960s. RCA expected the VideoDisc to capture half of the home video market, but instead it lost out in a big way to VHS.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a bearded white man with glasses looking at a microscope.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"68e92\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-bearded-white-man-with-glasses-looking-at-a-microscope.jpg?id=61607929&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">RCA\u2019s James.

Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology obliged. Starting in the early 1990s, they too cannibalized capacitance sensors from old VideoDisc players and custom-built a series of SCMs, such as the one pictured at top. After NIST\u2019s validation, microscope manufacturers commercialized the SCM, chipmakers adopted them to study integrated circuits, thus opening the door to the next generation of semiconductors.</p><h2>Why the RCA VideoDisc Failed </h2><p>But no story about the scanning capacitance microscope\u2019s triumph would be complete without some discussion of the VideoDisc\u2019s failure. In theory, it should have thrived: It was a thoroughly researched product that anticipated an important consumer market. Its playback fidelity was superior to over-the-air programming and to magnetic tape. And yet it bombed. Why?</p><p>The VideoDisc effort had begun in the early 1960s, when RCA asked itself, \u201cWhat comes after color TV? What will be the next major consumer electronics system?\u201d The company decided that the answer was some type of system to play prerecorded movies and TV shows through your television. RCA was far from alone in pursuing this idea. All of the home video systems under development included a storage medium\u2014film, magnetic tape, nonmagnetic tape, and vinyl discs of various size and composition\u2014and a device to play back the audio and video in high resolution. In addition to magnetic methods, information could be stored using electromechanical, photographic, electron-beam, or optical technologies.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a smiling man in a business suit holding a shiny flat disc and inserting a flat square object into a machine.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"dc554\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-smiling-man-in-a-business-suit-holding-a-shiny-flat-disc-and-inserting-a-flat-square-object-into-a-ma.jpg?id=61609185&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">RCA VideoDiscs were easily damaged by dust and fingerprints, so they were loaded into the SelectaVision player inside plastic sleeves.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Hagley Museum and Library</small></p><p>By 1964, RCA had settled on VideoDiscs. Like a record album (which the company had pioneered), a VideoDisc was a grooved vinyl platter that uses a stylus for playback. Unlike a record, the VideoDisc carried both audio and video, at a much higher density, and the stylus was electrical instead of mechanical. (The VideoDisc is sometimes confused with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc\" target=\"_blank\">LaserDisc</a>, a home video technology of that era that used an optical laser.)</p><p>RCA called its discs Capacitance Electronic Discs. The VideoDisc player spun the 30-centimeter disc at a constant 450 rpm. A metallic stylus traced the depressions and bumps in the disc\u2019s groove by registering differences in capacitance, similar to the way that bringing your finger into contact with a touchscreen causes a detectable change in the screen\u2019s capacitance at that point. Solid-state circuitry unscrambled the frequency-modulated video signal encoded in the capacitance differences. These differences were on the order of femtofarads, and the video signal ran at about 910 megahertz. To get a clear picture, the VideoDisc system required very sensitive capacitance sensors to detect these tiny differences at high frequency.</p><p>Unfortunately, commercialization took much longer than expected. In 1972, RCA announced that its VideoDisc would debut the following year, but it didn\u2019t materialize. An article in <em><em>Popular Science </em></em>in February 1977 anticipated regional sales by the end of that year. But it wasn\u2019t until March 1981 that the RCA SelectaVision system finally hit the market. Despite heavy promotion, it sold poorly and was pulled from the shelves in 1984. In the end, RCA sank about US $500 million over 20 years to develop the VideoDisc, and it was a total flop.</p><h2>How Videotape Vanquished the VideoDisc</h2><p>What went wrong? In a word: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-panasonic-pv1563-vcr\" target=\"_self\">videotape</a>. Magnetic tape, which RCA had rejected, turned out to have greater consumer appeal. Introduced in 1976, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/revisiting-the-vcrs-origins\" target=\"_self\">VHS tapes</a> were cheaper, had more titles available for purchase or rent, and, importantly, allowed owners to record their own programs.</p><p>Perhaps if the VideoDisc had launched in 1973, it might have had a chance. But the technology had other problems. Fingerprints, dust, and scratches torpedoed early designs that envisioned users removing the discs from sleeves as casually as record albums; instead, the final version kept the discs encased in a plastic shell that was then inserted into the player.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a man in a lab coat and tie pulling a flat shiny disc from a protective sleeve labeled RCA SelectaVision.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"55e43\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-man-in-a-lab-coat-and-tie-pulling-a-flat-shiny-disc-from-a-protective-sleeve-labeled-rca-selectavisio.jpg?id=61607508&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">RCA spent two decades developing its home video system, but in the end the SelectaVision lost out to VHS and VCRs.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Hagley Museum and Library        </small> </p><p>Another problem was running time. In 1977, VideoDiscs could hold only about 30 minutes of material per side. That rose to an hour per side by the time of product launch, but that still meant that any movie over 120 minutes would have to be spread over multiple discs. The first VHS tapes could hold 120 minutes of video (double that of its main tape competitor, Betamax). And VHS kept extending that lead: By the 1980s, VHS had long play (four hours) and extended play (six hours) versions, albeit with noticeable drops in resolution quality.</p><p>RCA forecasters also badly misread the economics of VideoDisc players. Their 1977 price estimate for a VideoDisc player was $500 (about $2,800 in today\u2019s dollars). The first VHS players were much more expensive, ranging from $1,000 to $1,400, but by the mid-1980s, their price had dropped to $200 to $400. VHS tapes of major Hollywood films cost about $80\u2014much more than VideoDiscs\u2019 $10 to $18 price tag\u2014but only diehard fans actually paid the modern equivalent of about $440 to buy a movie on videotape. For everyone else, the Hollywood studios licensed titles to third-party rental companies. Seemingly overnight, independent video shops, supermarkets, and national chains like Blockbuster were renting movies for a small fee. For a brief period, RCA VideoDiscs shared the shelves with videotapes, but usually only at independent shops and never with as many titles available.</p><p>Meanwhile, RCA struggled to sell its VideoDisc players. The company had forecast eventual annual sales of five to six million players; its first-year goal was a more modest 200,000, and yet it sold only half that number. By 1984, RCA realized the VideoDisc would never come close to 50 percent market penetration, let alone profitability, and pulled the plug.</p><h2>Birth of the Scanning Capacitance Microscope</h2><p>Normally that would be the end of the story, another failed venture in consumer electronics. But back when RCA scientists first began researching the VideoDisc, there were no microscopes capable of identifying the tiny variations in the disc that encoded the audio/video signal. The bumps and depressions were less than a tenth the size of the groove itself; even the most advanced microscopes of the day couldn\u2019t detect features that small.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman in a hairnet, lab coat, and white gloves holding a shiny flat disc with a hole in a center, with two stacks of discs in the foreground.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5a291\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-in-a-hairnet-lab-coat-and-white-gloves-holding-a-shiny-flat-disc-with-a-hole-in-a-center-wit.jpg?id=61607494&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A factory worker inspects an RCA VideoDisc, which encoded the audio and video signals in the disc\u2019s groove.</small> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">            Hagley Museum and Library        </small> </p>And so RCA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrmatey/\" target=\"_blank\">James Matey</a> developed and patented the scanning capacitance microscope (which he abbreviated SCaM, but others wisely shortened to SCM) as a quality-control tool for manufacturing the VideoDiscs. Four years after the first patent, RCA filed a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/USRE32457E/en\" target=\"_blank\">reissue patent</a> with some corrections and improvements. In a very readable paper in the March 1985 issue of the <em><em>Journal of Applied Physics,</em></em> Matey and fellow RCA researcher Joseph Blanc explained the new technology. The SCM could detect variations in surface topography on the order of 0.3 nanometers over areas on the order of 0.5 square micrometers. RCA delayed publication of this paper until it had shuttered the VideoDisc operation, and so Matey and Blanc concluded their paper, \u201cWe are currently in the process of adapting [the SCM] for similar uses on other samples.\u201d The new use turned out to be in the manufacturing of the next generation of semiconductors.<p>Semiconductor performance depends on the distribution of intentionally introduced impurities, called dopants, which change the ability of the material to conduct electricity. In the early days of semiconductor production, manufacturers used ion mass spectroscopy and a technique called spreading resistance to measure the dopant distribution in one dimension.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">Related: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-secondhand-origins-of-silicon-valleys-ingot-industry\" target=\"_self\">The Secondhand Origins of Silicon Valley\u2019s Ingot Industry</a></p><p>By the late 1980s, integrated circuits had become so small that the industry needed a way to measure the dopants in two dimensions. The SCM, used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope, fit the bill. When the conductive tip of the atomic force microscope made contact with a semiconductor surface, it created a small capacitance, on the order of attofarads to femtofarads, depending on the dopant concentration. The SCM measured the changes of the local capacitance and mapped the dopant distributions. But the technology was still novel and not yet commercially available, so researchers at NIST took up the task of testing it.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Joseph Kopanski, Jay Marchiando, and David Berning began building a series of custom SCMs at the NIST Semiconductor Electronics Division. They did more than just reproduce Matey and Blanc\u2019s results. They also provided the industry with models and software for extracting two-dimensional dopant distribution from the capacitance measurements.</p><p>NIST\u2019s validation of the SCM led to the commercial production of the instruments, which in turn led to the development of more-advanced semiconductors\u2014an industry that is orders of magnitude more important to the global economy than a consumer product like the VideoDisc would ever have been. It\u2019s a classic tale of redemption in the history of technology: At the start of any new tech project, no one really knows what the outcome will be. Sometimes, you just have to keep going, even through abject failure, and trust that something good will emerge on the other side.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cRCA\u2019s VideoDisc Gamble Paid Off in Chips.\u201d</em></em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>My friends at NIST first suggested the scanning capacitance microscope in their collection and pointed me to <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/nist-museum/videodiscs-and-scanning-capacitance-microscope-failed-consumer-product-solves\" target=\"_blank\">a great description</a> of it.

And these are just three of the largest companies in an increasingly crowded space.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/scale/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scale Issue</a>.</p></div><p>Amplifying this message are many financial analysts: <a href=\"https://institute.bankofamerica.com/content/dam/transformation/humanoid-robots.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America Global Research</a>, for example, predicts that global humanoid robot shipments will reach 18,000 units in 2025. And <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/humanoid-robot-market-5-trillion-by-2050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley Research estimates</a> that by 2050 there could be over 1 billion humanoid robots, part of a US $5 trillion market.</p><p>But as of now, the market for humanoid robots is almost entirely hypothetical. Even the most successful companies in this space have deployed only a small handful of robots in carefully controlled pilot projects. And future projections seem to be based on an extraordinarily broad interpretation of jobs that a capable, efficient, and safe humanoid robot\u2014which does not currently exist\u2014might conceivably be able to do. Can the current reality connect with the promised scale?</p><h2>What Will It Take to Scale Humanoid Robots?</h2><p>Physically building tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of humanoid robots is certainly possible in the near term. In 2023, <a href=\"https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/record-of-4-million-robots-working-in-factories-worldwide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on the order of 500,000 industrial robots were installed worldwide</a>. Under the basic assumption that a humanoid robot is approximately equivalent to four industrial arms in terms of components, existing supply chains should be able to support even the most optimistic near-term projections for humanoid manufacturing.</p><p>But simply building the robots is arguably the easiest part of scaling humanoids, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meloneewise/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Melonee Wise</a>, who served as chief product officer at Agility Robotics until this month. \u201cThe bigger problem is demand\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone has found an application for humanoids that would require several thousand robots per facility.\u201d Large deployments, Wise explains, are the most realistic way for a robotics company to scale its business, since onboarding any new client can take weeks or months. An alternative approach to deploying several thousand robots to do a single job is to deploy several hundred robots that can each do 10 jobs, which seems to be what most of the humanoid industry is betting on in the medium to long term.</p><p>While there\u2019s a belief across much of the humanoid robotics industry that rapid progress in AI must somehow translate into rapid progress toward multipurpose robots, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/solve-robotics\" target=\"_self\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfvctjoMPk8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clear</a> how, when, or if that will happen. \u201cI think what a lot of people are hoping for is they\u2019re going to AI their way out of this,\u201d says Wise. \u201cBut the reality of the situation is that currently AI is not robust enough to meet the requirements of the market.\u201d</p><h2>Bringing Humanoid Robots to Market</h2><p><span>Market requirements for humanoid robots include a slew of extremely dull, extremely critical things like battery life, reliability, and safety. Of these, battery life is the most straightforward\u2014for a robot to usefully do a job, it can\u2019t spend most of its time charging. The next version of Agility\u2019s Digit robot, which can handle payloads of up to 16 kilograms, includes a bulky \u201cbackpack\u201d containing a battery with a charging ratio of 10 to 1: The robot can run for 90 minutes, and fully recharge in 9 minutes. Slimmer humanoid robots from other companies must necessarily be making compromises to maintain their svelte form factors.</span></p><p>In operation, Digit will probably spend a few minutes charging after running for 30 minutes. That\u2019s because 60 minutes of Digit\u2019s runtime is essentially a reserve in case something happens in its workspace that requires it to temporarily pause, a not-infrequent occurrence in the logistics and manufacturing environments that Agility is targeting. Without a 60-minute reserve, the robot would be much more likely to run out of power mid-task and need to be manually recharged. Consider what that might look like with even a modest deployment of several hundred robots weighing over a hundred kilograms each. \u201cNo one wants to deal with that,\u201d comments Wise.</p><p>Potential customers for humanoid robots are very concerned with downtime. Over the course of a month, a factory operating at 99 percent reliability will see approximately 5 hours of downtime. Wise says that any downtime that stops something like a production line can cost tens of thousands of dollars per minute, which is why many industrial customers expect a couple more 9s of reliability: 99.99 percent. Wise says that Agility has demonstrated this level of reliability in some specific applications, but not in the context of multipurpose or general-purpose functionality.</p><h2>Humanoid Robot Safety</h2><p><span>A humanoid robot in an industrial environment must meet general </span><a href=\"https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/ansi-b11-standards-safety-of-machinery/\" target=\"_blank\">safety</a><span> </span><a href=\"https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/directive-2006-42-ec-of-the-european-parliament-and-of-the-council\" target=\"_blank\">requirements</a><span> for industrial machines. In the past, robotic systems like autonomous vehicles and drones have benefited from immature regulatory environments to scale quickly. But Wise says that approach can\u2019t work for humanoids, because the industry is already heavily regulated\u2014the robot is simply considered another piece of machinery.</span></p><p>There are also more specific<a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ria/ansiriar15082020\" target=\"_blank\"> safety standards</a> currently under development for humanoid robots, explains Matt Powers, associate director of autonomy R&amp;D at Boston Dynamics. He notes that his company is helping develop an <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/91469.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) safety standard for dynamically balancing legged robots</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that the top players in the field, like Agility and Figure, are joining us in developing a way to explain why we believe that the systems that we\u2019re deploying are safe,\u201d Powers says.</p><p>These standards are necessary because the traditional safety approach of cutting power may not be a good option for a dynamically balancing system. Doing so will cause a humanoid robot to fall over, potentially making the situation even worse. There is no simple solution to this problem, and the initial approach that Boston Dynamics expects to take with its Atlas robot is to keep the robot out of situations where simply powering it off might not be the best option. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with relatively low-risk deployments, and then expand as we build confidence in our safety systems,\u201d Powers says. \u201cI think a methodical approach is really going to be the winner here.\u201d</p><p>In practice, low risk means keeping humanoid robots away from people. But humanoids that are restricted by what jobs they can safely do and where they can safely move are going to have more trouble finding tasks that provide value.</p><h2>Are Humanoids the Answer?</h2><p><span>The issues of demand, battery life, reliability, and safety all need to be solved before humanoid robots can scale. But a more fundamental question to ask is whether a bipedal robot is actually worth the trouble.</span></p><p>Dynamic balancing with legs would theoretically enable these robots to navigate complex environments like a human. Yet demo videos show these humanoid robots as either mostly stationary or repetitively moving short distances over flat floors. The promise is that what we\u2019re seeing now is just the first step toward humanlike mobility. But in the short to medium term, there are much more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective platforms that can take over in these situations: robots with arms, but with wheels instead of legs.</p><p>Safe and reliable humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize the labor market at some point in the future. But potential is just that, and despite the humanoid enthusiasm, we have to be realistic about what it will take to turn potential into reality. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>This article appears in the October 2025 print issue as \u201cWhy Humanoid Robots Aren\u2019t Scaling.\u201d</em></p>"

A memo selecting awardees for research into </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/prism\" target=\"_blank\">reducing the impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from semiconductor manufacturing</a><span> was submitted to Commerce but never approved. Three groups won parts of a </span><a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-finalizes-aidrfic-research-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">$30 million grant to transform the design of RF chips using machine learning</a><span>, but at least one awardee has gotten no word on when or whether the funding will flow.</span></p><p>\u201cThis is a sad end,\u201d said one person who requested anonymity and was involved in early debate about the NSTC. </p><p>Lutnick\u2019s characterization of Natcast\u2019s creation as cronyism \u201cis pretty frustrating,\u201d this person continued. The idea that NSTC would be operated by an independent public-private partnership, which is written into the law, came from deep consultation with industry and was intended to insulate its work from politics. The organization needed such protection to make good technical decisions, because in selecting who gets funds \u201cthere are always more losers than winners,\u201d this person said.</p><p>Over the past week, Natcast has been defending itself and its staff against Lutnick\u2019s accusations. On 4 September, in a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-member-letter-regarding-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">letter to its 200 members</a>, Hanford countered Lutnick\u2019s assertions that the organization was packed with Biden administration cronies and that it was run as a \u201cslush fund.\u201d Hanford pointed to the multiple layers of government and industry oversight Natcast operates under and the experienced semiconductor industry staff it has brought on. She added that the nonprofit had stuck to its agreements with the government, submitting 119 \u201cmilestones and deliverables\u201d to Commerce.</p><h2>What\u2019s Lost Without Natcast</h2><p>On 8 September, Natcast published a detailed <a href=\"https://natcast.org/natcast-assets-supporting-the-continued-mission-of-the-nstc\" target=\"_blank\">overview of what it has done so far</a>. Accomplishments included creating an industry-driven R&amp;D agenda, the development of multiple workforce programs, and the signing on of some 200 members. These members included cutting-edge logic and memory companies (such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skhynix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SK Hynix</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tsmc-arizona\" target=\"_self\">TSMC</a>), small companies like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/atomera-plans-to-breathe-new-life-into-older-chip-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">Atomera</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=encharge+ai\" target=\"_self\">EnCharge AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">Polar Semiconductor</a>, and multiple universities and makers of semiconductor tools and equipment.</p><p><a href=\"https://natcast.org/nstcmembership/members\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Members</a> had the right to use facilities and other infrastructure that Natcast was standing up (for a fee) and participate in research. One goal for the infrastructure was to reduce the time from concept to prototype by 30 percent. Access to the tools and processes NSTC would provide is out of reach for even some of the country\u2019s top researchers, <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>\u2019s source said. Without that access, startups and researchers won\u2019t be able to afford to do relevant work using 300-millimeter wafers and advanced chip-technology nodes. Despite the fact that not all of its facilities were complete, Natcast had plans to proceed with research by chaining together existing infrastructure around the country.</p><p>In addition, the document from 8 September detailed the expert in-house team at Natcast, and said that expertise allowed it to evaluate R&amp;D awards at twice the rate of federal agencies while requiring considerably less overhead than government, universities, and non-profit research organizations like Imec. (It forecast a 10 percent overhead on expenses over 10 years.)</p><p>\u201cNatcast was supposed to do what industry couldn\u2019t solve by itself,\u201d said a source familiar with the situation. Its R&amp;D program was aimed at solving big problems, such as collapsing the time and energy required to <a href=\"https://natcast.org/research-and-development/smap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">move data between memory and computing</a>, in a way that the whole industry could benefit from.<span></span></p>"

These days, however, blockchain is most famous as the tool enabling <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money?utm_campaign=post-teaser&amp;utm_content=ibfuflhf\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies</a>. Most recently</span><span>, the Trump administration has </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/business/bitcoin-crypto-rally-us-stocks\" target=\"_blank\">taken</a><span> on a pro-cryptocurrency stance, boosting blockchain\u2019s </span>popularity and media prominence.</p><p><span>Cryptography is central to the functioning of blockchains, whether for a decentralized Web or for cryptocurrencies. Every time a cryptocurrency transaction is initiated, all parties involved in the transaction need to securely prove that they agree to the transfer. This is done via a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\" target=\"_blank\">digital signature</a>: a cryptographic protocol that generates a secret, private key that is unique to each user and a public key that the user shares. Then, the private key is used to generate a unique signature for each transaction. The public key can be used to verify that, indeed, the signature was created by the holder of the private key. In this way, Web3 in every incarnation relies heavily on cryptography. </span></p><p><span>To learn more about the evolution of Web3, and cryptography\u2019s role, we caught up with</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://wahby.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Riad Wahby</a><span>, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, and a cofounder and CEO of hardware-backed Web3 security platform </span><a href=\"https://cubist.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Cubist</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> Wahby explained what Web3 was meant to be, what it\u2019s become, and how hardware-backed cryptography will enable its future.<br /></span></p><h3>Web3 Began as a Response to What Came Before</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: What is Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Riad Wahby:</strong> That\u2019s the hardest question that you\u2019re going to ask by far, because I don\u2019t know how to answer it in a way that satisfies everyone.</p><p>The term Web3 was coined around 2014, by people who looked at the way that the Web had developed. Web 1.0 was the first Web bubble, the dot-com bubble. Web 2.0, roughly speaking, is Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Apple and Netflix, and the like. And the perception, especially from folks who originally coined this term Web3, was that these companies had basically taken the Web in the wrong direction, because your privacy is gone, and you\u2019re the product, so to speak. You use Gmail for free because Google is mining your emails to sell things like better advertising. Web3 was originally a reaction to this. Early proponents of Web3 basically said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We want to take back control of our stuff. I want to own my own data, and maybe cryptocurrencies and blockchains are the way there.\u201d So that\u2019s where the term originally came from.</p><p><strong>What does the term mean now?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Now it doesn\u2019t mean anything like that at all. Now Web3 is the broader ecosystem around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. And I think basically all of that revolutionary spirit has gone away in favor of building financial products and making a lot of money doing it. As far as I can tell, the term has really transformed from a reaction to a lack of privacy and a lack of sovereignty in my own data to \u201cHey, this is a technology that has something to do with blockchains.\u201d Maybe you can buy some kind of speculative meme coin and make a bunch of money doing it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe that took a dark turn at the end. That\u2019s how things go.</p><p><strong>How are those two definitions connected?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Cryptography really fits into the revolutionary spirit, in the sense that the folks who want to cast off the chains of things like Google and Facebook, one of the tenets was\u2014\u201dThe way that we\u2019ll do that is we\u2019ll build this technology that\u2019s sort of amazing and that gives us all these great properties.\u201d And they were going to do that using some advanced cryptographic technologies. This is the reason that there\u2019s so many people who are cryptography researchers at universities that also are involved deeply in some kind of cryptocurrency. Because it\u2019s like this is a sea change in the way that cryptography gets used in the world.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it used to be that if you were working on really any kind of cryptography, regardless of how theoretical or how practical you intended it to be, you knew that there was not much of a chance that any of it was going to get really used in the world, unless it was extremely practical and extremely focused on solving some immediate problem. And it just used to be the case that people were extremely conservative about what kind of cryptography they used. Basically, everyone thought, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of this crazy stuff. That\u2019s all theory. Nobody cares. The only stuff we need is what lets you connect to Amazon and safely buy stuff.\u201d The rise of cryptocurrencies brought with it this whole shift in the way that cryptography gets deployed in the world, where now if you can come up with some interesting functionality that\u2019s enabled by some advanced cryptography, probably somewhere somebody is going to try and turn that into a product that they can sell.</p><h3>Web3 Is Both Good and Bad for Cryptography</h3><p><strong>What effect has this had on the cryptographic community?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> It\u2019s both good and bad. It\u2019s good in that this means that there\u2019s a lot of motivation to build interesting, cool stuff. And as a researcher in cryptography, I love it because it means that there\u2019s tons more research money being poured into cryptography.</p><p>That\u2019s the good side. The bad side is that the reason that people were so conservative about deploying new cryptography is that it\u2019s easy to get the security mechanism wrong. The default state of cryptography is [to assume everything is] broken. You have to be very, very careful that each change that you make isn\u2019t returning your cryptography to the default state. I\u2019m not saying that people in Web3 aren\u2019t careful. They are. It\u2019s just by the nature of things, since it\u2019s a much faster time frame, there\u2019s much more pressure to just push stuff into production. And I think the downside is that we have seen a little bit of brokenness. It\u2019s hopefully not causing people to lose oodles of money. And I think the historical record bears this out: People lose oodles of money because other people are really dishonest, not because the cryptography is broken for the most part. But the cryptography can also be broken, and that can also be worrisome. But I\u2019d say from the perspective of somebody who\u2019s doing research in cryptography, the impact of Web3 on the cryptographic community has generally been a good thing.</p><p><strong>Now you\u2019re focused on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip\" target=\"_blank\">hardware security</a>. Can you explain what that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Any cryptocurrency has this property that if I hold some token, and I want to send it to somebody else, the way that I do that is by producing a digital signature that says, I want to spend this token. The secret key is what lets you generate a signature. So if you have 10 <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-merge-heralds-cryptos-climate-friendly-future\" target=\"_blank\">E</a>TH [cryptocurrency coins], and they\u2019re all protected by this key, and somebody takes a copy of your key, then life is bad.</p><p>With a digital signature key it could just be sitting on your hard drive, and then you get some malware, and now somebody has silently stolen your key. There have been these big, broadly targeted malware campaigns where millions and millions of people have all had their keys stolen. So now the criminals are just like sitting there counting up all the money that they\u2019ve stolen, and there\u2019s no reversing transactions, unlike at a bank.</p><p>Here\u2019s where hardware comes in. This is not really a Web3 technology, this is kind of old, good stuff. There are these devices called hardware security modules, and they\u2019ve been used for multiple decades. This is a physical device, and this device can run certain cryptographic algorithms. And it knows enough that when you tell it, \u201cHey, please generate me a key,\u201d it can generate you a key securely. And when you tell it, \u201cPlease give me a signature,\u201d it can give you a signature securely. But the important thing is the way that it\u2019s designed, the key never leaves this piece of hardware. It turns what was a piece of data into a physical object. And we know how to secure a physical object.</p><p><strong>You\u2019re working on extending hardware security for more use cases. Can you explain what you\u2019re doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> There are two issues with the standard hardware security module.</p><p>No. 1, you need more cryptography support, so you need to be able to apply digital signatures to transactions very quickly if you\u2019re actively trading. And No. 2, you need a way of expressing that it\u2019s not just a key that can generate any signature. It\u2019s a key that also has attached to it some kind of policy that says these are the kinds of signatures that are okay to generate, and everything else is not allowed, to add extra security. These are the two directions that we have that our technology enables within traditional hardware security modules.</p><p>We start with the security that\u2019s provided by the traditional hardware security module, and we extend it using this, actually another piece of trusted hardware called the Trusted Execution Environment. We extend it to support the actual kinds of cryptography that are needed for Web3 and to support this rich programmable policy layer that lets you say, \u201cThis key is only intended for this specific kind of use,\u201d or \u201canytime somebody tries to make a payment from this key, first I have to check whether the recipient is subject to sanctions,\u201d or any other rule. So in the end, we have, not only a hardware security module, we have also this Trusted Execution Environment and this policy layer, and all this other cryptographic stuff that together gives us a hardware security module that\u2019s really designed for the Web3 use case.</p>"

But fundamental shifts in how people are coding may not just make it harder to measure popularity, but could even make the concept itself irrelevant. And then things might get </span><em><em>really</em></em><span> weird. To see why, let\u2019s start with this year\u2019s rankings and a quick refresher of how we put this thing together.</span></p><p>In the \u201c<em><em>Spectrum</em></em>\u201d default ranking, which is weighted with the interests of IEEE members in mind, we see that once again<a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Python</a> has the top spot, with the biggest change in the top five being<a href=\"https://javascript.info/\" target=\"_blank\"> JavaScript</a>\u2019s drop from third place last year to sixth place this year. As JavaScript is often used to create web pages, and vibe coding is often used to create websites, this drop in the apparent popularity may be due to the effects of AI that we\u2019ll dig into in a moment. But first to finish up with this year\u2019s scores, in the \u201cJobs\u201d ranking, which looks exclusively at what skills employers are looking for, we see that Python has also taken 1<span>st</span> place, up from second place last year, though<a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/sql/\" target=\"_blank\"> SQL</a> expertise remains an incredibly valuable skill to have on your resume.</p><p>Because we can\u2019t literally look over the shoulders of everyone who codes, including kids hacking on<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mods\" target=\"_blank\"> Minecraft</a> servers or academic researchers developing new architectures, we rely on proxies to measure popularity. We detail <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-methodology-2025\" target=\"_blank\">our methodology here</a>, but the upshot is that we merge metrics from multiple sources to create our rankings. The metrics we choose publicly signal interest across a wide range of languages\u2014Google search traffic, questions asked on<a href=\"https://stackexchange.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Stack Exchange</a>, mentions in research papers, activity on the GitHub open source code repository, and so on.</p><p>But programmers are turning away from many of these public expressions of interest. Rather than page through a book or search a website like Stack Exchange for answers to their questions, they\u2019ll chat with an LLM like<a href=\"https://claude.ai/\" target=\"_blank\"> Claude</a> or <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> in a private conversation. And with an AI assistant like <a href=\"https://cursor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cursor</a> helping to write code, the need to pose questions in the first place is significantly decreased. For example, across the total set of languages evaluated in the TPL, the number of questions we saw posted per week on Stack Exchange in 2025 was just 22 percent of what it was in 2024.</p><p>With less signal in publicly available metrics, it becomes harder to track popularity across a broad range of languages. This existential problem for our rankings can be tackled by searching for new metrics, or trying to survey programmers\u2014in all their variety\u2014directly. <span>However, an even more fundamental problem is looming in the wings.</span></p><p>Whether it\u2019s a seasoned coder<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-code\" target=\"_self\"> using an AI to handle the grunt work</a>, or a neophyte vibe coding a complete web app, AI assistance means that programmers can concern themselves less and less with the particulars of any language. First details of syntax, then flow control and functions, and so on up the levels of how a program is put together\u2014more and more is being left to the AI.</p><p>Although code-writing LLM\u2019s are still very much a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-for-coding\" target=\"_self\">work in progress</a>, as they take over an increasing share of the work, programmers inevitably shift from being the kind of people willing to fight religious wars over whether source code should be indented by<a href=\"https://youtu.be/cowtgmZuai0?si=R4uNNt2P3Ynxb0wG\" target=\"_blank\"> typing tabs or spaces</a> to people who care less and less about what <em>language</em> is used.</p><p>After all, the whole reason different computer languages exist is because given a particular challenge, it\u2019s easier to express a solution in one language versus another. You wouldn\u2019t<a href=\"https://github.com/mnr/rpigpior\" target=\"_blank\"> control a washing machine</a> using the<a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> R programming language</a>, or conversely do a statistical analysis on large datasets using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\">C</a>.</p><p>But it <em><em>is</em></em> technically possible to do both. A human might tear their hair out doing it, but LLMs have about as much hair as they do sentience. As long as there\u2019s enough training data, they\u2019ll generate code for a given prompt in any language you want. In practical terms, this means using one\u2014any one\u2014of today\u2019s most popular general purpose programming languages. In the same way most developers today don\u2019t pay much attention to the instruction sets and other hardware idiosyncrasies of the CPUs that their code runs on, which language a program is vibe coded in ultimately becomes a minor detail.</p><p>Sure, there will always be some people who care, just as today there are nerds like me willing to debate the merits of writing for the<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-zilog-z80-microprocessor\" target=\"_self\"> Z80</a> versus the<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-mos-technology-6502-microprocessor\" target=\"_self\"> 6502</a> 8-bit CPUs. But overall, the popularity of different computer languages could become as obscure a topic as the relative popularity of railway track gauges.</p><p>One obvious long-term consequence to this is that it will become harder for new languages to emerge. Previously, new languages could emerge from individuals or small teams evangelizing their approach to potential contributors and users. Presentations, papers, demos, sample code and tutorials seeded new developer ecosystems. A single well-written book, like Leo Brodie\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>Starting Forth</em></em></a> or Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchies\u2019<a href=\"https://ia903407.us.archive.org/35/items/the-ansi-c-programming-language-by-brian-w.-kernighan-dennis-m.-ritchie.org/The%20ANSI%20C%20Programming%20Language%20by%20Brian%20W.%20Kernighan%2C%20Dennis%20M.%20Ritchie.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>The C Programming Language</em></em></a>, could make an enormous difference to a language\u2019s popularity.</p><p>But while a few samples and a tutorial can be enough material to jump-start adoption among programmers familiar with the ins and outs of hands-on coding, it\u2019s not enough for today\u2019s AIs. Humans build mental models that can extrapolate from relatively small amounts of data. LLMs rely on statistical probabilities, so the more data they can crunch, they better they are. Consequently programmers have noted that<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1gf9aap/training_ai_on_lesser_known_languages/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> AIs give noticeably poorer results</a> when trying to code in less-used languages.</p><p>There are research efforts to<a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/making-ai-generated-code-more-accurate-0418\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> make LLMs more universal coders</a>, but that doesn\u2019t really help new languages get off the ground. Fundamentally new languages grow because they are scratching some itch a programmer has. That itch can be as small as being<a href=\"https://www.codewithc.com/why-python-doesnt-use-semicolon-pythons-syntax-design/?amp=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> annoyed at semicolons</a> having to be placed after every statement, or as large as a philosophical argument about the<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> purpose of computation</a>.</p><p>But if an AI is soothing our irritations with today\u2019s languages, will any new ones ever reach the kind of critical mass needed to make an impact? Will the popularity of today\u2019s languages remain frozen in time?</p><h2>What\u2019s the future of programming languages?</h2><p>Before speculating further about the future, let\u2019s touch base again where we are today. Modern high-level computer languages are really designed to do two things: create an abstraction layer that makes it easier to process data in a suitable fashion, and stop programmers from shooting themselves in the foot.</p><p>The first objective has been around since the days of<a href=\"https://fortran-lang.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Fortran</a> and<a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/languages/cobol/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Cobol</a>, aimed at processing scientific and business data respectively. The second objective emerged later, spurred in no small part by Edgar Dijkstra\u2019s 1968 paper \u201c<a href=\"https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a>.\u201d In this he argued for eliminating the ability for a programmer to make jumps to arbitrary points in their code. This restriction was to prevent so-called spaghetti code that makes it hard for a programmer to understand how a computer actually executes a given program. Instead, Dijkstra demanded that programmers bend to structural rules imposed by the language. Dijkstra\u2019s argument ultimately won the day, and most modern languages do indeed minimize or eliminate Go Tos altogether in favor of structures like functions and other programmatic blocks.</p><p>These structures don\u2019t exist at the level of the CPU. If you look at the instruction sets for Arm, x86, or RISC-V processors, the flow of a program is controlled by just three types of machine code instructions. These are conditional jumps, unconditional jumps, and jumps with a trace stored (so you can call a subroutine and return to where you started). In other words, it\u2019s Go Tos all the way down. Similarly, strict <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type\" target=\"_blank\">data types</a> designed to label and protect data from incorrect use dissolve into anonymous bits flowing in and out of memory.</p><p>So how much abstraction and anti-foot-shooting structure will a sufficiently-advanced coding AI really need? A hint comes from recent research in AI-assisted hardware design, such as<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11103838\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Dall-EM</a>, a generative AI developed at Princeton University used to create RF and electromagnetic filters.  Designing these filters has always been something of a black art, involving the wrangling of complex electromagnetic fields as they swirl around little strips of metal. But Dall-EM can take in the desired inputs and outputs and spit out something that looks like a QR code. The results are something no human would ever design\u2014but it works.</p><p>Similarly, could we get our AIs to go straight from prompt to an<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> intermediate language</a> that could be fed into the interpreter or compiler of our choice? Do we need high-level languages at all in that future? True, this would turn programs into inscrutable black boxes, but they could still be divided into modular testable units for sanity and quality checks. And instead of trying to read or maintain source code, programmers would just tweak their prompts and generate software afresh.</p><p>What\u2019s the role of the programmer in a future without source code? Architecture design and algorithm selection would remain vital skills\u2014for example, should a pathfinding program use a classic approach like the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> A* algorithm</a>, or instead should it try to<a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-method-is-the-fastest-way-to-find-the-best-routes-20250806/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> implement a new </a>method? How should a piece of software be interfaced with a larger system? How should new hardware be exploited? In this scenario, computer science degrees, with their emphasis on fundamentals over the details of programming languages, rise in value over coding boot camps.</p>Will there be a Top Programming Language in 2026? Right now, programming is going through the biggest transformation since compilers broke onto the scene in the early 1950s. Even if the predictions that much of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-index-2025\" target=\"_self\">AI is a bubble</a> about to burst come true, the thing about tech bubbles is that there\u2019s always some residual technology that survives. It\u2019s likely that using LLMs to write and assist with code is something that\u2019s going to stick. So we\u2019re going to be spending the next 12 months figuring out what popularity means in this new age, and what metrics might be useful to measure. What do <em>you</em> think popularity should mean? What metrics do you think we should consider? Let us know in the comments below."

In total, we identify 64 </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming-languages\" target=\"_self\">programming languages</a>.<span> We then weight each data source </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023\" target=\"_self\">to create an overall index of popularity</a><span>, excluding some of the lowest scorers. Below, we describe the sources of data we use to get the measures, and the weighting scheme we use to produce the overall indices.</span></p><p><span>By popularity, we mean we are trying to rank languages that are in active use, including activity from  maintaining legacy systems. We look at three different aspects of popularity: languages in active use among typical IEEE members and working software engineers (the \u201cSpectrum\u201d ranking), languages that are in demand by employers (the \u201cJobs\u201d ranking), and languages that are in the zeitgeist (the \u201cTrending\u201d ranking).</span></p><p><span>We gauged the popularity of languages using the following sources for a total of seven metrics (see below). We gathered the information for all metrics in July\u2014August 2025. In the past we relied heavily on APIs to gather data from sources, but now the data is gathered manually to the difficulty of keeping up with API changes and terminations, and</span><span> because many of the programming language\u2019s names (C++, Scheme) collided with common terms found in research papers and job ads or were difficult for a search engine to parse. When a large number of search results made it impractical to resolve ambiguities by examining all of the results individually, we used a sample of each data source, and determined the relevant sample size based on estimating the true mean with 95 percent confidence. Not all data sources contain information for each programming language and we interpret this information as the programming language having \u201cno hits\u201d (that is, not being popular).</span></p><p><span>The results from each metric are normalized to produce a relative popularity score between 0 and 1. Then the individual metrics are multiplied by a weight factor, combined, and the result renormalized to produce an aggregate popularity score.</span><span>In aggregating metrics, we hope to compensate for statistical quirks that might distort a language\u2019s popularity score in any particular source of data. Varying the weight factors allows us to create the different results for the Spectrum, Jobs, and Trending rankings. We fully acknowledge that, while these weights are subjective, they are based on our understanding of the sources and our prior coverage of software topics. Varying the weight factors allows us to emphasize different types of popularity and produce the different rankings. We then combined each weighted data source for each program and then renormalized the resulting frequency to produce an aggregate popularity score.</span></p><p><span>The Top Programming Languages was originally created by data journalist <a href=\"https://communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/nicholas-diakopoulos.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Diakopoulos</a>. Our statistical methodology advisor is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hilary-wething-52414b10/\" target=\"_blank\">Hilary Wething</a>, although all the actual data gathering and calculation is performed by us. Rankings are computed using <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">R</a>.<br /></span></p><h2>Google</h2><p><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> is the leading search engine in the world, making it an ideal fit for estimating language popularity. We measured the number of hits for each language by searching on the template, \u201cX programming language\u201d (with quotation marks) and manually recorded the number of results that were returned by the search. We took the measurement in July 2025. We like this measure because it indicates the volume of online information resources about each programming language.</span></p><h2>Stack Overflow</h2><p><span><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stack Overflow</a> is a popular site where programmers can ask questions about coding. We recorded the number of questions tagged to each program within the last week prior to our search (August 2025). For the Mathematica/Wolfram language, we relied on the sister <a href=\"https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cStack\u201d for the Mathematica platform</a> and tallied the number of programming-related questions asked in the past week. These data were gathered manually. This measure indicates what programming languages are currently trending.</span></p><h2>IEEE Xplore Digital Library</h2><p>IEEE maintains a <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">digital library</a> with millions of conference and journal articles covering a wide array of scientific and engineering disciplines. We searched for journal, magazine, and early access articles that mention each of the languages in the template \u201cX programming\u201d for the 2025 year-to-date. For search results that returned thousands of articles, we identified the correct sample size for a 95 percent confidence interval (usually a little over 300) and pulled that number of articles. For each language we sampled, we identified the share of articles that utilize the programming language and then multiplied the total number of articles by this share to tally the likely total number of articles that reference a given programming language. We conducted this search in August 2025. This metric captures the prevalence of the different programming languages as used and referenced in engineering <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/scholarship\" target=\"_self\">scholarship.</a></p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/scholarship\" target=\"_self\"></a>IEEE Jobs Site</h2><p>We measured the demand for different programming languages in job postings on the <a href=\"https://jobs.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Job Site</a>. For search results that returned thousands of listings, we identified the correct sample size for a 95 percent confidence interval (usually around 300 results) and pulled that number of job listings to manually examine. For each language we sampled, we identified the share of listings that utilize the programming language and then multiplied the total number of job listings by this share to tally the likely total number of job listings that reference a given programming language. Additionally, because some of the languages we track could be ambiguous in plain text\u2014such as Go, J, Ada, and R\u2014we searched for job postings with those words in the job description and then manually examined the results, again sampling entries if the number of results was large. The search was conducted in August 2025. We like the IEEE Job Site for its large number of non-U.S. listings, making it an ideal to measure global popularity.</p><h2>Career Builder</h2><p>We measured the demand for different programming languages on the <a href=\"https://www.careerbuilder.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CareerBuilder</a> job site. We searched for \u201cDeveloper\u201d jobs offered within the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states\" target=\"_self\">United States</a>, as this is the most popular job title for programmers. We sampled 400 job ads and manually examined them to identify which languages employers mentioned in the postings. The search was conducted in August 2024. We like the career builder site to identify the popularity of programmer jobs among U.S.-based companies</p><h2>GitHub</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> is a public repository for many volunteer-driven open-source software projects. We used <a href=\"https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/programming-languages\" target=\"_blank\">Github\u2019s listing</a> of it\u2019s top 50 programming languages, filtering out entries for things like <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker configuration scripts</a>. <span>The data cover the first quarter of 2025. This measured provides a strong indication what languages coders choose to work in when they have a personal choice.</span></p><h2>Trinity College Dublin Library</h2><p>The<a href=\"https://www.tcd.ie/library/\" target=\"_blank\"> library of Trinity College Dublin</a> is one of six legal deposit libraries in Ireland and the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-kingdom\" target=\"_self\">United Kingdom</a>. A copy must be deposited with the library of any printed material published or distributed in Ireland, and on request any U.K. publisher or distributor must also deposit a book. We searched for all books published in the year to date that matched the names of programming languages and checked the results for false positives. The search was conducted in July 2025. We like this library collection because it represents a large and categorized sample of works, primarily in the English language.</p><h2>Discord</h2><p>Discord is popular chat-room platform where many programmers exchange information. We counted the number of tags that correspond to each language. In the case of languages that could also be names of nonprogramming topics (many nonprogramming-related topics also have dedicated Discord <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/servers\" target=\"_self\">servers</a>; for example, \u201cJulia\u201d could refer to the <a href=\"https://julialang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">programming language</a> or the <a href=\"https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Julia\" target=\"_blank\">Sesame Street puppet</a>), results were manually examined. <a href=\"https://disboard.org/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Disboard</a> was searched in August 2025. Disboard lists many public discord servers and many young coders use the site, contributing a different demographic of coders.</p>"

Here the quartz will be mixed with dehydrated wood chips and heated to 1,500 to 2,000 \u00b0C in a trio of electric-arc furnaces that use massive electrodes <a href=\"https://pyrometallurgy.co.za/InfaconVIII/389-Javier.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">invented at this plant in the 1990s</a>. Inside the furnace, a reaction takes place that rips the oxygen from the silica and sticks it to the carbon from the wood. The result is silicon metal and carbon monoxide.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>Fact:</strong> 3.8 million tonnes of silicon metal was produced in 2023, according to the <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-silicon.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Geological Survey</a>.</p><h3>3.

It will need to be at least 99.9999999 percent pure to become a microprocessor, which will require some pretty powerful chemistry. So it\u2019s off to <a href=\"https://www.wacker.com/cms/en-us/products/product-groups/polysilicon/polysilicon.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wacker Chemie</a>, in Burghausen, Germany. Here, the metal undergoes what\u2019s called the Siemens process: It\u2019s bathed in hydrochloric acid and reacts to form hydrogen gas and a liquid called trichlorosilane. Any impurities will be in the liquid, which is then run through a multistep distillation process that separates the pure trichlorosilane from anything unwanted. Once the needed purity is reached, the reaction is reversed: At 1,150 \u00b0C, the trichlorosilane is reacted with hydrogen to deposit multiple crystals of silicon, called polysilicon, and the resulting hydrochloric acid gas is sucked away. The polysilicon forms thick rods around heating elements. Once it\u2019s cooled and removed from the reaction chamber, the polysilicon is smashed up for shipping.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>Fact:</strong> According to consultant <a href=\"https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/global-polysilicon-production-capacity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thunder Said Energy</a>, 1.7 million tonnes of polysilicon was produced in 2024, most of that for solar-cell production.</p><h3>4. Silicon Wafers</h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of silicon ingot growth from molten polysilicon at 1,425\\u00b0C.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7688b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-silicon-ingot-growth-from-molten-polysilicon-at-1425-u00b0c.png?id=61622784&amp;width=980\" /><p>The ultrapure silicon is made up of many crystals at different orientations. But microprocessors must be made from a single crystal. So the material might migrate to Sherman, Texas, where GlobalWafers recently opened a US $3.5 billion silicon-wafer plant. Here the polysilicon is put through what\u2019s called the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/modern-civilization-relies-on-this-crystalgrowing-method\" target=\"_self\">Czochralski (Cz) method</a>. In a high-purity quartz crucible, the polysilicon is heated to about 1,425 \u00b0C and melts. Then a seed crystal with a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/silicon-crystal\" target=\"_self\">precise crystal orientation</a> is dipped into the melt, slowly drawn upwards, and rotated. Do all that <em><em>exactly</em></em> right, and you will pull up an ingot of pure, crystalline silicon that\u2019s 300 millimeters across and several meters tall. Specialized saws then slice this pillar of semiconducting purity into wafers less than 1 millimeter thick. The wafers are cleaned, polished, and sometimes further processed, before heading to wafer fabs.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>Fact: </strong>According to industry association SEMI, manufacturers have shipped nearly 43 million square meters of silicon wafers in the last five years.

It\u2019s an exceedingly intricate process, involving some of the most complex and expensive equipment on the planet, including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/high-na-euv\" target=\"_self\">EUV lithography systems</a> that can cost upward of $300 million each. In Fab 18, each wafer will go through months of exquisitely precise torture to produce the transistors and wiring that make up the processors. Extreme ultraviolet radiation will print patterns onto it, hot ions will ram into its surface, precision chemical reactions will build up some parts one atomic layer at a time, acids will etch away nanometer-scale structures, and metals will electrochemically plate parts and be polished away in others. The result: a wafer full of identical processors.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><strong>Fact: </strong>The maximum size of a silicon die is 858 mm<sup>2</sup>. Within a chip, there are more than 160 kilometers of wiring. Apple\u2019s M3 Max processor contains 92 billion transistors.</p><h3>6. Packaged Chips</h3><br /><img alt=\"Visual of chip wafer layers, emphasizing a single chip labeled &quot;A11&quot;.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"68053\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/visual-of-chip-wafer-layers-emphasizing-a-single-chip-labeled-a11.png?id=61622786&amp;width=980\" /><p>As amazing as these processors are, you can\u2019t use them in this form. They first need to be packaged.

A package provides the chip with mechanical protection, a way for heat to be removed, and a way of connecting the chip\u2019s micrometer-scale parts to a circuit board\u2019s millimeter-scale ones. To do this, the wafers are first diced into chips. Then tiny balls of solder, some only tens of micrometers across, are attached to the chips. The solder bumps are aligned to corresponding parts of the package, and the two parts are melted together. It\u2019s becoming more common for multiple pieces of silicon to be integrated within the same package, either stacked on top of each other or positioned next to each other on a separate piece of silicon called an interposer.

This reactor uses electrical current to separate oxygen from metals (such as iron, aluminum, and silicon) without water, toxic chemicals, or carbon emissions. The silicon can then be refined to produce radiation-resistant solar cells, while the elemental oxygen can be converted into oxygen gas, fuel cells, or liquid oxygen (LOX) propellant. The metals and ceramics can also be used as building materials for habitat structures, and to create semiconductors for electric systems.</p><p>This process reduces reliance on supplies launched from Earth. It also has potential applications here on Earth, where carbon-neutral manufacturing can ensure sustainable development. In a company <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/news/blue-alchemist-hits-major-milestone-toward-permanent-sustainable-lunar-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>, Pat Remias, the vice president of Blue Origin\u2019s Advanced Concepts and Enterprise Engineering said, <span>\u201cBlue Alchemist changes everything about how we approach space. It is the foundation for a sustainable robotic and human presence across the solar system. Each kilogram of oxygen we make on the lunar surface is one less that we have to launch from Earth, making it a giant leap toward permanent settlements as well as critical resources for transportation to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\u201d </span></p><p><span>The company also indicates that it\u2019s on track to scale the system to make lunar landings up to 60 percent cheaper and reduce fuel-cell and battery masses by up to 70 percent by enabling lunar refueling services. The system is being developed at Blue Origin\u2019s Space Resources Center of Excellence, a 1.2-hectare facility with 5,575 square meters of lab space that is staffed by a team of 65 interdisciplinary experts.

The new smartphones will also ship with the latest operating system and its \u201cLiquid Glass\u201d software design\u2014but the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/license-to-spill\" target=\"_self\">liquid</a> in these phones goes beyond software. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-unveils-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max</a> contain thin, hermetically sealed chambers with a drop of water inside that cycles between liquid and gas to help dissipate heat. Known as vapor chambers, the cooling system is becoming more common in smartphones built for sustained high performance. Some high-end <a href=\"https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/How-does-Vapor-Cooling-Technology-work-when-your-Galaxy-heats-up/td-p/20547538\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Galaxy</a> and <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/09/10/pixel-9-pro-vapor-chamber/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Pixel</a> models, among others, have introduced vapor-chamber cooling in the past few years. Now, Apple is following their lead. </p><p>\u201cCooling of smaller portables like phones must focus on spreading heat as widely as possible to the surface of the device, with particular attention to heat-generating components, like the chip,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/kenneth-goodson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kenneth Goodson</a>, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford who specializes in heat transfer and energy conversion. To cool down those hot spots, the industry seems to be moving toward vapor chambers and other phase-change technology. <strong></strong></p><h2>How vapor chambers keep phones cool</h2><p>The standard approach to cooling smartphones uses a solid, highly conductive plate made from a material like copper to spread heat. This approach relies on having a surface where heat can spread. Sometimes, fins are added to extend that surface, but this can lead to a thicker device.<strong> </strong>Most companies, however, are intent on making thinner and thinner phones. </p><p>Phase-change technology\u2014which has been used in laptops for decades, Goodson notes\u2014achieves the same goal more effectively with fluid that boils and condenses to dissipate heat. These two-phase solutions include vapor chambers, like those used in the new iPhone, as well as narrow, fingerlike structures called <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/superslim-liquid-loop-will-keep-future-smartphones-cool\" target=\"_self\">heat pipes</a>. </p><p>Phones have limited volume to work with, and \u201cperformance per volume is critical,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.globalcoolingtechnologygroup.com/victor-chiriac-co-founder-ceo-and-managing-director-251219\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Victor Chiriac</a>, the CEO and cofounder of Global Cooling Technology Group, based in Phoenix. Thin and wide vapor chambers have a high heat-removal capacity and offer an effective solution. The cycle between liquid and vapor is \u201ca powerful mechanism for absorbing heat,\u201d he says.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A animated gif showing water flowing through a sealed chamber of an Apple iPhone 17.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"77c42\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-animated-gif-showing-water-flowing-through-a-sealed-chamber-of-an-apple-iphone-17.gif?id=61605070&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Apple\u2019s vapor chamber efficiently spreads heat across the phone\u2019s body.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Apple</small></p><p>In Apple\u2019s version, a small amount of deionized water is sealed in the chamber. The water evaporates when near heat sources, then condenses back into a liquid when the heat dissipates into the phone\u2019s surrounding aluminum body. Water is often used in vapor chambers, though sometimes other materials are mixed in to prevent it from freezing and cracking the seal, Chiriac says. </p><h2>Vapor-chamber manufacturing faces challenges</h2><p>As Apple, Samsung, and others push the boundaries of how thin phones can get, manufacturing vapor chambers may become a challenge. While solid materials can easily be shaved down, these chambers need to have enough space for coolant to travel through channels. The chambers have to be perfectly sealed in order to work properly, and \u201cthe thinner you make it, the less space you have for that secret sauce to do its thing,\u201d Chiriac says. </p><p>It comes down to physics: \u201cA big challenge in small devices like phones is that as you scale down the thickness of a vapor chamber, the fluid physics aggressively scale back their performance relative to copper and other solid heat conductors,\u201d Goodson explains. (This is a problem that researchers, including <a href=\"https://nanoheat.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">his students</a>, are working to address with new microstructures.) Plus, vapor chambers tend to be expensive to manufacture. </p><p>Still, Apple and other companies have decided to invest in this technology for their most powerful phone models. Goodson suspects part of that decision is to leverage the \u201cwow\u201d factor. But, he says, \u201cwith time this approach will likely become an industry standard.\u201d</p>"
