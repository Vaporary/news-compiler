Our analysis reveals three key findings. First, China\u2019s policymaking has historically been highly decentralized, with local bureaucrats playing crucial roles in both creating new policies and spreading them. Second, since 2013, policymaking has become substantially more centralized, driven primarily by changing bureaucratic incentives\u2014bottom-up innovation is no longer rewarded, while strict enforcement of central policies is. Third, our examination of industrial policies shows that centralization affects both policy suitability and effectiveness. Top-down industrial policies tend to align poorly with local conditions and are less effective at driving industrial growth, highlighting centralization\u2019s costs. On the other hand, under decentralization, competition among local officials can distort policy diffusion, also undermining effectiveness. Our quantitative assessment of both distortions indicates that economic costs of centralizing policymaking in China have significantly outweighed its benefits."

        "summary": "This chapter explores the distinctive trajectory of American industrialization up to 1870, emphasizing how the United States adapted and transformed British technologies to suit its unique economic and resource conditions. Rather than a straightforward transfer of innovations, the chapter argues that American industrial development was shaped by path-dependent processes and historical contingencies\u2014such as the Embargo Act of 1807 and government sponsorship of firearms production\u2014that enabled the emergence of a domestic innovation ecosystem. The chapter offers fresh insights into how high-pressure steam engines, vertically integrated textile mills, and precision manufacturing techniques evolved in response to labor scarcity, capital constraints, and abundant natural resources. A particularly novel contribution is the detailed analysis of how American manufacturers substituted mechanization and organizational innovation for skilled labor, leading to the development of technologies that were not only distinct from their British counterparts but also foundational for the Second Industrial Revolution. The chapter also highlights the democratization of invention, showing how economic incentives and institutional support fostered widespread innovation among ordinary citizens. By integrating technological, economic, and institutional perspectives, this chapter provides a compelling explanation for why the United States developed a robust manufacturing sector despite seemingly unfavorable initial conditions."

Applying it to the U.S. patent examination process, we find that, ceteris paribus, applications from female inventors are 1.8 percentage points less likely to be approved, and those from Black inventors are 3 percentage points less likely\u2014inconsistent with legally prescribed criteria. Jointly studying multiple bias dimensions and their intersections for the first time, we uncover new biases, including an affiliation bias\u2014individual inventors are disadvantaged by 6.6 percentage points relative to employees of large, public firms, a disparity larger than any demographic gap. Moreover, innovation quality, location, and other factors can mitigate or compound discrimination, and the disparities interact: for example, racial gaps vanish among public-firm employees, masking more severe discrimination against individuals. Existing theories such as homophily cannot fully explain the results, but a simple model of correlation neglect does."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve partially \"looked through\" the post-Covid rise in inflation and ultimately managed to bring about an \"immaculate disinflation.\" The Fed's policy deviated strongly from the Taylor rule during this period. More generally, central banks with strong inflation-fighting credentials looked through post-Covid inflationary shocks yet experienced less inflation than more hawkish but less credible central banks. In light of this episode, we assess the degree to which the Taylor rule is descriptive, and the degree to which it should be viewed as prescriptive. While the Taylor rule (generally) fits well during the Greenspan period, it (generally) fits poorly in the early 1980s and after the early 2000s. Academic work has emphasized the role of the Taylor rule in preventing self-fulfilling fluctuations (guaranteeing determinacy). These concerns can be addressed with a shock-contingent commitment and are fragile to deviations from fully rational expectations. We discuss three reasons why optimal policy may not always imply a one-for-one response of interest rates to inflation (forward guidance, correlated shocks, and \"long and variable lags\"). The main challenge arising from such policies is not indeterminacy but erosion of inflation-fighting credibility and potential deanchoring of long-run inflation expectations. Only central banks with strongly anchored inflation expectations and large amounts of inflation-fighting credibility are likely to be able to look through inflationary shocks."

We adapt the PAL implementation for scalability by integrating it into public school schedules, and experimentally evaluate this adaptation in a more representative sample over 20 times larger than the original study. After 18 months, treated students scored 0.22\u03c3 higher in Mathematics and 0.20\u03c3 higher in Hindi, a 50\u201366% productivity increase over the control group. Learning gains were proportional to student time on the platform, providing a simple, low-cost metric for monitoring implementation quality in future scale-ups.

While the United States has remained a leading destination for international students, recent years have seen a plateau or decline in incoming students, contrasted by growth in countries like Canada, Australia, and emerging hubs such as China and India. International students, particularly in STEM fields, play a critical role in shaping host countries' innovation ecosystems, often transitioning to permanent residents and STEM workers. We review immigration policies, including post-graduation work and residency pathways, highlighting their varying impacts on student inflows and innovation. Policies in Canada and Australia have until recently eased these transitions, while restrictive measures in the U.S. and U.K. have posed challenges. By documenting these trends and policy shifts, we identify gaps in the literature and outline directions for future research at the intersection of international education, immigration, and innovation."

We study this question in the context of Brazilian agriculture and the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu\u00e1ria (Embrapa), a public research corporation established in 1973 to develop locally suitable science and technology. First, we show that Embrapa redirected research toward prioritized staple crops and local ecological conditions, and increased research productivity, especially in remote and research-scarce regions. Second, exploiting the staggered rollout of research centers alongside heterogeneous local exposure to Embrapa\u2019s technology development, we find that Embrapa significantly increased agricultural output, driven both by higher productivity and expanded input use. Combined with a model, these estimates imply that public R&amp;D investment increased national agricultural productivity by 110% with a benefit-cost ratio of 17. The decentralized structure, in which research labs were spread across many ecological zones instead of in a single hub, explains a large share of these benefits."

        "summary": "How does being over- or underqualified at the beginning of a worker's career affect skill acquisition, retention, and promotion? Despite the importance of mismatch for the labor market, self-selection into jobs has made estimating these effects difficult. We overcome endogeneity concerns in the context of the US Air Force, which allocates new enlistees to over 130 different jobs based, in part, on test scores. Using these test scores, we create simulated job assignments based on factors outside of an individual's control: the available slots in upcoming training programs and the quality of other recruits entering at the same time. These factors create quasi-random variation in job assignment and hence how cognitively demanding an individual's job is relative to their own ability. We find that being overqualified for a job causes higher attrition, both during technical training and afterward when individuals are working in their assigned jobs. It also results in more behavioral problems, worse performance evaluations, and lower scores on general knowledge tests about the military taken by all workers. On the other hand, overqualification results in better performance relative to others in the same job: job-specific test scores rise both during technical training and while on the job, and these individuals are more likely to be promoted. Combined, these patterns suggest that overqualified individuals are less motivated, but still outperform others in their same job. Underqualification results in a polar opposite set of findings, suggesting these individuals are motivated to put forth more effort, but still struggle to compete when judged relative to others. Consistent with differential incentives, individuals who are overqualified are in jobs which are less valuable in terms of outside earnings potential, while the reverse is true for those who are underqualified."

        "summary": "This paper uses labor force surveys from 160 countries to build a new microdatabase on hours worked covering 97% of the world population in cross section. We also construct time series spanning over 20 years in 86 countries. Hours worked per adult are slightly bell-shaped with GDP per capita but weakly correlated with development overall. Hours worked by the young (aged 15-19) and elderly (aged 60+) decline with development, driven by growing school attendance and public pension coverage. Hours worked among prime-age adults (aged 20-59) are mildly bell-shaped with development for men while they are increasing for women. The fall in male hours in middle-to-higher income countries is driven by reduced hours per worker and is offset by increases in female labor force participation. These two forces have exactly compensated each other in many countries, leading to a remarkable long-run stability of prime-age hours worked. Labor taxes are strongly negatively correlated with prime-age hours worked both in international comparisons and overtime within countries. Controlling for government transfers only partly reduces the link between labor taxes and prime-age hours, ruling out substitution and income effects on labor supply as the only driver. Controlling for working hours regulations and the size of the formal sector eliminates this link, suggesting that regulations also play a large role in reducing intensive hours in higher-income countries."

        "summary": "College loans serve as a double-edged sword for human capital investment: While they facilitate access to education, the burden of repayment may distort post-education investments in human capital. We examine the role of college loans and loan repayment policies through a structural model in which heterogeneous individuals, faced with borrowing limits, make dynamic decisions on consumption, borrowing/saving, labor supply, and costly human capital investment (via both college education and on-the-job learning a la Ben-Porath (1967)). We estimate two versions of the model using data from the NLSY79: one with natural borrowing limits and another with parameterized limits. Counterfactual simulations based on both models suggest that, relative to the standard fixed repayment plan, income-driven repayment (IDR) plans modestly increase educational attainment, lifetime earnings, and individual welfare. Although some generous IDR plans may result in losses for the loan program itself, overall government revenue is higher under IDRs than under the standard repayment plan when lifetime income taxes are accounted for, creating a win-win scenario for both individual welfare and government revenue."

In this paper, we show that these missing incentives yield quantitatively significant underinvestment in research and development. We develop a simple model that formalizes the conditions under which such missing markets for innovation arise. We identify an empirical setting\u2014research into new uses for existing drugs\u2014in which there is sharp variation in the enforceability of intellectual property rights on otherwise comparable inventions over time. We show that when intellectual property rights become unenforceable, research investment and commercialization nearly cease. In doing so, we test two claims central both to our model and the innovation literature more generally\u2014that stronger intellectual property protection does, in fact, induce investment, and that heterogeneity in the availability of these rights distorts investment. The welfare consequences of inadequate incentives in our empirical context are large. Our estimates suggest that 200-800 new uses for existing drugs would have been developed under counterfactual policies. Measures of the value of these uses drawn from existing literature suggest that the social cost of this particular missing market is on the order of several trillion dollars."

These days, however, blockchain is most famous as the tool enabling <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money?utm_campaign=post-teaser&amp;utm_content=ibfuflhf\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies</a>.

Every time a cryptocurrency transaction is initiated, all parties involved in the transaction need to securely prove that they agree to the transfer. This is done via a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\" target=\"_blank\">digital signature</a>: a cryptographic protocol that generates a secret, private key that is unique to each user and a public key that the user shares. Then, the private key is used to generate a unique signature for each transaction. The public key can be used to verify that, indeed, the signature was created by the holder of the private key. In this way, Web3 in every incarnation relies heavily on cryptography. </span></p><p><span>To learn more about the evolution of Web3, and cryptography\u2019s role, we caught up with</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://wahby.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Riad Wahby</a><span>, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, and a cofounder and CEO of hardware-backed Web3 security platform </span><a href=\"https://cubist.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Cubist</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> Wahby explained what Web3 was meant to be, what it\u2019s become, and how hardware-backed cryptography will enable its future.<br /></span></p><h3>Web3 Began as a Response to What Came Before</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: What is Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Riad Wahby:</strong> That\u2019s the hardest question that you\u2019re going to ask by far, because I don\u2019t know how to answer it in a way that satisfies everyone.</p><p>The term Web3 was coined around 2018, by people who looked at the way that the Web had developed. Web 1.0 was the first Web bubble, the dot-com bubble. Web 2.0, roughly speaking, is Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Apple and Netflix, and the like. And the perception, especially from folks who originally coined this term Web3, was that these companies had basically taken the Web in the wrong direction, because your privacy is gone, and you\u2019re the product, so to speak. You use Gmail for free because Google is mining your emails to sell things like better advertising. Web3 was originally a reaction to this. Early proponents of Web3 basically said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. We want to take back control of our stuff. I want to own my own data, and maybe cryptocurrencies and blockchains are the way there.\u201d So that\u2019s where the term originally came from.</p><p><strong>What does the term mean now?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Now it doesn\u2019t mean anything like that at all. Now Web3 is the broader ecosystem around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. And I think basically all of that revolutionary spirit has gone away in favor of building financial products and making a lot of money doing it. As far as I can tell, the term has really transformed from a reaction to a lack of privacy and a lack of sovereignty in my own data to \u201cHey, this is a technology that has something to do with blockchains.\u201d Maybe you can buy some kind of speculative meme coin and make a bunch of money doing it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe that took a dark turn at the end. That\u2019s how things go.</p><p><strong>How are those two definitions connected?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Cryptography really fits into the revolutionary spirit, in the sense that the folks who want to cast off the chains of things like Google and Facebook, one of the tenets was\u2014\u201dThe way that we\u2019ll do that is we\u2019ll build this technology that\u2019s sort of amazing and that gives us all these great properties.\u201d And they were going to do that using some advanced cryptographic technologies. This is the reason that there\u2019s so many people who are cryptography researchers at universities that also are involved deeply in some kind of cryptocurrency. Because it\u2019s like this is a sea change in the way that cryptography gets used in the world.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it used to be that if you were working on really any kind of cryptography, regardless of how theoretical or how practical you intended it to be, you knew that there was not much of a chance that any of it was going to get really used in the world, unless it was extremely practical and extremely focused on solving some immediate problem. And it just used to be the case that people were extremely conservative about what kind of cryptography they used. Basically, everyone thought, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of this crazy stuff. That\u2019s all theory. Nobody cares. The only stuff we need is what lets you connect to Amazon and safely buy stuff.\u201d The rise of cryptocurrencies brought with it this whole shift in the way that cryptography gets deployed in the world, where now if you can come up with some interesting functionality that\u2019s enabled by some advanced cryptography, probably somewhere somebody is going to try and turn that into a product that they can sell.</p><h3>Web3 Is Both Good and Bad for Cryptography</h3><p><strong>What effect has this had on the cryptographic community?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> It\u2019s both good and bad. It\u2019s good in that this means that there\u2019s a lot of motivation to build interesting, cool stuff. And as a researcher in cryptography, I love it because it means that there\u2019s tons more research money being poured into cryptography.</p><p>That\u2019s the good side. The bad side is that the reason that people were so conservative about deploying new cryptography is that it\u2019s easy to get the security mechanism wrong. The default state of cryptography is [to assume everything is] broken. You have to be very, very careful that each change that you make isn\u2019t returning your cryptography to the default state. I\u2019m not saying that people in Web3 aren\u2019t careful. They are. It\u2019s just by the nature of things, since it\u2019s a much faster time frame, there\u2019s much more pressure to just push stuff into production. And I think the downside is that we have seen a little bit of brokenness. It\u2019s hopefully not causing people to lose oodles of money. And I think the historical record bears this out: People lose oodles of money because other people are really dishonest, not because the cryptography is broken for the most part. But the cryptography can also be broken, and that can also be worrisome. But I\u2019d say from the perspective of somebody who\u2019s doing research in cryptography, the impact of Web3 on the cryptographic community has generally been a good thing.</p><p><strong>Now you\u2019re focused on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip\" target=\"_blank\">hardware security</a>. Can you explain what that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Any cryptocurrency has this property that if I hold some token, and I want to send it to somebody else, the way that I do that is by producing a digital signature that says, I want to spend this token. The secret key is what lets you generate a signature. So if you have 10 <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-merge-heralds-cryptos-climate-friendly-future\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> [cryptocurrency coins], and they\u2019re all protected by this key, and somebody takes a copy of your key, then life is bad.</p><p>With a digital signature key it could just be sitting on your hard drive, and then you get some malware, and now somebody has silently stolen your key. There have been these big, broadly targeted malware campaigns where millions and millions of people have all had their keys stolen. So now the criminals are just like sitting there counting up all the money that they\u2019ve stolen, and there\u2019s no reversing transactions, unlike at a bank.</p><p>Here\u2019s where hardware comes in. This is not really a Web3 technology, this is kind of old, good stuff. There are these devices called hardware security modules, and they\u2019ve been used for multiple decades. This is a physical device, and this device can run certain cryptographic algorithms. And it knows enough that when you tell it, \u201cHey, please generate me a key,\u201d it can generate you a key securely. And when you tell it, \u201cPlease give me a signature,\u201d it can give you a signature securely. But the important thing is the way that it\u2019s designed, the key never leaves this piece of hardware. It turns what was a piece of data into a physical object. And we know how to secure a physical object.</p><p><strong>You\u2019re working on extending hardware security for more use cases. Can you explain what you\u2019re doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> There are two issues with the standard hardware security module.</p><p>No. 1, you need more cryptography support, so you need to be able to apply digital signatures to transactions very quickly if you\u2019re actively trading. And No. 2, you need a way of expressing that it\u2019s not just a key that can generate any signature. It\u2019s a key that also has attached to it some kind of policy that says these are the kinds of signatures that are okay to generate, and everything else is not allowed, to add extra security. These are the two directions that we have that our technology enables within traditional hardware security modules.</p><p>We start with the security that\u2019s provided by the traditional hardware security module, and we extend it using this, actually another piece of trusted hardware called the Trusted Execution Environment. We extend it to support the actual kinds of cryptography that are needed for Web3 and to support this rich programmable policy layer that lets you say, \u201cThis key is only intended for this specific kind of use,\u201d or \u201canytime somebody tries to make a payment from this key, first I have to check whether the recipient is subject to sanctions,\u201d or any other rule. So in the end, we have, not only a hardware security module, we have also this Trusted Execution Environment and this policy layer, and all this other cryptographic stuff that together gives us a hardware security module that\u2019s really designed for the Web3 use case.</p>"

Usually, they want to write an article for us. But one bold query I received in January 2024 went much further: An undergraduate engineering student named <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatosin-kolade/?originalSubdomain=ng\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oluwatosin Kolade</a>, from Obafemi Awolowo University, in Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300, Nigeria, volunteered to be our robotics editor. </p><p>Kolade\u2014Tosin to his friends\u2014had been the newsletter editor for his IEEE student branch, but he\u2019d never published an article professionally. His earnestness and enthusiasm were endearing. I explained that we already have a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/evan-ackerman\" target=\"_self\">robotics editor</a>, but I\u2019d be glad to work with him on writing, editing, and ultimately publishing an article. </p><p> Back in 2003, I had met plenty of engineering students when I traveled to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/surf-africa\" target=\"_self\">Nigeria to report </a>on the SAT-3/WASC cable, the first undersea fiber-optic cable to land in West Africa. I remember seeing students gathering around obsolete PCs at Internet caf\u00e9s connected to the world via a satellite dish powered by a generator. I challenged Tosin to tell <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> readers what it\u2019s like for engineering students today. The result is \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stem-education-in-africa\" target=\"_blank\">Lessons from a Janky Drone</a>.\u201d</p><p>I decided to complement Tosin\u2019s piece with the perspective of a more established engineer in sub-Saharan Africa. I reached out to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/g-pascal-zachary\" target=\"_self\">G. Pascal Zachary</a>, who has covered engineering education in Africa for us, and Zachary introduced me to <a href=\"https://ibaino.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Engineer Bainomugisha</a>, a computer science professor at Makerere University, in Kampala, Uganda. In \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/africa-engineering-hardware\" target=\"_blank\">Learning More With Less</a>,\u201d Bainomugisha draws out the things that were common to his and Tosin\u2019s experience and suggests ways to make the hardware necessary for engineering education more accessible.</p><p>In fact, the region\u2019s decades-long struggle to develop its engineering talent hinges on access to the three things we focus on in this issue: reliable electricity, ubiquitous broadband, and educational resources for young engineers.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cDuring my weekly video calls with Tosin...the connection was pretty good\u2014 except when it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p><span>Zachary\u2019s article in this issue, \u201c</span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/electricity-access-sub-saharan-africa\" target=\"_blank\">What It Will Really Take to Electrify All of Africa</a><span>\u201d</span><span> tackles the first topic, with a focus on an ambitious initiative to bring electricity to an additional 300 million people by 2030.</span></p><p> Contributing editor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/lucas-laursen\" target=\"_self\">Lucas Laursen</a>\u2019s article, \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/broadband-internet-in-nigeria\" target=\"_blank\">In Nigeria, Why Isn\u2019t Broadband Everywhere?</a>\u201d investigates the slow rollout of fiber-optic connectivity in the two decades since my first visit. As he learned when he traveled to Nigeria earlier this year, the country now has eight undersea cables delivering 380 terabits of capacity, yet less than half of the population has broadband access. </p><p>I got a sense of Nigeria\u2019s bandwidth issues during my weekly video calls with Tosin to discuss his article. The connection was pretty good, except when it wasn\u2019t. Still, I reminded myself, two decades ago such calls would have been nearly impossible. </p><p>Through those weekly chats, we established a professional connection, which made it that much more meaningful when I got to meet Tosin in person this past May at the <a href=\"https://2025.ieee-icra.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE ICRA robotics conference</a>, in Atlanta. Tosin was attending thanks to a scholarship from the <a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</a>. Like a kid in a candy shop, he kibbutzed with fellow scholarship winners, attended talks, checked out robots, and met the engineers who built them. </p><p>As Tosin embarks on the next leg in his career journey, he is supported by the IEEE community, which not only recognizes his promise but gives him access to a network of professionals who can help him and his cohort realize their potential.</p>"

But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lutnick\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> claimed that Natcast doesn\u2019t meet certain legal requirements, and therefore the contract, inked less than a week before Donald J. Trump took office for the second time, is illegal. </p><p>Several NSTC proponents whom <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> spoke to are concerned that the move could squander U.S. semiconductor leadership in the long term. The goal of the NSTC, those involved say, is to make gains in semiconductors from the CHIPS Act durable through continued advances. </p><h2>Semiconductor Workforce Development</h2><p>Since its establishment, Natcast has been working to bring up three <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nstc\" target=\"_self\">key centers to execute those functions</a>. In Silicon Valley, it\u2019s established a workforce-development and design-enablement center. In New York, it opened a center for<a href=\"https://natcast.org/grand-opening-nstc-euv-accelerator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> extreme-ultraviolet lithography for cutting-edge chipmaking</a>. And in Arizona, it plans to build a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/third-chips-for-america-rd-flagship-facility-announced\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">prototyping and packaging facility</a>. The centers are intended to help startups and other companies more easily bridge the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-electronics\" target=\"_self\">lab-to-fab gap</a> that currently prevents new technologies from making it into commercial products.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cThere were people from day one\u2026who viewed [Natcast] as very much a political entity and wanted to undo it.\u201d </p><p>The CHIPS Act requires that the NSTC be operated as a \u201cpublic private-sector consortium with participation from the private sector\u201d instead of by a government agency. During the Biden administration, the Commerce Department created Natcast to fill that role, deliberately setting it up in a way to help maintain its independence from political interference. </p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Natcast-CEO-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">public letter</a> to Natcast CEO <a href=\"https://natcast.org/deirdre-hanford-ceo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deirdre Hanford</a>, Lutnick cast the actions of Hanford, her staff, and the volunteer advisors involved in the organization\u2019s creation as giving \u201cthe appearance of impropriety\u201d and flouting \u201cfederal law.\u201d \u201cFrom the very beginning Natcast served as a semiconductor slush fund that did nothing but line the pockets of Biden loyalists with American tax dollars,\u201d he said in a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/department-commerce-takes-action-against-biden-administrations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>.</p><p><em><em>Spectrum</em></em> sought additional comment from the Commerce Department and from Natcast but did not receive a reply by press time.</p><p>Very little funding has actually been delivered, sources say, in part because Commerce has held up its dispersal. (Despite this, NSTC does have a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jay-lewis-1108361_natcast-nist-natcast-activity-7362847657897205761-tEE3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAolpgBG1d7OiKsbIW43dxd6SSv0dyPEgA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of accomplishments</a>.) Lutnick\u2019s legal argument for refusing payment now is that Natcast wasn\u2019t established in accordance with the Government Corporation Control Act, which lays out how government agencies establish or purchase corporations. </p><p>One person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named says that the structure of Natcast is typical of public\u2013private partnerships and that its underpinnings were thoroughly reviewed by the Commerce Department before its establishment. What\u2019s really at issue, this person says, is Natcast\u2019s independence.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhat was set up\u2026was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026.

Targeting such people is concerning, says one expert who preferred not to be named, because chip experts who choose to work in government or at Natcast are usually giving up more lucrative work to serve their country. It has the effect of \u201cpunishing patriotic behavior,\u201d the expert said.</p><p>Delaying the work of the NSTC by attacking Natcast is counterproductive for the U.S. chip industry, the expert added. \u201cWe are in a race, and these delays make it all the more urgent.\u201d</p><p>Commerce will likely find some way to spend the money on semiconductor R&amp;D eventually, sources agreed. One expert told <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> they have faith in NIST\u2019s ability to administer the research funding. Mark Granahan, an early proponent of the CHIPS Act and CEO of<a href=\"https://idealsemi.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Ideal Semiconductor</a>, in Bethlehem, Penn., went further. \u201cIf the administration has a different tactic but the same goal\u2026 not just independence in semiconductors but leadership\u2026then NIST and other existing infrastructure is capable of handling things,\u201d he said.</p><p>But other sources were skeptical it would have the same impact as Natcast. \u201cWhat was set up\u2026was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind,\u201d said one person. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026.

The timeline is almost <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2020/10/13/eternal-september-modern-impact/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on-the-nose fitting</a>: The widespread access to the Internet AOL\u2019s service brought in the 1990s is associated with a digital phenomenon called the Eternal September. Before AOL allowed broad access to Usenet\u2014a precursor to today\u2019s online discussion forums\u2014most new users appeared each September, when new college students frequently joined the platform. Thanks to AOL, they began showing up daily starting around September 1993.</p><p>The fact that AOL\u2019s dial-up is still active in the first place highlights a truism of technology: Sometimes, the important stuff sticks around well after it\u2019s obsolete.</p><h3>Why AOL is ditching dial-up now</h3><p>It\u2019s no surprise that dial-up has lingered for close to a quarter-century. Despite not having needed a dial-up modem myself since the summer of 2001, I was once so passionate about dial-up that I begged to get a modem for my 13th birthday. Modems are hard to shake, and not just because we fondly remember waiting so long for them to do their thing.</p><p>Originally, the telephone modem was a hack. It was pushed into public consciousness <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Phone_of_Our_Own/4bgvh1lTQwcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA30&amp;printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partly by Deaf users</a> who worked around the phone industry\u2019s monopolistic regulations to develop <a href=\"https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/telephone-and-relay-services/tty-and-tty-relay-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the teletypewriter</a>, a system to communicate over phone lines via text. Along the way, the community invented technologies like the acoustic coupler.</p><p>To make that hack function, modems had to do multiple conversions in real time\u2014from data to audio and back again, in two directions. As I put it in a piece that <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/06/28/teletype-computer-evolution-history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">compared the modem to the telegraph</a>:</p><blockquote>The modem, at least in its telephone-based forms, represents a dance between sound and data. By translating information into an aural signal, then into current, then back into an aural signal, then back into data once again, the modulation and demodulation going on is very similar to the process used with the original telegraph, albeit done manually.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A retro rectangular modem that says U.S. Robotics Sportster 33.6 Faxmoden\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e814a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-retro-rectangular-modem-that-says-u-s-robotics-sportster-33-6-faxmoden.jpg?id=61508670&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Modems like this one from U.S. Robotics work by converting data to audio and back again. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Robotics_33.6K_Modem.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Jphill19/Wikimedia Commons</a></small></p>With telegraphs, the information was input by a person, translated into electric pulses, and received by another person. Modems work the same way, just without human translators. <p>The result of all this back and forth was that modems had to give up a hell of a lot of speed to make this all work. The need to connect over a medium built for audio meant that data was at risk of getting lost over the line. (This is why <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2021/01/06/error-correcting-code-memory-history/\" target=\"_blank\">error correction</a> was an essential part of the modem\u2019s evolution; often data needed to be shared more than once to ensure it got through. Without error correction, dial-up modems would be even slower.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Remember that sound? It marked many users\u2019 first experience getting online.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dudJjUU9Nhs&amp;t=2s\" target=\"_blank\">AdventuresinHD/YouTube</a></small></p><p>Telephone lines were a hugely inefficient system for data because they were built for voice and heavily compressed audio. Voices are still clear and recognizable after being compressed, but audio compression can wreak havoc on data connections. </p><p>Plus, there was the problem of line access. With a call, you could not easily share a connection. That meant you couldn\u2019t make phone calls while using dial-up, leading to some homes getting a second line. And at the Internet Service Provider level, having multiple lines got very complex, very fast.</p><p>The phone industry knew this, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/01/12/isdn-history-retrospective/\" target=\"_blank\">but its initial solution, ISDN</a>, did not take off among mainstream consumers. (A later one, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/inventor-of-dsl-altered-connectivity\" target=\"_blank\">DSL</a>, had better uptake, and is likely one of the few Internet options rural users currently have.)</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">In some areas of the United States, dial-up remains the best option\u2014the result of decades of poor investment in Internet infrastructure.</p><p>So the industry moved to other solutions to get consumers Internet\u2014<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ethernet-ieee-milestone\" target=\"_blank\">coaxial cable</a>, which was already widespread because of cable TV, and fiber, which wasn\u2019t. The problem is, coax never reached quite as far as telephone wires did, in part because cable television wasn\u2019t technically a utility in the way electricity or water were. </p><p><span>In recent years, many attempts have been made to classify </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/covid19-makes-clear-broadband-access-is-human-right\" target=\"_blank\">Internet access as a public utility</a><span>, though the most recent one was </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5247840/net-neutrality-fcc-struck\" target=\"_blank\">struck down by an appeals court</a><span> earlier this year. </span><span>The public utility regulation is important. The telephone had struggled to reach rural communities in the 1930s, and only did so after a series of regulations, including </span><a href=\"https://www.frs.org/history-rural-telecommunications\" target=\"_blank\">one that led to the creation</a><span> of the Federal Communications Commission, were put into effect. So too did electricity, which </span><a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2020/q1/economic_history\" target=\"_blank\">needed a dedicated law</a><span> to expand its reach.</span></p><p>But the reach of broadband is frustratingly incomplete, as highlighted by the fact that many areas of the country are not properly covered by cellular signals. And getting new wires hung can be an immensely difficult task, in part because companies that sell fiber, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/verizon-nears-the-end-of-fios-builds/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon</a> and Google, often stop investing due to the high costs. (Though, to Google\u2019s credit, <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/blog/2022/08/whats-next-for-google-fiber.html\" target=\"_blank\">it started expanding again in 2022</a> after a six-year rollback.)</p><p>So, in some areas of the United States, dial-up remains the best option\u2014the result of decades of poor investment in Internet infrastructure. This, for years, has propped up companies like AOL, which has evolved numerous times since it foolishly merged with Time Warner a quarter-century ago.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A screenshot showing a 1994 DOS AOL client\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4112a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-showing-a-1994-dos-aol-client.jpg?id=61508672&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The first PC-based client called America Online appeared on the graphical operating system GeoWorks. This screenshot shows the DOS AOL client that was distributed with GeoWorks 2.01.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ernie Smith</small></p><p>But AOL is not the company it was. After multiple acquisitions and spin-outs, it is now a mere subsidiary of Yahoo, and it long ago transitioned into a Web-first property. Oh, it still has <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/products\" target=\"_blank\">subscriptions</a>, but they\u2019re effectively fancy analogues for unnecessary security software. And their email client, while having been defeated by the likes of Gmail years ago, still has its fans. </p><p>When I posted the AOL news on social media, about 90 percent of the responses were jokes or genuine notes of respect. But there was a small contingent, maybe 5 percent, that talked about how much this was going to screw over far-flung communities. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s AOL\u2019s responsibility to keep this model going forever.</p><p>Instead, it looks like the job is going to fall to two companies: Microsoft, whose <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/msn-dial-up-internet-access/CFQ7TTC0KGVG/\" target=\"_blank\">MSN Dial-Up Internet Access</a> costs US $179.95 per year, and the company <a href=\"https://www.unitedonline.net/company/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">United Online</a>, which still operates the longtime dial-up players Juno and NetZero. Satellite Internet is also an option, with older services like HughesNet and newer ones like Starlink picking up the slack.</p><p>It\u2019s not AOL\u2019s fault. But AOL is the face of this failing.</p><h3>AOL dropping dial-up is part of a long fade-out</h3><p>As technologies go, the dial-up modem has not lasted quite as long as the telegram, which has been active in one form or another for 181 years. But the modem, which was first used in 1958 as <a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/about/history/sage-semi-automatic-ground-environment-air-defense-system\" target=\"_blank\">part of an air-defense system</a>, has stuck around for a good 67 years. That makes it one of the oldest pieces of computer-related technology still in modern use.</p><p>To give you an idea of how old that is: 1958 is also the year that the <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2018/01/25/soldering-technology-history/\" target=\"_blank\">integrated circuit</a>, an essential building block of any modern computer, was invented. The disk platter, which became the modern <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2022/02/18/early-hard-drive-history/\" target=\"_blank\">hard drive</a>, was invented a year earlier. The <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/11/17/3m-floppy-disks-history/\" target=\"_blank\">floppy disk</a> came a decade later.</p><p>(It should be noted that the modem itself is not dying\u2014your smartphone has one\u2014but the connection your landline has to your modem, the really loud one, has seen better days.)</p><p>The news that AOL is dropping its service might be seen as the end of the line for dial-up, but the story of the telegram hints that this may not be the case. In 2006, much hay was made about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2006/02/02/5186113/western-union-sends-its-last-telegram\" target=\"_blank\">Western Union sending its final telegram</a>. But Western Union was never the only company sending telegrams, and another company picked up the business. You can still send a telegram via <a href=\"https://itelegram.com\" target=\"_blank\">International Telegram</a> in 2025. (It\u2019s not cheap: A single message, sent the same day, is $34, plus 75 cents per word.)</p><p>In many ways, AOL dropping the service is a sign that this already niche use case is going to get more niche. <span>But niche use cases have a way of staying relevant, given the right audience. It\u2019s sort of like why doctors continue to use pagers. As </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1197955913/doctors-pagers-beepers\" target=\"_blank\">a Planet Money episode</a><span> from two years ago </span>noted<span>, the additional friction of using pagers worked well with the way doctors functioned, because it ensured that they knew the messages they were getting didn\u2019t compete with anything else.</span></p><p>Dial-up is likely never going to totally die, unless the landline phone system itself gets knocked offline, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/12/04/att-eliminate-traditional-landline-copper-phone-service-2029/76765766007/\" target=\"_blank\">which AT&amp;T has admittedly been itching to do</a>. It remains one of the cheapest options to get online, outside of drinking a single coffee at a Panera and logging onto the wifi.</p><p>But AOL? While dial-up may have been the company\u2019s primary business earlier in its life, it hasn\u2019t really been its focus in quite a long time. AOL is now a highly diversified company, whose primary focus over the past 15 years has been advertising. It still sells subscriptions, but those subscriptions are about to lose their most important legacy feature.</p><p>AOL is simply too weak to support the next generation of Internet service themselves. Their inroad to broadband was supposed to be Time Warner Cable; that didn\u2019t work out, so they pivoted to something else, but kept around the legacy business while it was still profitable. It\u2019s likely that emerging technologies, like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/airband-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft\u2019s Airband Initiative</a>, which relies on distributing broadband over unused \u201cwhite spaces\u201d on the television dial, stand a better shot. 5G connectivity will also likely improve over time (T-Mobile <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-brings-5g-home-internet-to-nearly-five-million-more-homes\" target=\"_blank\">already promotes its 5G home Internet</a> as a rural option), and perhaps more satellite-based options will emerge.</p><p>Technologies don\u2019t die. They just slowly become so irrelevant that they might as well be dead.</p><h3>The monoculture of the AOL login experience</h3><p>When I posted the announcement, hidden in an obscure link on the AOL website sent to me by a colleague, it immediately went viral on Bluesky and Mastodon.</p><p>That meant I got to see a lot of people react to this news in real time. Most had the same comment: I didn\u2019t even know it was still around. Others made modem jokes, or talked about AOL\u2019s famously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vO8OpbCvs\" target=\"_blank\">terrible customer service</a>. What was interesting was that most people said roughly the same thing about the service.</p><p>That is not the case with most online experiences, which usually reflect myriad points of views. I think it speaks to the fact that while the Internet was the ultimate monoculture killer, the experience of getting online for the first time was largely monocultural. Usually, it started with a modem connecting to a phone number and dropping us into a single familiar place. <span></span></p><p>We have lost a lot of Internet Service Providers over the years. Few spark the passion and memories of America Online, a network that somehow beat out more innovative and more established players to become the onramp to the Information Superhighway, for all the good and bad that represents.</p><p>AOL must be embarrassed of that history. It barely even announced its closure.</p>"

IPF is a chronic disease that develops when lung tissue becomes too thick, causing permanent scarring in the lungs, according to the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>. The condition makes it hard to breathe. Despite numerous hospital visits and CT scans, her grandfather was diagnosed with the condition too late, leading al-Mahrouqi to want to improve IPF diagnosis methods.</p><p>\u201cRadiologists look for things like tiny, honey-shaped complex sites or faint, hazy areas called ground-glass opacities in the lungs,\u201d al-Mahrouqi says. \u201cThese same patterns also show up in other diseases, like nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and early-stage lung cancer. This often leads to a misdiagnosis.\u201d</p><p>She developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system that uses a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization process, enhancing CT images by amplifying contrast and limiting image grain. Her prototype also uses six different pretrained convolutional neural networks that classify fibrosis patterns and nodule types\u2014malignant, benign, or normal\u2014to provide an earlier diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cThis prototype is unique because it converts classification and enhancement into a single diagnostic tool,\u201d al-Mahrouqi says.

Encased in titanium, the batteries for these devices contained a radioactive isotope\u2014typically about a tenth of a gram of plutonium-238\u2014and could operate for decades without maintenance. The invention provided relief to a population of people who previously needed surgery every few years to change out their pacemaker\u2019s chemical battery.</p><p>As time went on, though, the whereabouts of these radioactive tickers became increasingly difficult to track. In the United States, the devices were supposed to be returned to the U.S. Department of Energy for plutonium recovery. But often, that didn\u2019t happen. Doctors changed jobs, manufacturers went out of business, patients died, and families forgot about their loved one\u2019s pacemaker. Too often, the radioactive material landed in crematoriums and coffins.</p><p>Uncomfortable with the situation, regulators worldwide nixed the devices. The last known nuclear-powered pacemaker was implanted in 1988. After that, aside from a few specialty uses, such as deep-space probes and Siberian lighthouses, development and deployment of nuclear batteries effectively came to a halt.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Two human hands using instruments to manipulate the pieces of a small metal object labeled as radioactive\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cea8b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Medtronic\u2019s 1970 Laurens-Alcatel pulse generator powered pacemakers with plutonium-238. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Smith Collection/Getty Images </small></p><p>Technology never truly dies, and nuclear batteries are no exception. Research <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-daintiest-dynamos\" target=\"_self\">grew active again after 2000</a>, although it lacked commercial translation. But over the last year, a host of companies and research groups around the world have announced advances that they say will invigorate the technology and extend its use to robots, drones, sensors, and solar farms, as well as spacecraft and biomedical implants.</p><p>The new groups are employing modern, more-exotic technology that goes beyond the designs of the past, allowing them to pursue the finest nuclear batteries ever made. As with the first generation, the allure of nuclear batteries is still their extraordinarily long life-spans: several decades and, with proper fuel choice, possibly centuries. They could also deliver more energy in packages that weigh less than those of chemical batteries.</p><p>The question is, who\u2019s going to buy them? I\u2019ve been involved in this sector for nearly 40 years as a nuclear engineer, professor, and consultant. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed: The technology works, it has many advantages over chemical batteries, and it can be utilized safely. But what very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. Part of the problem is that there is no good solution to the need to track these sources and make sure they are disposed of properly at the end of the battery\u2019s life.</p><p>There are more companies working out the challenges now than I\u2019ve ever seen in my career, and that\u2019s good for the field\u2014it helps ground the academic research. And it gives me hope that this could be the moment when nuclear batteries finally flourish.</p><h2>How Do Nuclear Batteries Work?  </h2><p>The term \u201cnuclear batteries\u201d may evoke images of tiny nuclear reactors, but that\u2019s not how they work. Nuclear batteries don\u2019t split atoms with neutron bombardment. Instead, they capture energy in the form of radiation that\u2019s spontaneously released when atomic nuclei decay.</p><p>Most research groups developing nuclear batteries are focused on harnessing energy from radioactive isotopes of nickel and hydrogen. In many nuclear battery designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation released by the radioisotopes\u2019 nuclei and convert it to an electric current, much like a solar cell does. In other designs, thermoelectric devices convert the heat produced by the emitted radiation to electricity. So \u201cradioisotope power source\u201d is a better descriptor than \u201cnuclear battery,\u201d but for ease of language, I\u2019ll use these terms interchangeably.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A coin-shaped metal object displaying a radioactive symbol and other details about its contents \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7d529\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Infinity Power uses a novel electrochemical process to convert the radioactive decay of nickel-63 into electricity. The company says it can scale the technology from microwatts to megawatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Infinity Power </small></p><p>On the heels of some laboratory successes, researchers are racing to commercialize these devices. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority\" target=\"_blank\">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> (UKAEA), Miami-based <a href=\"https://citylabs.net/\" target=\"_blank\">City Labs</a>, Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co., and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nwnu.edu.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">Northwest Normal University</a> have all announced advances and funding in semiconductor-based nuclear batteries over the last two years, some with plans to commercialize. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.infinitypower.energy/\" target=\"_blank\">Infinity Power</a>, in San Diego, announced a novel electrochemical approach to converting radioisotope energy.</p><p>What markets these batteries will find\u2014if they can be commercialized\u2014will depend largely on cost, safety, and licensing issues. One of the most compelling applications is in uncrewed spacecraft for long-distance missions, which require decades of reliable power. Solar power works for missions close to the sun, but by the time a spacecraft gets to Jupiter, the available solar irradiance drops below 4 percent of that on Earth.</p><p>That leaves nuclear fission and radioisotope power as the only viable options for deep-space missions. Fission is ideal for larger power needs in space, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-nuclear-reactor-nasa-moon?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=hero&amp;utm_campaign=2025-08-22&amp;utm_content=hero1\" target=\"_blank\">like NASA\u2019s proposed 100-kilowatt lunar nuclear reactor</a>. But for lower, onboard power needs, nuclear batteries offer simpler designs and lower mass. The current radioisotope workhorse in space is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, which produces a few hundred watts.</p><h2>Radioisotopes: Not Just for Nuclear-Powered Pacemakers </h2><p>NASA\u2019s two Voyager missions, launched in 1977, each carry three RTGs that weigh about 38 kilograms, including 4.5 kg of plutonium-238. They\u2019re cylindrical and about the size of an office wastebasket. They initially produced 157 watts of electric power, but that drops over time as the plutonium-238 decays. A 157-W Voyager-based RTG that launched in 1977 will produce about 88 W today.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Two cylindrical metal machines stacked on top of each other in a cinder block room\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"607f2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p>Another good use for nuclear batteries is to supply power in remote locations on Earth. Beginning in the 1970s, for example, the Soviet Union deployed over 1,000 RTGs in northwestern Russia to power its uncrewed lighthouses, radio beacons, and weather stations. Most of these batteries ran on strontium-90, and each weighed about 2,000 kg. The United States has deployed hundreds of similar systems for remote power both on land and on the ocean floor, particularly for <a href=\"http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/ota-bp-eti-129.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remote monitoring sites in the Arctic</a>.</p><p>While nuclear batteries have proved successful for space exploration, remote power, and pacemakers, no new uses for these long-lived batteries have emerged. Many devices would benefit from long-lived batteries\u2014imagine a wireless tire pressure sensor that lasts the life of a car, for example. But the risks and costs of opting for a radioactive battery would have to be balanced against the benefits.</p><p>Another factor working against the widespread use of nuclear batteries is the need to track the fuel. In just about any country, the sellers and buyers of any such batteries intended for the general public would need to be licensed (see box, \u201cBoy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale\u201d). The buyer also typically takes on the burden of tracking and disposing of the material. Keeping tabs on radioactive material is a necessity, but this adds complexity to applications involving the general public.</p><h3>Boy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale</h3><br /><p>In just about any country, buyers of radioisotope fuel sources must be licensed\u2014with some exceptions. In the United States, for example, you don\u2019t need a license for some radioisotopes if the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part030/part030-0071.html\" target=\"_blank\">quantity is below a certain level</a> set by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Many smoke detectors contain about 1 microcurie, or 37,000 becquerels, of americium-241, which is below the exception limit of 5 \u00b5Ci (185,000 Bq). (The radioisotope ionizes the air within the detector, and the alarm is triggered when the presence of smoke alters the ionization rate.)</p><p>The exemption quantities are too small for even the smallest nuclear battery\u2014unless someone starts up a collection. That\u2019s just what <a href=\"https://inis.iaea.org/records/vpjmt-6nz83\" target=\"_blank\">a young man in Michigan</a> in the 1990s did. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he attempted to build a neutron generator by collecting americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping-lantern mantles, radium from old clocks, and tritium from gunsights. He amassed so much radioactive material that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared his home a Superfund hazardous waste clean-up site.</p><p>But the benefits of radioisotopes are profound, and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to use them with proper care. They\u2019re used worldwide on a daily basis primarily for medical imaging and cancer therapy. They\u2019re also used as tracers to monitor fluid flow and detect leaks, for nondestructive inspection of welds, and for explosive detection.\u2014J.B.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>One new use where the benefits may outweigh the risks and costs is providing longer-lived power to soldiers\u2014something the U.S. military has explored. Soldiers\u2019 missions often take them to remote or unstable locations where electricity may be unavailable, preventing them from charging their equipment. This forces soldiers to carry batteries, the weight and life of which limit their missions. Small nuclear batteries would provide a lightweight alternative\u2014potentially 1/100 the weight\u2014due to their higher energy density relative to that of chemical batteries. But they would need to be encased to shield soldiers from the radiation, and designed to withstand harsh conditions, which would add weight.</p><p>Another potential new use for nuclear batteries is to power autonomous sensors or robots that communicate, move, or fly. One compelling use would be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-robot-2671447539\" target=\"_self\">insect-size flying microdrones</a> for civilian and military purposes. But collecting them at the end of their flights might be difficult and would also leave tiny bits of radioactive material littering the landscape.</p><h2>Engineering Challenges: Betavoltaics Versus Alphavoltaics</h2><p>Let\u2019s turn to the engineering challenges of commercializing a miniature nuclear battery. In general, taking a promising battery technology from the lab to mass production is a complex process that\u2019s more likely to end in failure than success. With nuclear batteries, it involves negotiating a lot of trade-offs between cost, power, safety, and life-span.</p><p>First, you have to pick the fuel\u2014that is, an isotope of an element that will release radiation as it decays. Such isotopes emit three types of radiation: gamma rays, beta particles, and alpha particles. Gamma rays are short-wavelength electromagnetic waves that can travel deep into most solids, including living tissue. They\u2019re difficult to contain and capture, so gamma-emitting isotopes are typically avoided.</p><h3>Table 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u00a0</h3><br /><table border=\"0\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Isotope</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Type</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Maximum decay energy<br />(kiloelectron volt)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\"> Half-life (year)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Specific power (watts per gram)</th></tr><tr><td> Tritium</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">19</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">12.3</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.33</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Carbon-14</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">156</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,730</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.0013</td></tr><tr><td>Nickel-63</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">67</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">100</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.0058</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Promethium-147</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">225</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">2.6</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.41</td></tr><tr><td>Polonium-210</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">5,305</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.38</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">141</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Plutonium-238</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,593</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">87.7</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.56</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"photo-credit\">Credit/source: Jake Blanchard</p><p class=\"caption\">Radioisotopes emit particles with a spectrum of energies. The decay energy is a measure of the kinetic energy of emitted particles as the radioisotope decays. The specific power provided here is a measure of how much power an ideal, pure radioisotope source can generate per unit of mass at the beginning of its life.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Pure beta or alpha emitters are a better choice for nuclear batteries. Beta particles are electrons that have an intermediate penetration range in solids. Their decay energies go from a few kiloelectron volts (for tritium, or hydrogen-3) to a few megaelectron volts (for yttrium-90). Alpha particles, by contrast, are emitted at a higher energy than beta particles\u2014typically around 5 MeV\u2014and can\u2019t penetrate a piece of paper. But they can damage semiconductors by creating defects as they collide with the nuclei in the device. This makes alpha emitters best suited for non-semiconductor battery technologies that convert the heat generated by the source fuel into electricity.</p><p>Radioisotopes of nickel, carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, promethium, polonium, and plutonium all emit beta or alpha particles and are good options for nuclear batteries (see \u201cTable 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u201d). Which one to choose depends on several factors, including the isotope\u2019s half-life and its decay energy.</p><p>For the longest battery life, you\u2019ll want a radioisotope with a long half-life, because the battery\u2019s output power will drop by a factor of two over each half-life. That means a tritium-fueled device will lose half its power every 12 years, while a plutonium-238 battery will lose half its power every 88 years.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>What very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If your goal is instead to maximize the battery\u2019s power density\u2014such as for an insect-size microdrone\u2014then you\u2019ll need one with a short half-life<strong>.</strong> For example, polonium-210 has a half-life of a few months, but a power density of 141 watts per gram, which could give it enough power to carry its payload. The short half-life would mean it would work only for a few months and would completely decay within a couple of years. But for a microdrone that will probably be abandoned somewhere, perhaps that\u2019s a good thing. (Note that these power densities account for thermal power, but there are losses in converting to electricity, so the output power density of any devices created using this fuel will be lower.)</p><p>The safest nuclear battery fuels are tritium and nickel-63, because they produce low-energy beta particles that are easier to shield and less damaging to semiconductors than alpha particles. Pure tritium can be challenging to work with because it\u2019s a gas at room temperature. It can be converted into a metal hydride, but this process, which involves mixing it with stable isotopes, decreases its energy density. Another design consideration is that the lower penetration depth of these safer, low-energy <a href=\"https://blanchard.engr.wisc.edu/purebeta.htm\" target=\"_blank\">beta emitters</a> requires that the sources be made very thin, or else the particles will never reach the battery\u2019s semiconductor.</p><p>What about supply and cost? All radioisotopes are expensive to procure and are typically only available in small quantities. Just about any of them can be made during nuclear fission by placing a dedicated target material in the reactor core. They can also be made using particle accelerators. Some types of radioisotopes can be obtained from spent nuclear fuel. But none of these options is simple or inexpensive, because every step requires the handling of radioactive materials.</p><p>One gram of tritium costs about US $30,000 and will produce a thermal power of about 0.3 W, which would in turn typically produce an electric power of only a few milliwatts. The supply of plutonium-238 is so limited that NASA must set its launch schedule according to the availability of the fuel. As a result, NASA is pursuing americium-241 as an alternative. It\u2019s unclear how these costs would change if the market for these materials grows substantially.</p><h2>How to Convert Radioisotope Power Sources</h2><p>After choosing a fuel, you have to select a conversion technology. Early radioisotope power sources developed in the 1950s simply collected the charged decay particles, producing an electric potential difference between the collector and the source\u2014that is, a voltage\u2014that could then be tapped to produce electricity. The current in these designs was inherently low, and so the battery had to be run at a high voltage (in the kilovolts) to achieve a reasonable conversion efficiency, which proved too challenging.</p><p>To get around this problem, you can use a semiconductor to turn each charged particle emitted by the source into thousands of charge carriers, allowing the device to run at a few volts instead of a few kilovolts. The physics of such a device is essentially that of a solar cell, except that the source of the radiation is from a radioisotope instead of the sun. When the radioisotope is a beta-particle emitter, we call the device \u201cbetavoltaic.\u201d</p><h3>Three Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u00a0</h3><br /><p><span>As radioactive isotopes decay, their nuclei spontaneously release energy in the form of radiation</span>. The energy can be captured, converted into electricity, and stored, creating a nuclear battery. In common designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation and convert it to an electric current, or thermoelectric devices convert the heat that radioisotopes produce to electricity. But more-exotic techniques such as radioluminescent, thermionic, and thermophotovoltaic conversion are also being explored.  </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of light and energy transfer from radioactive to photovoltaic systems.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09f7f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-light-and-energy-transfer-from-radioactive-to-photovoltaic-systems.png?id=61488113&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Radioluminescent conversion</strong></p><p>In this approach, a scintillator, such as a cerium-doped lutetium aluminum crystal, is exposed to ionizing radiation from the isotope, causing it to emit light. The light is captured and converted to electricity with a photovoltaic cell, which can be tuned to the frequency of the emitted light to improve conversion efficiency. But the light production itself is inefficient.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of a heat engine showing heat flow and electron movement in a plasma-filled gap.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7136b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-a-heat-engine-showing-heat-flow-and-electron-movement-in-a-plasma-filled-gap.png?id=61488106&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermionic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This concept uses the radioisotope to produce a hot surface (typically above 1,500</span> \u00b0C), which then releases electrons via thermionic emission. The source is heated as the emitted particles deposit their kinetic energy in the solid through interactions with the source atoms. The electrons emitted by the surface can be collected to produce a potential and a current source. Conversion efficiency can reach 20 percent, but achieving the necessary temperatures requires large sources, so this technology is only appropriate for high-power applications. </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Heat-to-electricity conversion diagram using thermophotovoltaic (TPV) technology.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"49131\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/heat-to-electricity-conversion-diagram-using-thermophotovoltaic-tpv-technology.png?id=61488098&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermophotovoltaic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This strategy uses </span>a radioisotope to produce a hot surface, and electromagnetic radiation from the hot surface produces electricity within a photovoltaic cell. To obtain good efficiencies, these devices must run very hot\u2014around 2,000\u00b0C for a conversion efficiency of 29 percent.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Under development since the 1950s, betavoltaic batteries feature a radioactive emitter and a silicon-diode absorber. As the emitter naturally decays, electrons (in the form of beta particles) strike the absorber. This creates a cascade of electron-hole pairs, which occur when electrons are removed from their original position, leaving a \u201chole\u201d that generates a small but stable supply of electric current. This process is similar to that of a solar cell, where light produces the electron-hole pairs.</p><p>Betavoltaic batteries with silicon diodes have conversion efficiencies of a few percent, and up to 10 percent with silicon carbide, and can typically operate at around 1 volt. Some models indicate that this <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9936597\" target=\"_blank\">efficiency can be as high as 23.5 percent</a>. Recent research on betavoltaics uses diamond semiconductors, which offer even higher conversion efficiencies due to their higher bandgap.</p><p>Betavoltaics are solid-state, simple, and relatively inexpensive, so they offer an ideal way to produce a low-power option (less than about a milliwatt) for nuclear batteries. They can be used to create higher-power devices, but in those cases it\u2019s often better to switch to an alpha emitter to achieve a higher power density. However, because the alpha particles will damage a semiconductor, their use generally requires a conversion option that relies on heat converted to electricity.</p><p>For example, NASA uses thermoelectric conversion in its RTGs, which have been used to power not only <em>Voyager 1</em> and <em>2</em>, but also two Mars rovers and over <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rps-fleet.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">40 other NASA missions</a>. If you\u2019ve seen the movie <em>The Martian</em>, you may recall how Matt Damon\u2019s character, trapped alone on Mars, used an RTG: He needed a heat source to stay warm while traveling in a rover, so he dug up an old RTG from a previous mission and placed it inside his vehicle.</p><p>To convert the heat to electricity, the RTGs employ a series of thermocouples, which consist of a junction of two dissimilar conductors. These components produce a potential in the presence of a temperature gradient (via what\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/how-does-a-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-rtg-work-the-seebeck-effect/#:~:text=The%20scientist%2C%20Thomas%20Seebeck%2C%20found,of%20compounds%20known%20as%20semiconductors.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seebeck</a> effect). The pacemakers of the 1970s also relied on thermoelectric conversion, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p>Other, more-exotic conversion techniques include radioluminescent conversion, thermionic conversion, and thermophotovoltaic conversion (see sidebar, \u201cThree Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u201d), all of which work well in the lab but require higher operating temperatures or have degradation issues. Most companies are focused on developing betavoltaic technology because it permits the use of the safer beta emitters.</p><h2>Who Is Developing Nuclear Batteries?</h2><p>Since the invention of small betavoltaic power sources in the 1970s, the vast majority of research on nuclear batteries has focused on power levels of less than 1 microwatt (see \u201cTable 2: Who\u2019s Developing Nuclear Batteries\u201d). To date, many of these efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.betavolt.tech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</a> says it has a 100-\u00b5W battery that\u2019s about the size of a cereal square (15 by 15 by 5 millimeters) and can last 50 years. The company is working with betavoltaics using nickel-63, tritium, promethium-147, and strontium-90, and a diamond semiconductor to convert the energy to electricity.</p><h3>Table 2: Who\u2019s Developing Nuclear Batteries\u00a0\u00a0</h3><br /><table border=\"1\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">        Company/research group (location)</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Radioisotope</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">        Conversion technology</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Goals and accomplishments</th></tr><tr><td>Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</td><td>Nickel-63</td><td>Betavoltaic with diamond diode semiconductor</td><td>100-microwatt battery; planning a 1-watt version for commercial launch</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\"><a href=\"https://www.arkenlight.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> Arkenlight</a> (Bristol, England)</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Carbon-14 and tritium</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Betavoltaic with diamond diode semiconductor</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Exploring use in satellites, medical implants, industrial sensors, and luxury watches</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.dgist.ac.kr/eng/index.do\" target=\"_blank\"> Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology</a> (Daegu, South Korea)</td><td>Carbon-14</td><td>Betavoltaic with titanium dioxide semiconductor sensitized with ruthenium dye</td><td>Presented results at American Chemical Society spring meeting, March 2025</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\"><a href=\"https://citylabs.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> City Labs</a> (Miami)</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Tritium</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Betavoltaic</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Focused on space, deep ocean, and medical applications; 20-year battery life</td></tr><tr><td>Northwest Normal University (Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China) and <a href=\"http://www.beitalab.com/company.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wuxi Beita Pharmatech</a> Co.

Potential applications include aerospace, medical implants, wearable devices, MEMS systems, advanced sensors, small drones, miniature robots, law-enforcement equipment, and fire-safety remote communication.</p><p>Assuming Beijing Betavolt\u2019s device has a conversion efficiency of about 5 percent, the battery would have to hold about 20 curies, or 740 billion becquerels (0.4 grams), of nickel-63. This is well above the typical amount of nickel-63 available on the market, which is normally in the millicurie range.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">To date, many efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p>Infinity Power also uses nickel-63 in its coin-size battery, but may need less of it because of the novel electrochemical conversion process it has developed. The company says its conversion efficiency exceeds 60 percent\u2014about six times as efficient as the best radioisotope power generators.</p><p>In Infinity\u2019s design, the isotope is dissolved or suspended in a proprietary liquid electrolyte. The decay of the radioisotope produces high-energy beta particles that ionize the electrolyte, creating a potential difference between the anode and cathode immersed in the solution and driving electron flow through an external circuit to produce electricity.</p><p>Academic and government researchers are also pursuing nuclear batteries. The University of Bristol, in England, and the UKAEA last year announced they had developed a battery fueled by carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. With carbon-14\u2019s half-life of 5,700 years, the battery could theoretically last for millennia. The U.K. has an ample supply of the fuel because it can be scavenged from the country\u2019s graphite-moderated, gas-cooled fission reactors. Carbon-14 produces beta particles with a maximum energy of 156 kiloelectron volt, which should be low enough to prevent damage to the battery\u2019s diamond semiconductor.</p><p>Meanwhile, a collaboration of researchers in China published a report in the December 2024 <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science</em></em> on a <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709846/authors#authors\" target=\"_blank\">radioluminescent nuclear battery</a>. The team used an X-ray source, which emits electromagnetic radiation, to mimic a beta source, which emits electrons, to help them understand how the device might perform. The X-ray photons excited two inorganic scintillators, causing them to emit light, and a commercial silicon photodiode converted the light to electricity.</p><p>The products envisioned by these startups offer great promise. The key to their lasting success will be identifying markets in which the benefits of nuclear batteries outweigh the challenges. The market for these devices in space applications is strong, but whether new markets will arise remains to be seen. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Yu-Tzu Chiu, who contributed reporting for this article.</em></p>"

By leveraging algebraic properties and periodicities, the FFT reduced the number of the operations, making it particularly and practically feasible for everyday tasks, replacing the less efficient analog methods.\u201d</p><h2>A new mathematical tool</h2><p>In 1963 Tukey, a professor of mathematics and statistics at Princeton, participated in a meeting of U.S. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Science_Advisory_Committee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Advisory Committee</a> to discuss ways to detect underground nuclear tests, according to the ETHW entry.</p><p>Also attending that meeting was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/richard-garwin\" target=\"_self\">Richard Garwin</a>, a physicist and engineer at <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/richard-garwin-obituary\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a> who played a key role in designing the first hydrogen bomb. He died in May. Read about his fascinating life in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/richard-garwin-hydrogen-bomb-obituary\" target=\"_self\">In Memoriam</a>. </p><p>Tukey told Garwin he was working on speeding up the computation of an existing method\u2014the Fourier transform\u2014thinking it might help with the detection. His algorithm<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> mathematically converted a signal from its original domain, such as time or space, to a frequency domain</a>.</p><p>Garwin recognized its potential and asked IBM to select a mathematical analyst to collaborate with Tukey. That person was Cooley, a research staff member working on numerical analysis and computation projects.</p><p>If the Fourier transform could be made faster, Garwin said, <a href=\"https://ethw.org/James_W._Cooley#:~:text=He%20suggested%20the%20idea%20of,and%20an%20IEEE%20Centennial%20medal.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">seismometers could be planted in the ground</a> in countries surrounding the Soviet Union to detect nuclear explosions from atomic bomb tests, because the Soviets wouldn\u2019t allow on-site tests, according to Cooley\u2019s <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Oral-History:James_W._Cooley#Tukey,_Garwin_and_FFT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">oral history</a> in the Engineering and Technology History Wiki. A seismometer measures ground vibrations, which are converted into electrical signals and recorded as seismograms.</p><p>To design sensors for underground nuclear tests, however, \u201cyou would have to process all the seismic signals, and a large part of the processing could be done by Fourier transforms,\u201d Cooley said in his oral history. But \u201cthe computing power at the time was not enough to process all of the signals you\u2019d need to do this.\u201d</p><p>The FFT could calculate a seismic sensor\u2019s frequency and produce images, IEEE Life Fellow <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/harold-stone\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Harold S.

Through his involvement with the IEEE Digital Signal Processing Committee (today known as the <a href=\"https://signalprocessingsociety.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Signal Processing Society</a>), he helped establish terminology and suggested research directions.</p><p>Although not one of the inventors, Garwin is credited with recognizing that the algorithm had wider applications, especially in scientific and engineering fields.</p><p>\u201cIn today\u2019s lingo, Garwin helped the FFT \u2018go viral\u2019 by getting Cooley and Tukey together,\u201d Stone said.</p><p>\u201cGarwin and Tukey sought better information to forestall and prevent wars,\u201d added Frank Anscombe, Tukey\u2019s nephew. \u201cThe Cooley-Tukey FFT swiftly advanced this cause by giving a practical, simplifying solution for wavy data. Thanks to the FFT, a technological rubicon began to be crossed: analog-to-digital machines.\u201d</p><h2>A spirit of collaboration between academia and industry</h2><p>Like so many innovations, the FFT came out of a collaboration between industry and academia, and it should be recognized for that, IEEE Fellow <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/princeton-dean-andrea-goldsmith\" target=\"_self\">Andrea Goldsmith</a> said at the ceremony. She explained that she regularly works with FFT in her research projects. At the time of the event, she was Princeton\u2019s dean of engineering and applied sciences. This month she started her new position as president of <a href=\"https://news.stonybrook.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stony Brook University</a>, in New York.</p><p>\u201cTaking the ideas we have from basic research in our university labs, talking to people in industry, and understanding how the research problems we work on can benefit industry either tomorrow or in five years or 20 years from now, is incredibly important,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people think of engineering as boring and dry and something that only nerds do, but there is such beauty and creativity in a lot of the innovations that we have developed, and I think the FFT is a perfect example of that.\u201d</p><p>The FFT joins more than 270 other IEEE Milestones.

The brain interprets fear as a sign of danger, she added, and that triggers a fight-or-flight physiological reaction.</p><p>When faced with social threats such as failure, rejection, and humiliation, she said, the fight-or-flight response can cause a person to lose the ability to reason, solve problems, and think clearly.</p><p>If that happens, she said, analyze what you fear and what might happen if things go sour. Create an action plan if it happens. When you have a plan, she said, you feel more in control.</p><p>When people are anxious, however, it\u2019s often difficult for them to strategize. Meninger\u2019s suggestions on how to stay calm include: </p><p><strong>Take deep breaths.</strong> It sends a signal to your brain that there is no physical threat. If you are going into a meeting that you know will trigger your anxiety, start breathing exercises a few minutes before it starts.</p><p><strong>Bring water with you. </strong>Taking a sip of your beverage during your presentation is a great pause button, buying you time to think about what you want to say next, Meninger said, and drinking something won\u2019t attract attention. You gain a moment to collect yourself.</p><p><strong>Speak slowly.</strong> Anxious people often start speaking quickly, she said. Words and thoughts can diverge, and you can lose the ability to communicate clearly. If you intentionally speak slower, it requires you to focus, diverting your attention from any panic you\u2019re feeling. It also makes you appear more in command of your message.</p><h2>Adopt a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d</h2><p>The growth mindset, Meninger said, is the belief that a person\u2019s abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication to learning and hard work, rather than being fixed traits.</p><p>Many people develop a fixed mindset in adulthood, believing that their abilities and intelligence are unchangeable. If you have a growth mindset, you believe you can control your destiny and choose whether you want to invest in becoming better at something.</p><p>People with a fixed mindset who are not good at math, for example, might attribute it to a lack of understanding the subject. Those with a growth mindset might study or find a tutor to help them, knowing that they can improve with focus and time.</p><p>Having a growth mindset can help you become more confident and less likely to experience imposter syndrome, Meninger said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to be aware when you start blaming genetics or natural abilities for what you view as shortcomings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always notice the way we adopt fixed mindsets.\u201d</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cYour strengths are the raw materials that allow you to make an impact on your team, organization, family, and community.\u201d</span></p><p>That is where what Meninger calls the <em><em>power of yet</em></em> comes into play. When you tell yourself that you\u2019re not good at something, add a <em><em>yet</em></em> at the end of the sentence. For example, say \u201cI\u2019m not good at presenting yet,\u201d rather than simply \u201cI\u2019m not good at presenting.\u201d</p><p>Adding that single word opens up the possibility of improving rather than making the lack of a skill a definitive statement that can\u2019t be changed, she said.</p><p>Another suggested way to practice a growth mindset is to \u201cbecome a beginner intentionally,\u201d Meninger said. \u201cPerfectionists only take risks where they\u2019re virtually guaranteed to succeed. Because of this, they tend not to experience the discomfort of learning and growing.\u201d</p><p>One way to break out of that cycle, she said, is to learn a new skill outside of work, such as knitting, art, playing a musical instrument, or speaking another language.</p><h2>Celebrate your successes</h2><p>Many people don\u2019t take time to celebrate their successes. Instead, they focus on their mistakes and failures, whether real or perceived. One reason, Meninger said, is that culture and family expectations influence the way people view mistakes and successes. Several cultures teach humility and that one should not talk about their successes, as it can be boastful.</p><p>\u201cWe owe it to ourselves to unapologetically accept that we have strengths,\u201d Meninger said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing shameful about that. Your strengths are the raw materials that allow you to make an impact on your team, organization, family, and community.\u201d</p><p>If you don\u2019t know what you do well, you can\u2019t channel it in a positive direction, she said. Knowing your strengths isn\u2019t about stroking your ego but rather understanding how you can be of service to others.</p><p>Your brain won\u2019t focus on your successes naturally, so it\u2019s important to practice, Meninger said. One way to do so is to keep an accomplishment journal. Write down three things each day that went well, or problems you solved, at work or in your personal life.</p><p>Your journal also can be used as a source when you need to fill out a performance evaluation for your employer or to make a case for a promotion, she said. It helps to build your confidence because you can see your successes listed.</p><h2>Leverage your resources</h2><p>You don\u2019t need to be an expert on every subject, Meninger said; you just need to recognize what you don\u2019t know. To gain expertise, create relationships with people who have knowledge you\u2019re missing, she recommended: Instead of putting pressure on yourself to be all-knowing, think about who at your company can complement your skills and how you can work with them.</p><p>Also, if you\u2019re worried that everyone else in a meeting has more experience than you and you\u2019re doubting your contributions, inquire why you were invited. Ask the meeting organizer what they would like you to contribute or what information they want you to prepare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go into a mystery meeting that will cause you more anxiety,\u201d Meninger cautioned.</p><p>When you ask such questions, you likely will learn the organizer invited you because of a strength you have.</p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-updates-2025\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Women in Engineering</a> regularly hosts <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/tips-on-how-to-elevate-your-career/\" target=\"_blank\">career-related</a> webinars, which are available to <a href=\"https://wie.ieee.org/events/category/webinars/career/\" target=\"_blank\">watch on demand on its website</a>.

It\u2019s also hard and sometimes dangerous work. But technology is being spun up to make the job safer and easier.</p><p>A new class of devices is being targeted at fleets that helps drivers elude accidents by flagging risky situations. The new systems use <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=convolutional+neural+networks\" target=\"_self\">convolutional neural networks</a> running in the vehicle <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/edge-ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">(\u201cedge\u201d AI</a>) and in the cloud to fuse data inputs from on-board vehicle diagnostics, along with data from cameras facing the driver and the roadway. The result are systems that can assess, in real time, the risk of collision and warn drivers in time to avoid most of them.</p><p>One of the most advanced of the new systems is from a company called Nauto. Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.vtti.vt.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Tech Transportation Institute</a> (VTTI) put the AI-enabled safety system from the Palo Alto, Calif.\u2013based startup through its paces on the same <a href=\"https://www.vtti.vt.edu/facilities/virginia-smart-roads.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Smart Roads</a> controlled-access test tracks where it conducted a 2023 benchmark study evaluating three similar products. VTTI says this year\u2019s testing was performed under the same scenarios of distracted driving, rolling stops, tailgating, and night driving.</p><p>According to the Virginia Tech researchers, Nauto\u2019s dashcam matched or outperformed the previously benchmarked gadgets in detection accuracy\u2014and provided feedback that translated more directly into information supervisors could use to address and correct risky driver behavior. \u201cThis study allowed us to evaluate driver monitoring technologies in a controlled, repeatable way, so we could clearly measure how the [Nauto] system responded to risky behaviors,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.vtti.vt.edu/staffdir/bio.php?&amp;pn=10234\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Soccolich</a>, a senior research associate at VTTI.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a> driver attention researcher <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bryan-reimer_roadsafety-visionzero-safedriving-activity-7361123340129873921-sMgh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAEdwGcBTFAcT9mXQR1KyLVZg4cF4uhccn0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bryan Reimer</a>, who was not involved in the study, says the real value of systems like Nauto\u2019s lies beyond monitoring. \u201cMany companies focus only on monitoring, but monitoring alone is just an enabler\u2014the sensor, like radar in adaptive cruise control or forward collision warning. The real art lies in the support systems that shape driver behavior. That\u2019s what makes Nauto unique.\u201d</p><h2>Reducing Alert Fatigue in Trucking Safety</h2><p> \u201cOne of our primary goals is to issue alerts only when corrective action is still possible,\u201d says Nauto CEO <a href=\"https://www.nauto.com/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stefan Heck</a>. Just as important, he adds, is a design meant to avoid \u201calert fatigue,\u201d a well-known phenomenon where alerts triggered when situations don\u2019t actually call for it makes would-be responders less apt to take heed. False alerts have long plagued driver-assist systems, causing drivers to eventually disregard even the most serious warnings.</p><p>Nauto claims its alerts are accurate more than 90 percent of the time, because it combines more than ten distraction and drowsiness indicators. Among the inattention indicators the system tracks are head nodding or tilting, yawning, change in eye blink rate, long eyelid closures (indicating something called microsleeps), and gaze drifting from the road for extended periods (what happens when people text and drive). If a pedestrian enters the crosswalk and the driver is awake, alert, and not driving too fast, the system will remain silent under the assumption that the driver will slow down or stop so the person on foot can cross the street without incident. But if it notices that the driver is scrolling on their phone, it will sound an alarm\u2014and perhaps trigger a visual warning too\u2014in time to avoid causing injury.</p><p>While VTTI did not specifically test false-positive rates, it did measure detection accuracy across multiple scenarios. Soccolich reports that in Class 8 tractor tests, the system issued audible in-cab alerts for 100 percent of handheld calls, outgoing texts, discreet lap use of a smartphone, and seat belt violations, as well as 95 percent of rolling stops. For tailgating a lead vehicle, it alerted in 50 percent of trials initially, but after adjustment, delivered alerts in 100 percent of cases.</p><p>Nauto\u2019s alarms can be triggered not only in the driver\u2019s cabin but also in fleet supervisors\u2019 offices of the trucking company that uses the system. But Nauto structures its alerts to prioritize the driver: Warnings\u2014for all but the most high-risk situations\u2014go to the cab of the truck, allowing self-correction, while supervisors are notified only when the system detects recklessness or a pattern of lower-risk behavior that requires corrective action.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cMany companies focus only on monitoring, but monitoring alone is just an enabler\u2014the sensor, like radar in adaptive cruise control or forward collision warning. The real art lies in the support systems that shape driver behavior. That\u2019s what makes Nauto unique.\u201d <strong>\u2013Bryan Reimer,  MIT</strong></p><h2>Advanced Dashcam for Fleet Risk Management</h2><p>The company packages its vehicle hardware in a windshield-mounted dashcam that plugs into a truck\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bumper.co/blog/what-is-an-obd-port\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on-board diagnostics port</a>. With forward- and driver-facing cameras and direct access to vehicle data streams, the device continuously recalculates risk. A delivery driver glancing at a phone while drifting from their lane, for example, triggers an immediate warning and a notice to supervisors that the driver\u2019s behavior warrants being called on the carpet for their recklessness.</p><p>By contrast, a rural stop sign roll-through at dawn might trigger nothing more than a cheerful reminder to come to a complete stop next time. There are more complex cases, as when a driver is following another vehicle too closely. On a sunny day, in light traffic, the system might let it go, holding back from issuing a warning about the tailgating. But if it starts to rain, the system recognizes the change in safe stopping distance and updates its risk calculation. The driver is told to back off so there\u2019s enough space to stop the truck in time on the rain-slick road if the lead car suddenly slams on its brakes.</p><p>Nauto aims to give drivers three to four seconds to steer clear, brake gently, or refocus. \u201cThe better response isn\u2019t always slamming on the brakes,\u201d Heck says. \u201cSometimes swerving is safer, and no automated braking system today will do that.\u201d</p><h2>AI Dashcams Lower Trucking Collision Rates</h2><p>According to a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21368660847&amp;gbraid=0AAAAApY_Ogrk-oXNTSEuTa7lwsYpL1eOP&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwqqDFBhDhARIsAIHTlksYDwbcB9uJZwRFavrdaHllEw0dnSg_v_gsJmy9RIk4bTZq5RGsDUIaAj_2EALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Insurance Institute for Highway safety</a> (IIHS) report, if all vehicles in the United States were <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/research-areas/bibliography/ref/2111\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">equipped with both forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking</a> in 2014, \u201calmost 1 million police-reported rear-end crashes and more than 400,000 injuries in such crashes could have been prevented.\u201d A separate IIHS study concluded that putting both technologies on a vehicle was good enough to prevent half of all such collisions. Heck, pointing to those numbers as well as to the Nauto system\u2019s ability to sense danger originating both outside and inside a truck, claims his company\u2019s AI-enabled dashcam can help cut the incidence of collisions even further than those built-in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/adas\" target=\"_self\">advanced driver assistance systems</a> do.</p><p>Vehicle damage obviously costs a lot of money and time to fix. Fleets also pay follow-on costs such as those associated with <a href=\"https://www.trucking.org/news-insights/truth-about-trucking-turnover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">driver turnover</a>, a persistent problem in trucking. Lower crash rates, conversely, cut recruitment and training costs and reduce insurance premiums\u2014giving fleet managers strong incentive to implement technologies like this new class of AI dashcams. </p><p><span>Today, Nauto\u2019s dashcam is an aftermarket add-on about the size of a smartphone, but the company envisions future vehicles with the technology embedded as a software feature. With insurers increasingly setting their rates based on telematics from fleets, the ability to combine video evidence, vehicle data, and driver monitoring could reshape how risk is calculated and rates are set.</span></p><p>Ultimately the effectiveness of these risk assessment\u2013and-alerting devices hinges on driver trust. If the driver believes that the system is designed to make them a better, safer motorist rather than to serve as a surveillance tool so the company can look over their shoulder, they\u2019ll be more likely to accept input from their electronic copilot\u2014and less likely to crash.</p>"

During development, conditions on the Moon such as dust exposure, radiation, and the vacuum of space are taken into account, along with the 14-Earth-day duration of a lunar night.</em></blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span></p><p>[ <a href=\"https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/samler-ki\">DFKI</a> ]</p><div class=\"horizontal-rule\"></div><blockquote class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"8qw5l_yovz8\"><em>ARMstrong Dex is a human-scale dual-arm hydraulic robot developed by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) for disaster response applications.

We had developed a new class of quantum dots\u2014nanoscale particles of light-emitting semiconductor material that can be used in displays, solar cells, and more. Our technology was safer, more stable, and less expensive than <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-dots-nobel-prize\" target=\"_self\">existing quantum-dot materials</a>. The technical advantages were real, but I quickly learned that no amount of scientific merit guarantees market success.</p><p>For many tech-startup founders, this is an uncomfortable but necessary realization. You can build an elegant solution, but if it doesn\u2019t solve a meaningful problem in the market, it won\u2019t go anywhere commercially. The earlier you embrace that lesson, the better your odds of success.</p><h2>Your Invention Isn\u2019t the Business</h2><p>My background is in research. I have a Ph.D. in materials science from the <a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois\u2013Urbana-Champaign</a>, and I did a postdoc at <a href=\"https://www.lanl.gov/engage/organizations/cels/chemistry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Los Alamos</a>, in New Mexico, working on nanomaterials in the chemistry division. My focus was always on advancing scientific knowledge, publishing papers, and in some cases filing patents. Like many researchers, I eventually grew tired of chasing citations and wanted to apply that work to the real world.</p><p>That\u2019s why I started <a href=\"https://www.ubiqd.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UbiQD</a>. We had a material that solved the technical shortcomings of conventional quantum dots, which require toxic heavy metals like cadmium or lead and involve expensive manufacturing processes. However, when we first introduced it to the market, the conversations we had were eye-opening. People didn\u2019t care about the material for its own sake. They cared about whether it solved their problem, and the severity of the problem defined their urgency.</p><p>My advice: If you can\u2019t clearly explain how your technology makes someone\u2019s life easier, safer, more sustainable, or more profitable, you\u2019re not ready to sell it. </p><h2>\u201cThrowing It Over the Fence\u201d Doesn\u2019t Work</h2><p>Our early thinking was overly simplistic: Create better quantum dots, scale production, and let customers apply the technology to the industries that benefit from quantum dots\u2019 ability to manipulate light. We figured, if we make it, the customers will come. </p><p>To speed things up, we offered research-grade samples for testing. A number of early adopters asked for samples, but that \u201cthrow it over the fence\u201d approach <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/when-innovation-moves-too-fast\" target=\"_self\">typically doesn\u2019t work</a> with a novel enabling technology. Whether it\u2019s advanced materials, hardware, or software, you can\u2019t expect customers to figure out what solution works best; that\u2019s your job. </p><p>So before scaling your tech, spend time with potential customers. Listen more than you talk and identify their true pain points. Ask them what keeps them up at night. That\u2019s where the real opportunities lie: in the chances to provide a must-have painkiller, rather than a nice-to-have daily vitamin.</p><h2>Shelve the Ideas That Don\u2019t Fit</h2><p>One of the hardest lessons tech founders must learn is how to recognize when a beloved idea doesn\u2019t align with market needs. </p><p>Take <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-dawn-of-solar-windows\" target=\"_self\">solar windows</a> for greenhouses, one of the ideas we thought would be a hit but then had to shelve. Greenhouses spend a lot on electricity, so it seemed logical that they\u2019d want to generate electricity directly in the facade of the greenhouse. However, growers told us their biggest concern was crop yield, not operational costs. Light-absorbing windows could potentially cause a slight reduction in yield, and any such reduction\u2014even with energy savings\u2014would likely hurt their bottom line.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>That\u2019s where the real opportunities lie: in the chances to provide a must-have painkiller, rather than a nice-to-have daily vitamin.</span></p><p>So we paused the solar-window idea in 2018 and focused instead on a simpler, higher-impact product: greenhouse <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-dots-shift-sunlights-spectrum-to-speed-plant-growth\" target=\"_self\">films that shift the color of light</a> to help plants grow faster. The growers cared about yield, and that\u2019s what we addressed using our technology. This agricultural application is now one of UbiQD\u2019s main focus areas. </p><p>Don\u2019t get emotionally attached to one application or use case. If your company is built on a platform technology, stay flexible. The market will tell you where your technology fits\u2014and where it doesn\u2019t. </p><h2>Competition Means You\u2019re on the Right Track</h2><p>Many founders dread competition. I see it differently. When we entered the agriculture space, we saw other startups and a few large companies exploring similar ideas. That wasn\u2019t discouraging. It was validating. If no one else is working on the problem, it might not be a worthwhile opportunity. </p><p>Some startups also try to stay under the radar to gain an edge. But if potential partners or early customers don\u2019t know you\u2019re working on a problem, they can\u2019t contribute to, challenge, or help accelerate your solution. That said, differentiation matters. Our edge comes from robust intellectual property, technical depth, and years of hard-earned data. We\u2019ve had lots of help and input from outside the company, and some of our best customers found us first.</p><p>Expect and embrace competition, and don\u2019t be shy about it. Just make sure you have a defendable advantage\u2014whether through technology, partnerships, data, or expertise.</p><h2>Earn the Right to Expand</h2><p>As you begin to succeed in one market, you\u2019ll be tempted to expand quickly to others. But be cautious about moving too quickly. We\u2019ve turned down plenty of tempting market opportunities over the years because we hadn\u2019t earned the right to go after them yet.</p><p>For example, applying our materials to cosmetics or paints is exciting, but until we achieved sufficient production scale and cost reduction, it didn\u2019t make sense economically. Now that we\u2019ve lowered costs and built better infrastructure, those markets are back on the table, but we understood this only <em><em>after</em></em> studying potential customers and their needs.</p><p>Build scale and generate revenue in your first market, and only then explore adjacent opportunities. </p><h2>Advice I Wish I Had Heard Earlier</h2><p>If I could give my younger self just one piece of advice, it would be this: Fall in love with the problem first, then the solution.</p><p>As a tech-company founder, I spent years perfecting our technology and publishing papers about how great the science of the solutions is. Building a company, though, also means understanding your customers and the economics of solving their problems.</p><p>Science and engineering are critical, but so are customer discovery, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/product-management-career\" target=\"_self\">product management</a>, and market research. Those skills are essential, and you\u2019ll probably need them sooner than you think.</p><p>So get out of the lab. Talk to potential customers as early as possible. Be ready to adapt as you listen. And remember, the value of your technology comes from the problem it solves.</p>"
