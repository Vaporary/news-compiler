In our benchmark estimate, the total effective tax rate\u2014all taxes paid relative to economic income\u2014of the top 0.0002% (approximately the \u201ctop 400\u201d) averaged 24% in 2018\u20132020 compared with 30% for the full population and 45% for top labor income earners. This lower total effective tax rate on the wealthiest is substantially driven by low taxable individual income relative to economic income. First, the C-corporations owned by the wealthiest distributed relatively little in dividends, limiting their individual income tax unless they sell their stocks. Second, top-owned passthrough businesses reported negative taxable income on average in spite of positive book income, further limiting their individual income tax. The top-400 effective tax rate fell from 30% in 2010\u20132017 to 24% in 2018\u20132020, explained both by a smaller share of business income being taxed and by that income being subject to lower tax rates. Estate and gift taxes contributed relatively little to their effective tax rate. Top-400 decedents paid 0.8% of their wealth in estate tax when married and 7% when single. Annual charitable contributions equalled 0.6% of wealth and 11% of economic income in 2018\u201320."

We find that outsourcing legalization persistently reallocated jobs from older incumbent guards to younger entrants. Total employment of guards and their entry from informality persistently increased, while average demographic-adjusted wages remained constant. Meanwhile, a wave of occupational layoffs displaced some incumbent guards from high-wage firms. The evidence suggests that the rise of non-core activity outsourcing reduced labor market frictions, facilitated by firm-level economies of scale in human resources and spillovers to non-adopting firms."

We assemble a new workforce development dataset spanning over 1.6 million job training participation spells from all US Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act programs from 2012\u20132023 linked with occupational measures of AI exposure. Using earnings records observed before and after training, we compare high AI exposure trainees to a matched sample of similar workers who only received job search assistance. We find that AI-exposed workers have high earnings returns from training that are only 25% lower than the returns for low AI exposure workers. However, training participants who target AI-intensive occupations face a penalty for doing so, with 29% lower returns than AI-exposed workers pursuing more general training. We estimate that between 25% to 40% of occupations are \u201cAI retrainable\u201d as measured by its workers receiving higher pay for moving to more AI-intensive occupations\u2014a large magnitude given the relatively low-income sample of displaced workers. Positive earnings returns in all groups are driven by the most recent years when labor markets were tightest, suggesting training programs may have stronger signal value when firms reach deeper into the skill market."

We generalize the consumption-equivalent variation of Lucas (1987) to a multi-agent setting, asking: how much can the consumption-possibility set shrink while keeping every agent at least as well off as in their status-quo allocation? The resulting scalar \u2014 resources left over after compensating everyone \u2014 is our measure of aggregate efficiency. Efficiency rises whenever the same status-quo welfare can be achieved with fewer resources. We show how to convert this problem into an equivalent utility-maximization problem, enabling the use of tools and results normally applicable only in representative agent settings. We characterize changes in aggregate efficiency in terms of observables, like expenditures and price elasticities, and apply our results to study, among other things, the effects of productivity shocks, the costs of misallocation, and the gains from trade, both with and without costly redistribution."

His earliest memories are of welding with his grandfather and knitting with his grandmother\u2014unusual hobbies for a typical 4-year-old, though not in Mann\u2019s family. His father, who worked for a men\u2019s clothing company, supplemented his income by buying and renovating houses, long before the concept of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/house-flip.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flipping houses</a> became widespread.</p><p>\u201cWe were always living in a house under construction,\u201d Mann recalls. \u201cI used to help my dad fix things when I was 4 or 5\u2014hammer in my hand\u2014normal stuff.\u201d His grandfather, a refrigeration engineer, taught him how to weld. By age 6, he was wiring and building homemade radios. By the time he was 8, he had started a neighborhood repair business, fixing televisions and radios.</p><p>\u201cIn a sense, preschool for me was learning engineering and science,\u201d Mann says with a laugh. \u201cI grew up putting together wood, metal, or fabric. I knew how to make things at a very young age.\u201d</p><h2>Learning to see what others miss</h2><p>When Mann was 12 years old, his father brought home a broken oscillograph (an early version of the oscilloscope, used to display variations in voltage or current as visual waveforms). It turned out to be a defining moment in his life. Too impatient to accept that the waveform dot on the machine\u2019s display moved only up and down instead of both vertically and horizontally, Mann invented a way to push its image through physical space.</p><p>He placed the oscillograph\u2014which he now keeps on a shelf in his laboratory\u2014on a board mounted on roller skate wheels. He connected the device to a police radar and rolled it back and forth. When he realized the machine\u2019s motion, combined with the dot\u2019s vertical movement, created visible waveforms of the radar\u2019s signals, as a function of space rather than time, he unknowingly made a revolutionary discovery.</p><p>Later he would describe that merging of physical and virtual worlds as \u201cextended reality\u201d\u2014a concept that underlies today\u2019s<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-alliance-advancing-augmented-reality\" target=\"_self\"> AR</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/extended-reality\" target=\"_self\">XR</a> technologies. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time Mann\u2019s curiosity turned a problem into an opportunity.</p><p>Decades later, on the main floor of his Toronto home, he co-founded <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/pages/team\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">InteraXon</a>, the Toronto-based company behind the <a href=\"https://choosemuse.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqc3ta8hB6lNjQIi_jbX_Go5LphTzvrPTwE1tsykr5bg8XsWn-I\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muse brain-sensing headband</a>, used to help people manage sleep, stress, and mental health.</p><p>Mann shares legendary 1970s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/26/business/silicon-valley-tech-xerox-parc-sri.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xerox PARC</a> researcher <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kay_3972189.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kay</a>\u2019s belief that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2017/04/04/7-steps-for-inventing-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The best way to predict the future is to invent it</a>.\u201d Mann, however, adds: \u201cSometimes you invent it by simply refusing to accept the limitations of the present.\u201d</p><h2>A member of MIT\u2019s Media Lab</h2><p> In high school, Mann won several math competitions designed to challenge students at university level. In 1982 he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.mcmaster.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McMaster University</a>, in Hamilton, Ontario, to pursue a degree in engineering physics (an interdisciplinary program that combines physics, mathematics, and engineering principles). As an undergraduate, Mann was already experimenting with early prototypes of wearable computers\u2014head-mounted displays, body-worn cameras, and portable computing systems that predated mainstream mobile tech by decades.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Rehmi Post, Thad Starner, Steve Mann and Professor Alex Pentland donning wearable computers that resemble electronic eyeglasses in the 1990s.

He continued his studies at McMaster to earn a second bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1989, then a master\u2019s degree in engineering in 1991.</p><p>He then enrolled in a doctoral program at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>, where he joined its renowned <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Media Lab</a>, a hotbed for unconventional research blending technology, design, and the human experience. He formalized and expanded his ideas around wearable computing, wearable computer vision systems, and wearable AI. He also published some of the earliest academic papers that described the concept of sousveillance.</p><p>He completed his Ph.D. in media arts and sciences in 1997.</p><p>Mann\u2019s doctoral research contributed foundational concepts and hardware that influenced future smart glasses and devices for life logging, the practice of creating a digital record of one\u2019s daily life.

He says he is equally as fascinated by how technology interacts with the natural world as he is by how to remove barriers between the physical world and virtual world.</p><p><span>His interests connect to what he calls \u201cvironmentalism,\u201d which regards technology as a boundary between our environment and our \u201cvironment\u201d (ourselves). This gives rise to his vision of \u201cmersive\u201d technologies that link humans not just to each other but also to the environment around them.</span></p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span></span>\u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school.

He credits the organization with connecting him to pioneers like <a href=\"https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/news/simon-haykin-receives-ieee-medal-for-advancing-radar-technologies/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Haykin</a>, the radar visionary he met at McMaster while he was in high school.

He has served as an organizer, session chair, and program committee member for IEEE conferences related to wearable computing and pervasive sensing.</p><p>In 1997 he helped found the<a href=\"https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2024/iswc-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> International Symposium on Wearable Computers</a>, and numerous other wearable computing symposia, conferences, and events.</p><p>He has given keynote talks and presented papers on topics including sousveillance, ubiquitous computing, and other humanistic aspects of technology at the <a href=\"https://attend.ieee.org/istas-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://percom.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications</a>.</p><p>His contributions include influential papers in IEEE journals, especially various IEEE Transactions and Computer Society magazines.</p><p>Probably his most well-known paper is \u201c<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/566147\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wearable Computing</a>.\u201d Published in <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=PER300-PRT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Computer</em></em></a> magazine in October 1997, the seminal work outlined the structure and vision for wearable computing as a formal research field.

He\u2019s still driven, he says, by the same forces that powered his backyard experiments as a child: curiosity and passion.</p><p>For students who hope to follow in his footsteps, Mann\u2019s advice is simple: \u201cGo beyond [what\u2019s covered at] school. Don\u2019t define yourself by the classes you took or the jobs you had. Define yourself by what you love so much you\u2019d do it \u201ceven if no teachers or managers were demanding it\u201d. He adds that, \u201cAI can replace a walking encyclopedia. It can\u2019t replace passion.\u201d</p><p>Mann says he has no plans to retire. If anything, he says, his most productive years are yet to come.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m a late bloomer,\u201d he says, chuckling at the irony. \u201cI was fixing radios when I was 8, but my best work?

The dream was to earn double the income, accelerate the path to financial freedom, and subtly defy corporate America.</span></p><p>As we\u2019ve come back to physical offices, overemployment has become less common, but I was shocked when an engineer recently told me he was working two full-time jobs. He was enjoying the extra pay, but he was also stressed out about keeping secrets from both his managers. Beyond the anxiety of juggling two jobs, overemployment is clearly a career-limiting move for engineers.</p><p>Beyond the obvious contractual breaches\u2014most full-time employment agreements explicitly forbid this kind of moonlighting without consent\u2014overemployment is simply a bad idea.</p><p>With overemployment, you\u2019re essentially trying to \u201cget by\u201d in two roles. Instead of building strong relationships and genuinely contributing, you must perform a delicate balancing act, hoping neither employer catches on. This is incredibly short-sighted. Your career growth isn\u2019t about accumulating company logos; it\u2019s about the skills you acquire, the impact you make, and the people who can advocate for you. You\u2019ll grow exponentially faster\u2014and frankly, have a lot more fun\u2014 if you commit fully to one role.</p><p>The temporary financial bump of overemployment comes at a steep price; your coworkers will likely stop trusting you. This concern increases as you become more senior. At the Staff or Principal Engineer level, your <span>job</span> will depend on the relationships you\u2019ve built and your ability to work with (and through) other people. Overemployment, especially when it\u2019s a covert operation, is a fundamental violation of trust. How can you provide meaningful mentorship or truly collaborate when you\u2019re hiding a massive part of your professional life? I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible.</p><p>The ultimate career hack is quite simple: commit fully to a <span>job</span> where you\u2019re surrounded by smart coworkers in a company that\u2019s growing rapidly. This is far less complicated (and more ethical) than overemployment. This advice applies equally to engineers who believe they can do multiple personal projects alongside their full-time <span>job</span>.</p><p>The compounding effect of real skill development, strong professional relationships, and single-threaded focus will provide significantly better returns than any short-term double-dipping scheme. And it\u2019ll be more fun!</p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h3><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-map\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"What the Chips Act Looks Like Now\">What the Chips Act Looks Like Now</a></h3><p>The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 aimed to reestablish advanced manufacturing for logic and memory in the United States.

Onoe was instrumental in aligning companies\u2019 and countries\u2019 infrastructures as 3G networks took shape, and went to play a key role in the creating 4G standards as well. </p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecommunication-pioneer-seizo-onoe\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecommunication-pioneer-seizo-onoe\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/eu-rules-general-purpose-ai-models-start-apply-bringing-more-transparency-safety-and-accountability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"European Commission Releases Code of Practice for Generative AI\">European Commission Releases Code of Practice for</a> <a href=\"https://connect.ieee.org/NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGcOGsp4Kc2N744jx5TCG9-8fzotj_IWj7zrB4KpnFtq6ZuF6l1-OLNmlIvhjt8pRlR7-LfL_M=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"European Commission Releases Code of Practice for Generative AI\">Generative AI</a></p><p>Have you created an LLM that was trained using more than 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 floating-point operations and is used in Europe?

This will change many things about what\u2019s often described as the \u201cCIA triad\u201d of digital security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Of those three features, data integrity will become of paramount importance.</p><h3>Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Blue rocket launching near a tower with an explosive burst overhead.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8b9a4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blue-rocket-launching-near-a-tower-with-an-explosive-burst-overhead.png?id=61453398&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A 64-bit velocity calculation was converted to</span> a 16-bit output, causing an error called overflow. The corrupted data triggered catastrophic course corrections that forced the US $370 million rocket to self-destruct.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>When we have agency in digital spaces, we naturally maintain their integrity\u2014protecting them from deterioration and shaping them with intention. But in territories controlled by distant platforms, where we\u2019re merely temporary visitors, that connection frays. A disconnect emerges between those who benefit from data and those who bear the consequences of compromised integrity. Like homeowners who care deeply about maintaining the property they own, users in the Web 3.0 paradigm will become stewards of their personal digital spaces.</p><p>This will be critical in a world where <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-agents\" target=\"_self\">AI agents</a> don\u2019t just answer our questions but act on our behalf. These agents may execute financial transactions, coordinate complex workflows, and autonomously operate critical infrastructure, making decisions that ripple through entire industries. As digital agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the question is no longer whether we will trust AI but what that trust is built upon. In the new age we\u2019re entering, the foundation isn\u2019t intelligence or efficiency\u2014it\u2019s integrity.</p><h2>What Is Data Integrity?</h2><p>In information systems, integrity is the guarantee that data will not be modified without authorization, and that all transformations are verifiable throughout the data\u2019s life cycle. While availability ensures that systems are running and confidentiality prevents unauthorized access, integrity focuses on whether information is accurate, unaltered, and consistent across systems and over time.</p><h3>NASA Mars Climate Orbiter (1999)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract satellite orbiting orange planet on a dark blue background with scattered dots.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"016f0\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-satellite-orbiting-orange-planet-on-a-dark-blue-background-with-scattered-dots.png?id=61453435&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br />Lockheed Martin\u2019s software calculated thrust in pound-seconds, while NASA\u2019s navigation software expected newton-seconds. The failure caused the $328 million spacecraft to burn up in the Mars atmosphere.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It\u2019s a new idea. The undo button, which prevents accidental data loss, is an integrity feature. So is the reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state. Checksums are an integrity feature; so are verifications of network transmission.</p><p>Without integrity, security measures can backfire. Encrypting corrupted data just locks in errors. Systems that score high marks for availability but spread misinformation just become amplifiers of risk.</p><p>All IT systems require some form of data integrity, but the need for it is especially pronounced in two areas today. First: Internet of Things devices interact directly with the physical world, so corrupted input or output can result in real-world harm. Second: AI systems are only as good as the integrity of the data they\u2019re trained on, and the integrity of their decision-making processes. If that foundation is shaky, the results will be too.</p><p>Integrity manifests in four key areas. The first, <em>input integrity,</em> concerns the quality and authenticity of data entering a system. When this fails, consequences can be severe. In 2021, <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook\u2019s global outage</a> was triggered by a single mistaken command\u2014an input error missed by automated systems. Protecting input integrity requires robust authentication of data sources, cryptographic signing of sensor data, and diversity in input channels for cross-validation.</p><p>The second issue is <em>processing integrity,</em> which ensures that systems transform inputs into outputs correctly. In 2003, the <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Documents/August_2003_Blackout_Final_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.\u2013Canada blackout</a> affected 55 million people when a control-room process failed to refresh properly, resulting in damages exceeding US $6 billion. Safeguarding processing integrity means formally verifying algorithms, cryptographically protecting models, and monitoring systems for anomalous behavior.</p><h3>Microsoft\u2019s Tay Chatbot (2016)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract robot illustration with orange eyes, yellow face, blue-black mouth and beige background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"fca2a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-robot-illustration-with-orange-eyes-yellow-face-blue-black-mouth-and-beige-background.png?id=61454030&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Processing integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Released on Twitter, Microsoft</span>\u2019s AI chatbot was vulnerable to a \u201crepeat after me\u201d command, which meant it would echo any offensive content fed to it.</p><h3></h3><br /><p><em>Storage integrity</em> covers the correctness of information as it\u2019s stored and communicated. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration was <a href=\"https://www.thestack.technology/faa-outage-cause-notam-database-file-not-cyber/\" target=\"_blank\">forced to halt</a> all U.S. departing flights because of a corrupted database file. Addressing this risk requires cryptographic approaches that make any modification computationally infeasible without detection, distributed storage systems to prevent single points of failure, and rigorous backup procedures.</p><p>Finally, <em>contextual integrity</em> addresses the appropriate flow of information according to the norms of its larger context. It\u2019s not enough for data to be accurate; it must also be used in ways that respect expectations and boundaries. For example, if a smart speaker listens in on casual family conversations and uses the data to build advertising profiles, that action would violate the expected boundaries of data collection. Preserving contextual integrity requires clear data-governance policies, principles that limit the use of data to its intended purposes, and mechanisms for enforcing information-flow constraints.</p><p>As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions with reduced human oversight, all these dimensions of integrity become critical.</p><h2>The Need for Integrity in Web 3.0</h2><p>As the digital landscape has shifted from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and now evolves toward Web 3.0, we\u2019ve seen each era bring a different emphasis in the <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad\" target=\"_blank\">CIA triad</a> of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><h3>Boeing 737 MAX (2018)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Cartoon airplane crashes into water; orange 'X' symbol above indicates failure.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8f82b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/cartoon-airplane-crashes-into-water-orange-x-symbol-above-indicates-failure.png?id=61454071&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Input integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Faulty sensor data caused a</span>n automated flight-control system to repeatedly push the airplane\u2019s nose down, leading to a fatal crash.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Returning to our home metaphor: When simply having shelter is what matters most, availability takes priority\u2014the house must exist and be functional. Once that foundation is secure, confidentiality becomes important\u2014you need locks on your doors to keep others out. Only after these basics are established do you begin to consider integrity, to ensure that what\u2019s inside the house remains trustworthy, unaltered, and consistent over time.</p><p>Web 1.0 of the 1990s prioritized making information available. Organizations digitized their content, putting it out there for anyone to access. In Web 2.0, the Web of today, platforms for e-commerce, social media, and cloud computing prioritize confidentiality, as personal data has become the Internet\u2019s currency.</p><p>Somehow, integrity was largely lost along the way. In our current Web architecture, where control is centralized and removed from individual users, the concern for integrity has diminished. The massive social media platforms have created environments where no one feels responsible for the truthfulness or quality of what circulates.</p><h3>SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack (2020)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Capitol building with skull emblem and coding patterns, symbolizing cybersecurity threats.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8e236\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/capitol-building-with-skull-emblem-and-coding-patterns-symbolizing-cybersecurity-threats.png?id=61454168&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>Russian hackers compromised </span>the process that SolarWinds used to package its software, injecting malicious code that was distributed to 18,000 customers, including nine federal agencies. The hack remained undetected for 14 months.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Web 3.0 is poised to change this dynamic by returning ownership to the data owners. This is not speculative; it\u2019s already emerging. For example, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol behind decentralized social networks like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, combines content sharing with built-in attribution. Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solid protocol</a> restructures the Web around personal data pods with granular access controls.</p><p>These technologies prioritize integrity through cryptographic verification that proves authorship, decentralized architectures that eliminate vulnerable central authorities, machine-readable semantics that make meaning explicit\u2014structured data formats that allow computers to understand participants and actions, such as \u201cAlice performed surgery on Bob\u201d\u2014and transparent governance where rules are visible to all. As AI systems become more autonomous, communicating directly with one another via standardized protocols, these integrity controls will be essential for maintaining trust.</p><h2>Why Data Integrity Matters in AI</h2><p>For AI systems, integrity is crucial in four domains. The first is decision quality. With AI increasingly contributing to decision-making in health care, justice, and finance, the integrity of both data and models\u2019 actions directly impact human welfare. Accountability is the second domain. Understanding the causes of failures requires reliable logging, audit trails, and system records.</p><h3>ChatGPT Data Leak (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Unlocked orange padlock with phone displaying keyhole; purple background.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0b856\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/unlocked-orange-padlock-with-phone-displaying-keyhole-purple-background.png?id=61454212&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong></strong><strong>Storage integrity f</strong><strong>ailure</strong> <br /><span>A bug in </span>OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT mixed different users\u2019 conversation histories. Users suddenly had other people\u2019s chats appear in their interfaces with no way to prove the conversations weren\u2019t theirs.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The third domain is the security relationships between components. Many authentication systems rely on the integrity of identity information and cryptographic keys. If these elements are compromised, malicious agents could impersonate trusted systems, potentially creating cascading failures as AI agents interact and make decisions based on corrupted credentials.</p><p>Finally, integrity matters in our public definitions of safety. Governments worldwide are introducing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\" target=\"_self\">rules for AI</a> that focus on data accuracy, transparent algorithms, and verifiable claims about system behavior. Integrity provides the basis for meeting these legal obligations.</p><p>The importance of integrity only grows as AI systems are entrusted with more critical applications and operate with less human oversight. While people can sometimes detect integrity lapses, autonomous systems may not only miss warning signs\u2014they may exponentially increase the severity of breaches. Without assurances of integrity, organizations will not trust AI systems for important tasks, and we won\u2019t realize the full potential of AI.</p><h2>How to Build AI Systems With Integrity</h2><p>Imagine an AI system as a home we\u2019re building together. The integrity of this home doesn\u2019t rest on a single security feature but on the thoughtful integration of many elements: solid foundations, well-constructed walls, clear pathways between rooms, and shared agreements about how spaces will be used.</p><h3>Midjourney Bias (2023)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Abstract digital screen with colorful user icons and communication symbols.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"59897\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/abstract-digital-screen-with-colorful-user-icons-and-communication-symbols.png?id=61454522&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Contextual integrity failure</strong> <br />Users discovered that the AI image generator often produced biased images of people, such as showing white men as CEOs regardless of the prompt. The AI tool didn\u2019t accurately reflect the context requested by the users.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We begin by laying the cornerstone: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\" target=\"_self\">cryptographic verification</a>. Digital signatures ensure that data lineage is traceable, much like a title deed proves ownership. Decentralized identifiers act as digital passports, allowing components to prove identity independently. When the front door of our AI home recognizes visitors through their own keys rather than through a vulnerable central doorman, we create resilience in the architecture of trust.</p><p>Formal verification methods enable us to mathematically prove the structural integrity of critical components, ensuring that systems can withstand pressures placed upon them\u2014especially in high-stakes domains where lives may depend on an AI\u2019s decision.</p><p>Just as a well-designed home creates separate spaces, trustworthy AI systems are built with thoughtful compartmentalization. We don\u2019t rely on a single barrier but rather layer them to limit how problems in one area might affect others. Just as a kitchen fire is contained by fire doors and independent smoke alarms, training data is separated from the AI\u2019s inferences and output to limit the impact of any single failure or breach.</p><p>Throughout this AI home, we build transparency into the design: The equivalent of large windows that allow light into every corner is clear pathways from input to output. We install monitoring systems that continuously check for weaknesses, alerting us before small issues become catastrophic failures.</p><h3>Prompt Injection Attacks (2023\u20132024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Stylized blue bug on screen with keyboard; sad face in orange circle connected by line.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c6e75\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/stylized-blue-bug-on-screen-with-keyboard-sad-face-in-orange-circle-connected-by-line.png?id=61454587&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input integrity failure</strong> <br />Attackers embedded hidden prompts in emails, documents, and websites that hijacked AI assistants, causing them to treat malicious instructions as legitimate commands.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>But a home isn\u2019t just a physical structure, it\u2019s also the agreements we make about how to live within it. Our governance frameworks act as these shared understandings. Before welcoming new residents, we provide them with certification standards. Just as landlords conduct credit checks, we conduct integrity assessments to evaluate newcomers. And we strive to be good neighbors, aligning our community agreements with broader societal expectations.</p><p>Perhaps most important, we recognize that our AI home will shelter diverse individuals with varying needs. Our governance structures must reflect this diversity, bringing many stakeholders to the table. A truly trustworthy system cannot be designed only for its builders but must serve anyone authorized to eventually call it home.</p><p>That\u2019s how we\u2019ll create AI systems worthy of trust: not by blindly believing in their perfection but because we\u2019ve intentionally designed them with integrity controls at every level.</p><h2>A Challenge of Language</h2><p>Unlike other properties of security, like \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cprivate,\u201d we don\u2019t have a common adjective form for \u201cintegrity.\u201d This makes it hard to talk about it. It turns out that there is a word in English: \u201cintegrous.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recorded the word used in the mid-1600s but now <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/integrous_adj?tab=factsheet&amp;tl=true#210671\" target=\"_blank\">declares it obsolete</a>.</p><h3>CrowdStrike\u00a0Outage (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"Three panels: people on escalator, government building, hospital with red cross flag.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"031f4\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-panels-people-on-escalator-government-building-hospital-with-red-cross-flag.png?id=61454608&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Processing integrity failure</strong><br />A faulty software update from CrowdStrike caused 8.5 million Windows computers worldwide to crash\u2014grounding flights, shutting down hospitals, and disrupting banks.

The update, which contained a software logic error, hadn\u2019t gone through full testing protocols.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>We believe that the word needs to be revived. We need the ability to describe a system with integrity. We must be able to talk about integrous systems design.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><p>Ensuring integrity in AI presents formidable challenges. As models grow larger and more complex, maintaining integrity without sacrificing performance becomes difficult. Integrity controls often require computational resources that can slow systems down\u2014particularly challenging for real-time applications. Another concern is that emerging technologies like quantum computing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2668949802\" target=\"_self\">threaten current cryptographic protections</a>. Additionally, the distributed nature of modern AI\u2014which relies on vast ecosystems of libraries, frameworks, and services\u2014presents a large attack surface.</p><p>Beyond technology, integrity depends heavily on social factors. Companies often prioritize speed to market over robust integrity controls. Development teams may lack specialized knowledge for implementing these controls, and may find it particularly difficult to integrate them into legacy systems. And while some governments have begun establishing regulations for aspects of AI, we need worldwide alignment on governance for AI integrity.</p><h3>Voice-Clone Scams (2024)</h3><br /><img alt=\"People holding phones, speech bubble showing happiness, money, and skull emoji.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"26ea5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/people-holding-phones-speech-bubble-showing-happiness-money-and-skull-emoji.png?id=61454716&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Input and processing integrity failure</strong><br />Scammers used AI-powered voice-cloning tools to mimic the voices of victims\u2019 family members, tricking people into sending money. These scams succeeded because neither phone systems nor victims identified the AI-generated voice as fake.<br /></p><p><span>Addressing these challenges requires sustained research into verifying and enforcing integrity, as well as recovering from breaches. Priority areas include fault-tolerant algorithms for distributed learning, verifiable computation on encrypted data, techniques that maintain integrity despite adversarial attacks, and standardized metrics for certification. We also need interfaces that clearly communicate integrity status to human overseers.</span></p><p>As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the stakes for integrity have never been higher. We are entering an era where machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous agents will operate with reduced human oversight and make decisions with profound impacts.</p><p>The good news is that the tools for building systems with integrity already exist. What\u2019s needed is a shift in mind-set: from treating integrity as an afterthought to accepting that it\u2019s the core organizing principle of AI security.</p><p>The next era of technology will be defined not by what AI can do, but by whether we can trust it to know or especially to do what\u2019s right. Integrity\u2014in all its dimensions\u2014will determine the answer. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>"

But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lutnick\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> claimed that Natcast doesn\u2019t meet certain legal requirements, and therefore the contract, inked less than a week before Donald J.

And in Arizona, it plans to build a <a href=\"https://natcast.org/third-chips-for-america-rd-flagship-facility-announced\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">prototyping and packaging facility</a>.

Lutnick\u2019s legal argument for refusing payment now is that Natcast wasn\u2019t established in accordance with the Government Corporation Control Act, which lays out how government agencies establish or purchase corporations. </p><p>One person familiar with the situation who asked not to be named says that the structure of Natcast is typical of public-private partnerships and that its underpinnings were thoroughly reviewed by the Commerce Department before its establishment. What\u2019s really at issue, this person says, is Natcast\u2019s independence.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhat was set up\u2026 was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026. I think all of that has gone away with this decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were people from day one\u2026who viewed [Natcast] as very much a political entity and wanted to undo it,\u201d says this person.</p><p>In the letter, Lutnick takes aim at <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipient/deirdre-hanford/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hanford</a>, formerly a top executive at electronic design automation giant <a href=\"https://www.synopsys.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Synopsys</a>, as well as at Natcast staffers who came over from government during the Biden administration or from a volunteer <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/09/us-department-commerce-appoints-first-members-industrial-advisory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industrial advisory committee</a> that included IEEE Fellows and other chip industry leaders. Targeting such people is concerning, says one expert who preferred not to be named, because chip experts who choose to work in government or at Natcast are usually giving up more lucrative work to serve their country. It has the effect of \u201cpunishing patriotic behavior,\u201d the expert said.</p><p>Delaying the work of the NSTC by attacking Natcast is counterproductive for the U.S. chip industry, the expert added. \u201cWe are in a race, and these delays make it all the more urgent.\u201d</p><p>Commerce will likely find some way to spend the money on semiconductor R&amp;D eventually, sources agreed. One expert told <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> they have faith in NIST\u2019s ability to administer the research funding. Mark Granahan, an early proponent of the CHIPS Act and CEO of<a href=\"https://idealsemi.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Ideal Semiconductor</a>, in Bethlehem, Penn., went further. \u201cIf the administration has a different tactic but the same goal\u2026 not just independence in semiconductors but leadership\u2026 then NIST and other existing infrastructure is capable of handling things,\u201d he said.</p><p>But other sources were skeptical it would have the same impact as Natcast. \u201cWhat was set up\u2026 was always designed with a long-term strategy in mind,\u201d said one person. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get that back\u2026.

Within just a few years, dial-up had exited my life, never to return. I haven\u2019t even had a telephone line in my house for most of my adult life.</p><div class=\"badge_module shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\">\n<a class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" href=\"https://tedium.co/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"Tedium logo, a red rectangle with the word Tedium in white, above the text &quot;This post originally appeared on Tedium.&quot;\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/tedium-logo-a-red-rectangle-with-the-word-tedium-in-white-above-the-text-this-post-originally-appeared-on-tedium.png?id=60568211&amp;width=1800&amp;quality=85\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>But I still feel a strong tinge of sadness to know that AOL is <a href=\"https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">finally retiring</a> the ol\u2019 hobbyhorse. At the end of September, it\u2019s gone. The timeline is almost <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2020/10/13/eternal-september-modern-impact/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on-the-nose fitting</a>: The widespread access to the Internet AOL\u2019s service brought in the 1990s is associated with a digital phenomenon called the Eternal September. Before AOL allowed broad access to Usenet\u2014a precursor to today\u2019s online discussion forums\u2014most new users appeared each September, when new college students frequently joined the platform. Thanks to AOL, they began showing up daily starting around September 1993.</p><p>The fact that AOL\u2019s dial-up is still active in the first place highlights a truism of technology: Sometimes, the important stuff sticks around well after it\u2019s obsolete.</p><h3>Why AOL is ditching dial-up now</h3><p>It\u2019s no surprise that dial-up has lingered for close to a quarter-century. Despite not having needed a dial-up modem myself since the summer of 2001, I was once so passionate about dial-up that I begged to get a modem for my 13th birthday. Modems are hard to shake, and not just because we fondly remember waiting so long for them to do their thing.</p><p>Originally, the telephone modem was a hack. It was pushed into public consciousness <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Phone_of_Our_Own/4bgvh1lTQwcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA30&amp;printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partly by Deaf users</a> who worked around the phone industry\u2019s monopolistic regulations to develop <a href=\"https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/telephone-and-relay-services/tty-and-tty-relay-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the teletypewriter</a>, a system to communicate over phone lines via text. Along the way, the community invented technologies like the acoustic coupler.</p><p>To make that hack function, modems had to do multiple conversions in real time\u2014from data to audio and back again, in two directions. As I put it in a piece that <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/06/28/teletype-computer-evolution-history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">compared the modem to the telegraph</a>:</p><blockquote>The modem, at least in its telephone-based forms, represents a dance between sound and data. By translating information into an aural signal, then into current, then back into an aural signal, then back into data once again, the modulation and demodulation going on is very similar to the process used with the original telegraph, albeit done manually.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A retro rectangular modem that says U.S. Robotics Sportster 33.6 Faxmoden\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e814a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-retro-rectangular-modem-that-says-u-s-robotics-sportster-33-6-faxmoden.jpg?id=61508670&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Modems like this one from U.S. Robotics work by converting data to audio and back again. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Robotics_33.6K_Modem.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Jphill19/Wikimedia Commons</a></small></p>With telegraphs, the information was input by a person, translated into electric pulses, and received by another person. Modems work the same way, just without human translators. <p>The result of all this back and forth was that modems had to give up a hell of a lot of speed to make this all work. The need to connect over a medium built for audio meant that data was at risk of getting lost over the line. (This is why <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2021/01/06/error-correcting-code-memory-history/\" target=\"_blank\">error correction</a> was an essential part of the modem\u2019s evolution; often data needed to be shared more than once to ensure it got through. Without error correction, dial-up modems would be even slower.)</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Remember that sound? It marked many users\u2019 first experience getting online.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dudJjUU9Nhs&amp;t=2s\" target=\"_blank\">AdventuresinHD/YouTube</a></small></p><p>Telephone lines were a hugely inefficient system for data because they were built for voice and heavily compressed audio. Voices are still clear and recognizable after being compressed, but audio compression can wreak havoc on data connections. </p><p>Plus, there was the problem of line access. With a call, you could not easily share a connection. That meant you couldn\u2019t make phone calls while using dial-up, leading to some homes getting a second line. And at the Internet Service Provider level, having multiple lines got very complex, very fast.</p><p>The phone industry knew this, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/01/12/isdn-history-retrospective/\" target=\"_blank\">but its initial solution, ISDN</a>, did not take off among mainstream consumers. (A later one, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/inventor-of-dsl-altered-connectivity\" target=\"_blank\">DSL</a>, had better uptake, and is likely one of the few Internet options rural users currently have.)</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">In some areas of the United States, dial-up remains the best option\u2014the result of decades of poor investment in Internet infrastructure.</p><p>So the industry moved to other solutions to get consumers Internet\u2014<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ethernet-ieee-milestone\" target=\"_blank\">coaxial cable</a>, which was already widespread because of cable TV, and fiber, which wasn\u2019t. The problem is, coax never reached quite as far as telephone wires did, in part because cable television wasn\u2019t technically a utility in the way electricity or water were. </p><p><span>In recent years, many attempts have been made to classify </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/covid19-makes-clear-broadband-access-is-human-right\" target=\"_blank\">Internet access as a public utility</a><span>, though the most recent one was </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5247840/net-neutrality-fcc-struck\" target=\"_blank\">struck down by an appeals court</a><span> earlier this year. </span><span>The public utility regulation is important. The telephone had struggled to reach rural communities in the 1930s, and only did so after a series of regulations, including </span><a href=\"https://www.frs.org/history-rural-telecommunications\" target=\"_blank\">one that led to the creation</a><span> of the Federal Communications Commission, were put into effect. So too did electricity, which </span><a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2020/q1/economic_history\" target=\"_blank\">needed a dedicated law</a><span> to expand its reach.</span></p><p>But the reach of broadband is frustratingly incomplete, as highlighted by the fact that many areas of the country are not properly covered by cellular signals. And getting new wires hung can be an immensely difficult task, in part because companies that sell fiber, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/verizon-nears-the-end-of-fios-builds/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon</a> and Google, often stop investing due to the high costs. (Though, to Google\u2019s credit, <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/blog/2022/08/whats-next-for-google-fiber.html\" target=\"_blank\">it started expanding again in 2022</a> after a six-year rollback.)</p><p>So, in some areas of the United States, dial-up remains the best option\u2014the result of decades of poor investment in Internet infrastructure. This, for years, has propped up companies like AOL, which has evolved numerous times since it foolishly merged with Time Warner a quarter-century ago.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A screenshot showing a 1994 DOS AOL client\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4112a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-showing-a-1994-dos-aol-client.jpg?id=61508672&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The first PC-based client called America Online appeared on the graphical operating system GeoWorks. This screenshot shows the DOS AOL client that was distributed with GeoWorks 2.01.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ernie Smith</small></p><p>But AOL is not the company it was. After multiple acquisitions and spin-outs, it is now a mere subsidiary of Yahoo, and it long ago transitioned into a Web-first property. Oh, it still has <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/products\" target=\"_blank\">subscriptions</a>, but they\u2019re effectively fancy analogues for unnecessary security software. And their email client, while having been defeated by the likes of Gmail years ago, still has its fans. </p><p>When I posted the AOL news on social media, about 90 percent of the responses were jokes or genuine notes of respect. But there was a small contingent, maybe 5 percent, that talked about how much this was going to screw over far-flung communities. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s AOL\u2019s responsibility to keep this model going forever.</p><p>Instead, it looks like the job is going to fall to two companies: Microsoft, whose <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/msn-dial-up-internet-access/CFQ7TTC0KGVG/\" target=\"_blank\">MSN Dial-Up Internet Access</a> costs US $179.95 per year, and the company <a href=\"https://www.unitedonline.net/company/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">United Online</a>, which still operates the longtime dial-up players Juno and NetZero. Satellite Internet is also an option, with older services like HughesNet and newer ones like Starlink picking up the slack.</p><p>It\u2019s not AOL\u2019s fault. But AOL is the face of this failing.</p><h3>AOL dropping dial-up is part of a long fade-out</h3><p>As technologies go, the dial-up modem has not lasted quite as long as the telegram, which has been active in one form or another for 181 years. But the modem, which was first used in 1958 as <a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/about/history/sage-semi-automatic-ground-environment-air-defense-system\" target=\"_blank\">part of an air-defense system</a>, has stuck around for a good 67 years. That makes it one of the oldest pieces of computer-related technology still in modern use.</p><p>To give you an idea of how old that is: 1958 is also the year that the <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2018/01/25/soldering-technology-history/\" target=\"_blank\">integrated circuit</a>, an essential building block of any modern computer, was invented. The disk platter, which became the modern <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2022/02/18/early-hard-drive-history/\" target=\"_blank\">hard drive</a>, was invented a year earlier. The <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2023/11/17/3m-floppy-disks-history/\" target=\"_blank\">floppy disk</a> came a decade later.</p><p>(It should be noted that the modem itself is not dying\u2014your smartphone has one\u2014but the connection your landline has to your modem, the really loud one, has seen better days.)</p><p>The news that AOL is dropping its service might be seen as the end of the line for dial-up, but the story of the telegram hints that this may not be the case. In 2006, much hay was made about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2006/02/02/5186113/western-union-sends-its-last-telegram\" target=\"_blank\">Western Union sending its final telegram</a>. But Western Union was never the only company sending telegrams, and another company picked up the business. You can still send a telegram via <a href=\"https://itelegram.com\" target=\"_blank\">International Telegram</a> in 2025. (It\u2019s not cheap: A single message, sent the same day, is $34, plus 75 cents per word.)</p><p>In many ways, AOL dropping the service is a sign that this already niche use case is going to get more niche. <span>But niche use cases have a way of staying relevant, given the right audience. It\u2019s sort of like why doctors continue to use pagers. As </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1197955913/doctors-pagers-beepers\" target=\"_blank\">a Planet Money episode</a><span> from two years ago </span>noted<span>, the additional friction of using pagers worked well with the way doctors functioned, because it ensured that they knew the messages they were getting didn\u2019t compete with anything else.</span></p><p>Dial-up is likely never going to totally die, unless the landline phone system itself gets knocked offline, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/12/04/att-eliminate-traditional-landline-copper-phone-service-2029/76765766007/\" target=\"_blank\">which AT&amp;T has admittedly been itching to do</a>. It remains one of the cheapest options to get online, outside of drinking a single coffee at a Panera and logging onto the wifi.</p><p>But AOL? While dial-up may have been the company\u2019s primary business earlier in its life, it hasn\u2019t really been its focus in quite a long time. AOL is now a highly diversified company, whose primary focus over the past 15 years has been advertising. It still sells subscriptions, but those subscriptions are about to lose their most important legacy feature.</p><p>AOL is simply too weak to support the next generation of Internet service themselves. Their inroad to broadband was supposed to be Time Warner Cable; that didn\u2019t work out, so they pivoted to something else, but kept around the legacy business while it was still profitable. It\u2019s likely that emerging technologies, like <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/airband-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft\u2019s Airband Initiative</a>, which relies on distributing broadband over unused \u201cwhite spaces\u201d on the television dial, stand a better shot. 5G connectivity will also likely improve over time (T-Mobile <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-brings-5g-home-internet-to-nearly-five-million-more-homes\" target=\"_blank\">already promotes its 5G home Internet</a> as a rural option), and perhaps more satellite-based options will emerge.</p><p>Technologies don\u2019t die. They just slowly become so irrelevant that they might as well be dead.</p><h3>The monoculture of the AOL login experience</h3><p>When I posted the announcement, hidden in an obscure link on the AOL website sent to me by a colleague, it immediately went viral on Bluesky and Mastodon.</p><p>That meant I got to see a lot of people react to this news in real time. Most had the same comment: I didn\u2019t even know it was still around. Others made modem jokes, or talked about AOL\u2019s famously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vO8OpbCvs\" target=\"_blank\">terrible customer service</a>. What was interesting was that most people said roughly the same thing about the service.</p><p>That is not the case with most online experiences, which usually reflect myriad points of views. I think it speaks to the fact that while the Internet was the ultimate monoculture killer, the experience of getting online for the first time was largely monocultural. Usually, it started with a modem connecting to a phone number and dropping us into a single familiar place. <span></span></p><p>We have lost a lot of Internet Service Providers over the years. Few spark the passion and memories of America Online, a network that somehow beat out more innovative and more established players to become the onramp to the Information Superhighway, for all the good and bad that represents.</p><p>AOL must be embarrassed of that history. It barely even announced its closure.</p>"

This often leads to a misdiagnosis.\u201d</p><p>She developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system that uses a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization process, enhancing CT images by amplifying contrast and limiting image grain.

Encased in titanium, the batteries for these devices contained a radioactive isotope\u2014typically about a tenth of a gram of plutonium-238\u2014and could operate for decades without maintenance. The invention provided relief to a population of people who previously needed surgery every few years to change out their pacemaker\u2019s chemical battery.</p><p>As time went on, though, the whereabouts of these radioactive tickers became increasingly difficult to track. In the United States, the devices were supposed to be returned to the U.S. Department of Energy for plutonium recovery. But often, that didn\u2019t happen. Doctors changed jobs, manufacturers went out of business, patients died, and families forgot about their loved one\u2019s pacemaker. Too often, the radioactive material landed in crematoriums and coffins.</p><p>Uncomfortable with the situation, regulators worldwide nixed the devices. The last known nuclear-powered pacemaker was implanted in 1988. After that, aside from a few specialty uses, such as deep-space probes and Siberian lighthouses, development and deployment of nuclear batteries effectively came to a halt.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Two human hands using instruments to manipulate the pieces of a small metal object labeled as radioactive\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cea8b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Medtronic\u2019s 1970 Laurens-Alcatel pulse generator powered pacemakers with plutonium-238. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Smith Collection/Getty Images </small></p><p>Technology never truly dies, and nuclear batteries are no exception. Research <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-daintiest-dynamos\" target=\"_self\">grew active again after 2000</a>, although it lacked commercial translation. But over the last year, a host of companies and research groups around the world have announced advances that they say will invigorate the technology and extend its use to robots, drones, sensors, and solar farms, as well as spacecraft and biomedical implants.</p><p>The new groups are employing modern, more-exotic technology that goes beyond the designs of the past, allowing them to pursue the finest nuclear batteries ever made. As with the first generation, the allure of nuclear batteries is still their extraordinarily long life-spans: several decades and, with proper fuel choice, possibly centuries. They could also deliver more energy in packages that weigh less than those of chemical batteries.</p><p>The question is, who\u2019s going to buy them? I\u2019ve been involved in this sector for nearly 40 years as a nuclear engineer, professor, and consultant. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed: The technology works, it has many advantages over chemical batteries, and it can be utilized safely. But what very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. Part of the problem is that there is no good solution to the need to track these sources and make sure they are disposed of properly at the end of the battery\u2019s life.</p><p>There are more companies working out the challenges now than I\u2019ve ever seen in my career, and that\u2019s good for the field\u2014it helps ground the academic research. And it gives me hope that this could be the moment when nuclear batteries finally flourish.</p><h2>How Do Nuclear Batteries Work?  </h2><p>The term \u201cnuclear batteries\u201d may evoke images of tiny nuclear reactors, but that\u2019s not how they work. Nuclear batteries don\u2019t split atoms with neutron bombardment. Instead, they capture energy in the form of radiation that\u2019s spontaneously released when atomic nuclei decay.</p><p>Most research groups developing nuclear batteries are focused on harnessing energy from radioactive isotopes of nickel and hydrogen. In many nuclear battery designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation released by the radioisotopes\u2019 nuclei and convert it to an electric current, much like a solar cell does. In other designs, thermoelectric devices convert the heat produced by the emitted radiation to electricity. So \u201cradioisotope power source\u201d is a better descriptor than \u201cnuclear battery,\u201d but for ease of language, I\u2019ll use these terms interchangeably.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A coin-shaped metal object displaying a radioactive symbol and other details about its contents \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7d529\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Infinity Power uses a novel electrochemical process to convert the radioactive decay of nickel-63 into electricity. The company says it can scale the technology from microwatts to megawatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Infinity Power </small></p><p>On the heels of some laboratory successes, researchers are racing to commercialize these devices. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority\" target=\"_blank\">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> (UKAEA), Miami-based <a href=\"https://citylabs.net/\" target=\"_blank\">City Labs</a>, Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co., and China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nwnu.edu.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">Northwest Normal University</a> have all announced advances and funding in semiconductor-based nuclear batteries over the last two years, some with plans to commercialize. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.infinitypower.energy/\" target=\"_blank\">Infinity Power</a>, in San Diego, announced a novel electrochemical approach to converting radioisotope energy.</p><p>What markets these batteries will find\u2014if they can be commercialized\u2014will depend largely on cost, safety, and licensing issues. One of the most compelling applications is in uncrewed spacecraft for long-distance missions, which require decades of reliable power. Solar power works for missions close to the sun, but by the time a spacecraft gets to Jupiter, the available solar irradiance drops below 4 percent of that on Earth.</p><p>That leaves nuclear fission and radioisotope power as the only viable options for deep-space missions. Fission is ideal for larger power needs in space, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-nuclear-reactor-nasa-moon?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=hero&amp;utm_campaign=2025-08-22&amp;utm_content=hero1\" target=\"_blank\">like NASA\u2019s proposed 100-kilowatt lunar nuclear reactor</a>. But for lower, onboard power needs, nuclear batteries offer simpler designs and lower mass. The current radioisotope workhorse in space is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, which produces a few hundred watts.</p><h2>Radioisotopes: Not Just for Nuclear-Powered Pacemakers </h2><p>NASA\u2019s two Voyager missions, launched in 1977, each carry three RTGs that weigh about 38 kilograms, including 4.5 kg of plutonium-238. They\u2019re cylindrical and about the size of an office wastebasket. They initially produced 157 watts of electric power, but that drops over time as the plutonium-238 decays. A 157-W Voyager-based RTG that launched in 1977 will produce about 88 W today.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Two cylindrical metal machines stacked on top of each other in a cinder block room\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"607f2\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980\" /><h3></h3><br /><p>Another good use for nuclear batteries is to supply power in remote locations on Earth. Beginning in the 1970s, for example, the Soviet Union deployed over 1,000 RTGs in northwestern Russia to power its uncrewed lighthouses, radio beacons, and weather stations. Most of these batteries ran on strontium-90, and each weighed about 2,000 kg. The United States has deployed hundreds of similar systems for remote power both on land and on the ocean floor, particularly for <a href=\"http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/ota-bp-eti-129.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remote monitoring sites in the Arctic</a>.</p><p>While nuclear batteries have proved successful for space exploration, remote power, and pacemakers, no new uses for these long-lived batteries have emerged. Many devices would benefit from long-lived batteries\u2014imagine a wireless tire pressure sensor that lasts the life of a car, for example. But the risks and costs of opting for a radioactive battery would have to be balanced against the benefits.</p><p>Another factor working against the widespread use of nuclear batteries is the need to track the fuel. In just about any country, the sellers and buyers of any such batteries intended for the general public would need to be licensed (see box, \u201cBoy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale\u201d). The buyer also typically takes on the burden of tracking and disposing of the material. Keeping tabs on radioactive material is a necessity, but this adds complexity to applications involving the general public.</p><h3>Boy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale</h3><br /><p>In just about any country, buyers of radioisotope fuel sources must be licensed\u2014with some exceptions. In the United States, for example, you don\u2019t need a license for some radioisotopes if the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part030/part030-0071.html\" target=\"_blank\">quantity is below a certain level</a> set by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Many smoke detectors contain about 1 microcurie, or 37,000 becquerels, of americium-241, which is below the exception limit of 5 \u00b5Ci (185,000 Bq). (The radioisotope ionizes the air within the detector, and the alarm is triggered when the presence of smoke alters the ionization rate.)</p><p>The exemption quantities are too small for even the smallest nuclear battery\u2014unless someone starts up a collection. That\u2019s just what <a href=\"https://inis.iaea.org/records/vpjmt-6nz83\" target=\"_blank\">a young man in Michigan</a> in the 1990s did. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he attempted to build a neutron generator by collecting americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping-lantern mantles, radium from old clocks, and tritium from gunsights. He amassed so much radioactive material that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared his home a Superfund hazardous waste clean-up site.</p><p>But the benefits of radioisotopes are profound, and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to use them with proper care. They\u2019re used worldwide on a daily basis primarily for medical imaging and cancer therapy. They\u2019re also used as tracers to monitor fluid flow and detect leaks, for nondestructive inspection of welds, and for explosive detection.\u2014J.B.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>One new use where the benefits may outweigh the risks and costs is providing longer-lived power to soldiers\u2014something the U.S. military has explored. Soldiers\u2019 missions often take them to remote or unstable locations where electricity may be unavailable, preventing them from charging their equipment. This forces soldiers to carry batteries, the weight and life of which limit their missions. Small nuclear batteries would provide a lightweight alternative\u2014potentially 1/100 the weight\u2014due to their higher energy density relative to that of chemical batteries. But they would need to be encased to shield soldiers from the radiation, and designed to withstand harsh conditions, which would add weight.</p><p>Another potential new use for nuclear batteries is to power autonomous sensors or robots that communicate, move, or fly. One compelling use would be <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-robot-2671447539\" target=\"_self\">insect-size flying microdrones</a> for civilian and military purposes. But collecting them at the end of their flights might be difficult and would also leave tiny bits of radioactive material littering the landscape.</p><h2>Engineering Challenges: Betavoltaics Versus Alphavoltaics</h2><p>Let\u2019s turn to the engineering challenges of commercializing a miniature nuclear battery. In general, taking a promising battery technology from the lab to mass production is a complex process that\u2019s more likely to end in failure than success. With nuclear batteries, it involves negotiating a lot of trade-offs between cost, power, safety, and life-span.</p><p>First, you have to pick the fuel\u2014that is, an isotope of an element that will release radiation as it decays. Such isotopes emit three types of radiation: gamma rays, beta particles, and alpha particles. Gamma rays are short-wavelength electromagnetic waves that can travel deep into most solids, including living tissue. They\u2019re difficult to contain and capture, so gamma-emitting isotopes are typically avoided.</p><h3>Table 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u00a0</h3><br /><table border=\"0\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Isotope</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Type</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Maximum decay energy<br />(kiloelectron volt)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\"> Half-life (year)</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30; text-align: center;\">Specific power (watts per gram)</th></tr><tr><td> Tritium</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">19</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">12.3</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.33</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Carbon-14</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">156</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,730</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.0013</td></tr><tr><td>Nickel-63</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">67</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">100</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.0058</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Promethium-147</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">beta</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">225</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">2.6</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.41</td></tr><tr><td>Polonium-210</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">5,305</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">0.38</td><td style=\"text-align: center;\">141</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Plutonium-238</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">alpha</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">5,593</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">87.7</td><td style=\"background-color: #fdeebd; text-align: center;\">0.56</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"photo-credit\">Credit/source: Jake Blanchard</p><p class=\"caption\">Radioisotopes emit particles with a spectrum of energies. The decay energy is a measure of the kinetic energy of emitted particles as the radioisotope decays. The specific power provided here is a measure of how much power an ideal, pure radioisotope source can generate per unit of mass at the beginning of its life.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Pure beta or alpha emitters are a better choice for nuclear batteries. Beta particles are electrons that have an intermediate penetration range in solids. Their decay energies go from a few kiloelectron volts (for tritium, or hydrogen-3) to a few megaelectron volts (for yttrium-90). Alpha particles, by contrast, are emitted at a higher energy than beta particles\u2014typically around 5 MeV\u2014and can\u2019t penetrate a piece of paper. But they can damage semiconductors by creating defects as they collide with the nuclei in the device. This makes alpha emitters best suited for non-semiconductor battery technologies that convert the heat generated by the source fuel into electricity.</p><p>Radioisotopes of nickel, carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, promethium, polonium, and plutonium all emit beta or alpha particles and are good options for nuclear batteries (see \u201cTable 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries\u201d). Which one to choose depends on several factors, including the isotope\u2019s half-life and its decay energy.</p><p>For the longest battery life, you\u2019ll want a radioisotope with a long half-life, because the battery\u2019s output power will drop by a factor of two over each half-life. That means a tritium-fueled device will lose half its power every 12 years, while a plutonium-238 battery will lose half its power every 88 years.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>What very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If your goal is instead to maximize the battery\u2019s power density\u2014such as for an insect-size microdrone\u2014then you\u2019ll need one with a short half-life<strong>.</strong> For example, polonium-210 has a half-life of a few months, but a power density of 141 watts per gram, which could give it enough power to carry its payload. The short half-life would mean it would work only for a few months and would completely decay within a couple of years. But for a microdrone that will probably be abandoned somewhere, perhaps that\u2019s a good thing. (Note that these power densities account for thermal power, but there are losses in converting to electricity, so the output power density of any devices created using this fuel will be lower.)</p><p>The safest nuclear battery fuels are tritium and nickel-63, because they produce low-energy beta particles that are easier to shield and less damaging to semiconductors than alpha particles. Pure tritium can be challenging to work with because it\u2019s a gas at room temperature. It can be converted into a metal hydride, but this process, which involves mixing it with stable isotopes, decreases its energy density. Another design consideration is that the lower penetration depth of these safer, low-energy <a href=\"https://blanchard.engr.wisc.edu/purebeta.htm\" target=\"_blank\">beta emitters</a> requires that the sources be made very thin, or else the particles will never reach the battery\u2019s semiconductor.</p><p>What about supply and cost? All radioisotopes are expensive to procure and are typically only available in small quantities. Just about any of them can be made during nuclear fission by placing a dedicated target material in the reactor core. They can also be made using particle accelerators. Some types of radioisotopes can be obtained from spent nuclear fuel. But none of these options is simple or inexpensive, because every step requires the handling of radioactive materials.</p><p>One gram of tritium costs about US $30,000 and will produce a thermal power of about 0.3 W, which would in turn typically produce an electric power of only a few milliwatts. The supply of plutonium-238 is so limited that NASA must set its launch schedule according to the availability of the fuel. As a result, NASA is pursuing americium-241 as an alternative. It\u2019s unclear how these costs would change if the market for these materials grows substantially.</p><h2>How to Convert Radioisotope Power Sources</h2><p>After choosing a fuel, you have to select a conversion technology. Early radioisotope power sources developed in the 1950s simply collected the charged decay particles, producing an electric potential difference between the collector and the source\u2014that is, a voltage\u2014that could then be tapped to produce electricity. The current in these designs was inherently low, and so the battery had to be run at a high voltage (in the kilovolts) to achieve a reasonable conversion efficiency, which proved too challenging.</p><p>To get around this problem, you can use a semiconductor to turn each charged particle emitted by the source into thousands of charge carriers, allowing the device to run at a few volts instead of a few kilovolts. The physics of such a device is essentially that of a solar cell, except that the source of the radiation is from a radioisotope instead of the sun. When the radioisotope is a beta-particle emitter, we call the device \u201cbetavoltaic.\u201d</p><h3>Three Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u00a0</h3><br /><p><span>As radioactive isotopes decay, their nuclei spontaneously release energy in the form of radiation</span>. The energy can be captured, converted into electricity, and stored, creating a nuclear battery. In common designs, adjacent semiconductors absorb the radiation and convert it to an electric current, or thermoelectric devices convert the heat that radioisotopes produce to electricity. But more-exotic techniques such as radioluminescent, thermionic, and thermophotovoltaic conversion are also being explored.  </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of light and energy transfer from radioactive to photovoltaic systems.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"09f7f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-light-and-energy-transfer-from-radioactive-to-photovoltaic-systems.png?id=61488113&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Radioluminescent conversion</strong></p><p>In this approach, a scintillator, such as a cerium-doped lutetium aluminum crystal, is exposed to ionizing radiation from the isotope, causing it to emit light. The light is captured and converted to electricity with a photovoltaic cell, which can be tuned to the frequency of the emitted light to improve conversion efficiency. But the light production itself is inefficient.</p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Diagram of a heat engine showing heat flow and electron movement in a plasma-filled gap.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"7136b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-of-a-heat-engine-showing-heat-flow-and-electron-movement-in-a-plasma-filled-gap.png?id=61488106&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermionic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This concept uses the radioisotope to produce a hot surface (typically above 1,500</span> \u00b0C), which then releases electrons via thermionic emission. The source is heated as the emitted particles deposit their kinetic energy in the solid through interactions with the source atoms. The electrons emitted by the surface can be collected to produce a potential and a current source. Conversion efficiency can reach 20 percent, but achieving the necessary temperatures requires large sources, so this technology is only appropriate for high-power applications. </p><h3></h3><br /><img alt=\"Heat-to-electricity conversion diagram using thermophotovoltaic (TPV) technology.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"49131\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/heat-to-electricity-conversion-diagram-using-thermophotovoltaic-tpv-technology.png?id=61488098&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>Thermophotovoltaic Conversion</strong></p><p><span>This strategy uses </span>a radioisotope to produce a hot surface, and electromagnetic radiation from the hot surface produces electricity within a photovoltaic cell. To obtain good efficiencies, these devices must run very hot\u2014around 2,000\u00b0C for a conversion efficiency of 29 percent.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Under development since the 1950s, betavoltaic batteries feature a radioactive emitter and a silicon-diode absorber. As the emitter naturally decays, electrons (in the form of beta particles) strike the absorber. This creates a cascade of electron-hole pairs, which occur when electrons are removed from their original position, leaving a \u201chole\u201d that generates a small but stable supply of electric current. This process is similar to that of a solar cell, where light produces the electron-hole pairs.</p><p>Betavoltaic batteries with silicon diodes have conversion efficiencies of a few percent, and up to 10 percent with silicon carbide, and can typically operate at around 1 volt. Some models indicate that this <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9936597\" target=\"_blank\">efficiency can be as high as 23.5 percent</a>. Recent research on betavoltaics uses diamond semiconductors, which offer even higher conversion efficiencies due to their higher bandgap.</p><p>Betavoltaics are solid-state, simple, and relatively inexpensive, so they offer an ideal way to produce a low-power option (less than about a milliwatt) for nuclear batteries. They can be used to create higher-power devices, but in those cases it\u2019s often better to switch to an alpha emitter to achieve a higher power density. However, because the alpha particles will damage a semiconductor, their use generally requires a conversion option that relies on heat converted to electricity.</p><p>For example, NASA uses thermoelectric conversion in its RTGs, which have been used to power not only <em>Voyager 1</em> and <em>2</em>, but also two Mars rovers and over <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rps-fleet.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">40 other NASA missions</a>. If you\u2019ve seen the movie <em>The Martian</em>, you may recall how Matt Damon\u2019s character, trapped alone on Mars, used an RTG: He needed a heat source to stay warm while traveling in a rover, so he dug up an old RTG from a previous mission and placed it inside his vehicle.</p><p>To convert the heat to electricity, the RTGs employ a series of thermocouples, which consist of a junction of two dissimilar conductors. These components produce a potential in the presence of a temperature gradient (via what\u2019s known as the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/how-does-a-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-rtg-work-the-seebeck-effect/#:~:text=The%20scientist%2C%20Thomas%20Seebeck%2C%20found,of%20compounds%20known%20as%20semiconductors.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seebeck</a> effect). The pacemakers of the 1970s also relied on thermoelectric conversion, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p>Other, more-exotic conversion techniques include radioluminescent conversion, thermionic conversion, and thermophotovoltaic conversion (see sidebar, \u201cThree Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity\u201d), all of which work well in the lab but require higher operating temperatures or have degradation issues. Most companies are focused on developing betavoltaic technology because it permits the use of the safer beta emitters.</p><h2>Who Is Developing Nuclear Batteries?</h2><p>Since the invention of small betavoltaic power sources in the 1970s, the vast majority of research on nuclear batteries has focused on power levels of less than 1 microwatt (see \u201cTable 2: Who\u2019s Developing Nuclear Batteries\u201d). To date, many of these efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.betavolt.tech/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</a> says it has a 100-\u00b5W battery that\u2019s about the size of a cereal square (15 by 15 by 5 millimeters) and can last 50 years. The company is working with betavoltaics using nickel-63, tritium, promethium-147, and strontium-90, and a diamond semiconductor to convert the energy to electricity.</p><h3>Table 2: Who\u2019s Developing Nuclear Batteries\u00a0\u00a0</h3><br /><table border=\"1\" style=\"white-space: unset;\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">        Company/research group (location)</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Radioisotope</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">        Conversion technology</th><th align=\"left\" scope=\"col\" style=\"color: ##ffffff; background-color: #ffcd30;\">Goals and accomplishments</th></tr><tr><td>Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</td><td>Nickel-63</td><td>Betavoltaic with diamond diode semiconductor</td><td>100-microwatt battery; planning a 1-watt version for commercial launch</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\"><a href=\"https://www.arkenlight.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> Arkenlight</a> (Bristol, England)</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Carbon-14 and tritium</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Betavoltaic with diamond diode semiconductor</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Exploring use in satellites, medical implants, industrial sensors, and luxury watches</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.dgist.ac.kr/eng/index.do\" target=\"_blank\"> Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology</a> (Daegu, South Korea)</td><td>Carbon-14</td><td>Betavoltaic with titanium dioxide semiconductor sensitized with ruthenium dye</td><td>Presented results at American Chemical Society spring meeting, March 2025</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\"><a href=\"https://citylabs.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> City Labs</a> (Miami)</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Tritium</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Betavoltaic</td><td align=\"left\" style=\"background-color: #fdeebd;\">Focused on space, deep ocean, and medical applications; 20-year battery life</td></tr><tr><td>Northwest Normal University (Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China) and <a href=\"http://www.beitalab.com/company.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wuxi Beita Pharmatech</a> Co.

Potential applications include aerospace, medical implants, wearable devices, MEMS systems, advanced sensors, small drones, miniature robots, law-enforcement equipment, and fire-safety remote communication.</p><p>Assuming Beijing Betavolt\u2019s device has a conversion efficiency of about 5 percent, the battery would have to hold about 20 curies, or 740 billion becquerels (0.4 grams), of nickel-63. This is well above the typical amount of nickel-63 available on the market, which is normally in the millicurie range.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">To date, many efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there\u2019s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p>Infinity Power also uses nickel-63 in its coin-size battery, but may need less of it because of the novel electrochemical conversion process it has developed. The company says its conversion efficiency exceeds 60 percent\u2014about six times as efficient as the best radioisotope power generators.</p><p>In Infinity\u2019s design, the isotope is dissolved or suspended in a proprietary liquid electrolyte. The decay of the radioisotope produces high-energy beta particles that ionize the electrolyte, creating a potential difference between the anode and cathode immersed in the solution and driving electron flow through an external circuit to produce electricity.</p><p>Academic and government researchers are also pursuing nuclear batteries. The University of Bristol, in England, and the UKAEA last year announced they had developed a battery fueled by carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. With carbon-14\u2019s half-life of 5,700 years, the battery could theoretically last for millennia. The U.K. has an ample supply of the fuel because it can be scavenged from the country\u2019s graphite-moderated, gas-cooled fission reactors. Carbon-14 produces beta particles with a maximum energy of 156 kiloelectron volt, which should be low enough to prevent damage to the battery\u2019s diamond semiconductor.</p><p>Meanwhile, a collaboration of researchers in China published a report in the December 2024 <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science</em></em> on a <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709846/authors#authors\" target=\"_blank\">radioluminescent nuclear battery</a>. The team used an X-ray source, which emits electromagnetic radiation, to mimic a beta source, which emits electrons, to help them understand how the device might perform. The X-ray photons excited two inorganic scintillators, causing them to emit light, and a commercial silicon photodiode converted the light to electricity.</p><p>The products envisioned by these startups offer great promise. The key to their lasting success will be identifying markets in which the benefits of nuclear batteries outweigh the challenges. The market for these devices in space applications is strong, but whether new markets will arise remains to be seen. <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p><p><em>Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Yu-Tzu Chiu, who contributed reporting for this article.</em></p>"

By leveraging algebraic properties and periodicities, the FFT reduced the number of the operations, making it particularly and practically feasible for everyday tasks, replacing the less efficient analog methods.\u201d</p><h2>A new mathematical tool</h2><p>In 1963 Tukey, a professor of mathematics and statistics at Princeton, participated in a meeting of U.S. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Science_Advisory_Committee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science Advisory Committee</a> to discuss ways to detect underground nuclear tests, according to the ETHW entry.</p><p>Also attending that meeting was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/richard-garwin\" target=\"_self\">Richard Garwin</a>, a physicist and engineer at <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/richard-garwin-obituary\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a> who played a key role in designing the first hydrogen bomb. He died in May. Read about his fascinating life in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/richard-garwin-hydrogen-bomb-obituary\" target=\"_self\">In Memoriam</a>. </p><p>Tukey told Garwin he was working on speeding up the computation of an existing method\u2014the Fourier transform\u2014thinking it might help with the detection.

That person was Cooley, a research staff member working on numerical analysis and computation projects.</p><p>If the Fourier transform could be made faster, Garwin said, <a href=\"https://ethw.org/James_W._Cooley#:~:text=He%20suggested%20the%20idea%20of,and%20an%20IEEE%20Centennial%20medal.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">seismometers could be planted in the ground</a> in countries surrounding the Soviet Union to detect nuclear explosions from atomic bomb tests, because the Soviets wouldn\u2019t allow on-site tests, according to Cooley\u2019s <a href=\"https://ethw.org/Oral-History:James_W._Cooley#Tukey,_Garwin_and_FFT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">oral history</a> in the Engineering and Technology History Wiki.

This process is time consuming, labor intensive, and prone to communication breakdowns that can complicate emergency responses.</p><div class=\"badge_module shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\">\n<a class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"Universe Today logo; text reads &quot;This post originally appeared on Universe Today.&quot;\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/universe-today-logo-text-reads-this-post-originally-appeared-on-universe-today.png?id=60568425&amp;width=1800&amp;quality=85\" /></a>\n</div>\n<p>That is where the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris/CREAM_avoiding_collisions_in_space_through_automation\" target=\"_blank\">Collision Risk Estimation and Automated Mitigation</a> (CREAM) project comes in. It aims to revolutionize this chaotic process by automating most collision-avoidance activities. The system can evaluate potential crashes, generate precise maneuver plans, and support decision-making with minimal human intervention. Think of it as an air traffic control system for space, but with artificial intelligence handling much of the complex coordination.</p><h2>An AI Negotiator</h2><p>One of CREAM\u2019s most innovative features is its ability to connect different types of organizations involved in space operations. Satellite operators, space-monitoring services, regulators, and observers can all communicate through the system, streamlining what was previously a fragmented and often frustrating process.</p><p>The system goes even further by facilitating negotiations between operators when potential collisions involve two active satellites rather than debris. If operators disagree on the best solution, CREAM can refer the dispute to mediation services, ensuring fair and transparent resolution.</p><p>Currently, CREAM exists as a ground-based prototype system developed by <a href=\"https://www.gmv.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">GMV</a>, a Spanish private capital interest group, and <a href=\"https://guardtime.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Guardtime</a>, an Estonian data-management company. This version can already provide collision alerts and generate actionable avoidance maneuvers that ground crews can implement. However, the real breakthrough will come when CREAM moves into orbit itself.</p><p>The project is preparing for expanded pilot testing while simultaneously developing space-based versions. These include \u201cpiggyback missions\u201d where CREAM will ride aboard other spacecraft as a digital payload, plus a dedicated demonstration mission to test the system\u2019s capabilities in the harsh environment of space.</p><p>Beyond preventing immediate collisions, CREAM addresses a fundamental challenge in space governance. Establishing \u201crules of the road\u201d for space traffic has always faced a chicken and egg problem; you need both international agreement on the rules and the technology to enforce them.</p><p>CREAM provides that missing technological foundation. The system offers standardized tools that help operators follow best practices while giving regulators ways to monitor compliance. Its flexible design allows nontechnical users to update standards and rules as international norms evolve. This adaptability ensures CREAM will remain relevant as space technology advances and new challenges emerge. Rather than becoming obsolete, the system can grow and adapt alongside our expanding presence in space.</p>"

In a world where technology is increasingly integrated into every aspect of our lives\u2014from industrial robots to autonomous vehicles\u2014the potential for harm from product malfunctions makes functional safety not just important, but critical. </span></p><p>This webinar cuts through the complexity to provide a clear understanding of what functional safety truly entails and why it\u2019s critical for product success. We\u2019ll start by defining functional safety not by its often-confusing official terms, but as a structured methodology for managing risk through defined engineering processes, essential product design requirements, and probabilistic analysis. The \u201cnorth star\u201d goals? To ensure your <span>product not only works reliably but, if it does fail, it does so in a safe and predictable manner.</span></p><p>We\u2019ll dive into two fundamental concepts: the <span>Safety Lifecycle, a detailed engineering process focused on design quality to minimize systematic failures, and Probabilistic, Performance-Based Design using reliability metrics to minimize random hardware failures. You\u2019ll learn about IEC 61508, the foundational standard for functional safety, and how numerous industry-specific standards derive from it.</span></p><p>The webinar will walk you through the Engineering Design phases: analyzing hazards and required <span>risk reduction, realizing optimal designs, and ensuring safe operation. We\u2019ll demystify the Performance Concept and the critical Safety Integrity Level (SIL), explaining its definition, criteria (systematic capability, architectural constraints, PFD), and how it relates to industry-specific priorities.</span></p><p>Discover key Design Verification techniques like DFMEA/DDMA and FMEDA, emphasizing how these tools help identify and address problems early in development. We\u2019ll detail the <span>FMEDA technique showing how design decisions directly impact predictions like safe and dangerous failure rates, diagnostic coverage, and useful life. Finally, we\u2019ll cover Functional Safety Certification, explaining its purpose, process, and what adjustments to your development process can set you up for success.</span></p><p><span><span><a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/749990?utm_source=Wiley&amp;utm_medium=Spectrum\" target=\"_blank\">Register now for this free webinar!</a></span></span></p>"

As a youngster growing up in Chennai, India, Pandy loved acting and dancing, but he also excelled in math and science in school.</p><p>His parents, both educators, supported their son\u2019s passion but encouraged him to consider studying engineering. They told him that if engineering didn\u2019t work out, he could always try show business.</p><h3>Gokul Pandy</h3><br /><p><strong>Employer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Accenture in Richmond, Va.</p><p><strong>Title: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Application development manager</p><p><strong>Member grade: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Senior member</p><p><strong>Alma maters: </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Anand Institute of Higher Technology, Chennai, India; Alagappa University, in Karaikudi, India</p><h3></h3><br /><p>He took their advice and, as a high school student, began watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> videos of engineers solving real-world problems. Those videos inspired him to enroll in the engineering program at <a href=\"https://aiht.ac.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Anand Institute of Higher Technology</a>, in Chennai. During his second year there, a career in engineering won out over one in entertainment. His engineering career has had its challenges, however.</p><p>Today, Pandy is an application development manager at <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" target=\"_blank\">Accenture</a>, in Richmond, Va. The IEEE senior member also serves as the chair of the <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Richmond Section</a>.</p><p>He was inducted this month into the <a href=\"https://hkn.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE\u2013Eta Kappa Nu</a> honor society.</p><h2>From IT support to robotic automation expert</h2><p>Pandy graduated from Anand in 2008 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communications engineering. It was at the height of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Great Recession</a>, which began in 2007 and ended in 2009. Many countries, including India, had high unemployment rates then, making it tougher to find a full-time job.

Today\u2019s young adults want everything instantly\u2014which isn\u2019t realistic in the workplace. </li><li>Keep learning. Today\u2019s technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are evolving quickly, and you need to stay on top of the latest innovations. </li><li>Don\u2019t wait for the perfect opportunity; rather, create it. </li><li>Don\u2019t view yourself as \u201cjust\u201d a software engineer or \u201cjust\u201d an associate engineer. Go the extra mile, even if you aren\u2019t paid to do so. That way, you\u2019ll always be one step ahead of the competition. </li><li>Build solutions that will have a real-world impact, not just theoretical value. Theoretical value is good to study, but make the application practical. When you do practical work, you\u2019ll come to know the difficulties, the failures, and the pros and cons.</li><li>Staying true to yourself will help you grow in your career.</li><li>Stay humble, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they are silly.</li><li>Get involved in a professional organization, such as IEEE, early in your career. You\u2019ll get to know about cutting-edge technologies, meet great leaders, and pick up skills that will help your career.</li></ul><p><span>\u201cIEEE stays updated on the frontier of technologies and gives back to the engineering community,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt also provides services to students and initiates talks where we can explore topics with respect to our skills and knowledge, and mentor others.\u201d</span></p><p>Interested in volunteering and mentoring, he decided to nominate himself for the position of IEEE Richmond Section chair. The section has more than 800 members and covers six cities and 26 counties.</p><p>Being chair is his first volunteer leadership position. He says he believed that running the section would enhance his leadership skills. Winning the election \u201cwas a miracle,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was another enrichment opportunity for my career.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/about/excom-2/\" target=\"_blank\">He began his term in January</a> and was initially anxious about the additional workload, he says, but so far his term has been an \u201camazing experience.\u201d He credits IEEE Senior Member <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenjjones/\" target=\"_blank\">Allen Jones</a>, a past chair of the section, for helping him through the transition.</p><p>Pandy has been busy since taking office. The section formed a <a href=\"https://life.ieee.org/volunteers/life-members-affinity-groups/\" target=\"_blank\">life members affinity group</a> and has held events with the <a href=\"https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/vcu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Virginia Commonwealth University student branch</a> in Richmond. The section also held <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/leadership-skills-ieee-courses\" target=\"_blank\">career-development</a> events there, allowing IEEE members to mentor engineering students, provide them with networking tips, and help them refine their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://ieeemagnetics.org/home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Magnetics Society</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Computer Society</a> chapters partnered with VCU, <a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI Ready RVA</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ritsva.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Richmond Institute of Technology and Science</a> to increase<a href=\"https://aireadyrva.com/blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> artificial intelligence literacy for preuniversity students in underserved communities</a>. The initiative provides training to educators and offers workshops to students demonstrating the technology and its practical applications.</p><p>Through leading all those activities, Pandy says, he has picked up important skills including strategic planning, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5-tips-technical-presentations\" target=\"_blank\">public speaking</a>, team collaboration, and budget planning, which he can apply at work.</p><p>\u201cThese experiences have helped me drive large-scale IT transformation projects in my professional role,\u201d he says, \u201cand improved my ability to lead diverse and cross-functional teams.</p><p>\u201cVolunteering fuels my energy rather than drains it. Also, it\u2019s kind of a small, rewarding part of my weekly routine. I feel that I\u2019ve done a little bit to help someone somewhere move a step ahead in their career\u2014which gives me great satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Pandy hasn\u2019t lost his desire to be an entertainer. He performs whenever possible at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeZ2sFI74Do\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cultural events</a> and the section\u2019s social gatherings.</p><p>\u201cDancing and acting are now hobbies,\u201d he says.</p>"

The standard was a result of a <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">2022 memorandum</a> from the Biden administration that requires federal agencies to transition to PQC-based security by 2035.</p><p>Cryptography relies on math problems that are nearly impossible to solve, but easy to check if a solution is correct. Armed with such math problems, only the holder of a secret key can check their solution and get access to the secret data. Today, most online cryptography relies on one of two such algorithms: either <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rsa-token-replacement-a-slow-process\" target=\"_blank\">RSA</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography\" target=\"_blank\">elliptic-curve cryptography</a>.</p><p>The cause for concern is that quantum computers, if a large enough one is ever built, would make easy work of the \u201chard\u201d problems underlying current cryptographic methods. Luckily, there are other math problems that appear to be equally hard for quantum computers and their existing classical counterparts. That\u2019s the basis of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2667758178\" target=\"_blank\">post-quantum cryptography</a>: cryptography that\u2019s secure against hypothetical quantum computers.</p><p>With the mathematics behind PQC ironed out, and standards in hand, the work of adoption is now underway. This is no easy feat: every computer, laptop, smartphone, self-driving car, or IoT device will have to fundamentally change the way they run cryptography.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ali.elkaafarani\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ali El Kaafarani</a> is a research fellow at the Oxford Mathematical Institute who contributed to the development of NIST\u2019s PQC standards. He also founded a company, <a href=\"https://pqshield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PQShield</a>, to help bring post-quantum cryptography into the real world by assisting original equipment manufacturers in implementing the new protocols. He spoke with <em>IEEE Spectrum <strong></strong><strong></strong></em><span>about</span> how adoption is going and whether the new standards will be implemented in time to beat the looming threat of quantum computers.</p><p><strong>What has changed in the industry since the NIST PQC standards came out?</strong></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Portrait photograph of Ali El Kaafarani, dark haired man with a beard, a mustache and glasses\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"65f9b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-photograph-of-ali-el-kaafarani-dark-haired-man-with-a-beard-a-mustache-and-glasses.jpg?id=61455658&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Ali El Kaafarani</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">PQShield</small></p><p><strong>Ali El Kaafarani</strong><strong>:</strong> Before the standards came out, a lot of people were not talking about it at all, in the spirit of \u201cIf it\u2019s working, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d Once the standards were published, the whole story changed, because now it\u2019s not hypothetical quantum hype, it\u2019s a compliance issue. There are standards published by the U.S. government. There are deadlines for the adoption. And the 2035 [deadline] came together with the publication from [the National Security Agency] and was adopted in formal legislation that passed Congress, and therefore there is no way around it. Now it\u2019s a compliance issue.</p><p>Before, people used to ask us, \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer. But that\u2019s the issue, because we\u2019re talking about a risk that can materialize any time. Some other, more intelligent people who have access to a wider range of information decided in 2015 to categorize quantum computing as a real threat. So this year was a transformational year, because the question went from \u201cWhy do we need it?\u201d to \u201cHow are we going to use it?\u201d And the whole supply chain started looking into who\u2019s going to do what, from chip design to the network security layer, to the critical national infrastructure, to build up a post-quantum-enabled network security kit.</p><h2>Challenges in PQC Implementation</h2><p><strong>What are some of the difficulties of implementing the NIST standards?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> You have the beautiful math, you have the algorithms from NIST, but you also have the wild west of cybersecurity. That infrastructure goes from the smallest sensors and car keys, etc., to the largest server sitting there and trying to crunch hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, each with different security requirements, each with different energy consumption requirements. Now that is a different problem. That\u2019s not a mathematical problem, that\u2019s an implementation problem. This is where you need a company like PQShield, where we gather hardware engineers, and firmware engineers, and software engineers, and mathematicians, and everyone else around them to actually say, \u201cWhat can we do with this particular use case?\u201d</p><p>Cryptography is the backbone of cybersecurity infrastructure, and worse than that, it\u2019s the invisible piece that nobody cares about until it breaks. If it\u2019s working, nobody touches it. They only talk about it when there\u2019s a breach, and then they try to fix things. In the end, they usually put Band-Aids on it. That\u2019s normal, because enterprises can\u2019t sell the security feature to the customers. They were just using it when governments force them, like when there\u2019s a compliance issue. And now it\u2019s a much bigger problem, as someone is telling them, \u201cYou know what, all the cryptography that you\u2019ve been using for the past 15 years, 20 years, you need to change it, actually.\u201d</p><p><strong>Are there security concerns for the PQC algorithm implementations?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> Well, we haven\u2019t done it before. It hasn\u2019t been battle-tested. And now what we\u2019re saying is, \u201cHey, AMD and the rest of the hardware or semiconductor world, go and put all those new algorithms in hardware, and trust us, they\u2019re going to work fine, and then nobody\u2019s going to be able to hack them and extract the key.\u201d That\u2019s not easy, right? Nobody has the guts to say this.</p><p>That\u2019s why, at PQShield, we have vulnerability teams that are trying to break our own designs, separately from those teams who are designing things. You have to do this. You need to be one step ahead of attackers. That\u2019s all you need to do, and that\u2019s all you can do, because you can\u2019t say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got something that is secure. Nobody can break it.\u201d If you say that, you\u2019re going to eat a humble pie in 10 years\u2019 time, because maybe someone will come up with a way to break it. You need to just do this continuous innovation and continuous security testing for your products.</p><p>Because PQC is new, we still haven\u2019t seen all the creativity of attackers trying to bypass the beautiful mathematics and come up with those creative and nasty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\" target=\"_blank\">side-channel attacks</a> that just laugh at the mathematics. For example, some attacks look at the energy consumption the algorithm is taking on your laptop, and they extract the key from the differences in energy consumption. Or there are timing attacks that look at how long it takes for you to encrypt the same message 100 times and how that\u2019s changing, and they can actually extract the key. So there are different ways to attack algorithms there, and that\u2019s not new. We just don\u2019t have billions of these devices in our hands now that have post-quantum cryptography that people have tested.</p><h2>Progress in PQC Adoption</h2><p><strong>How would you say adoption has been going so far?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> The fact that a lot of companies only started when the standards were published, it puts us in a position where there are some that are well advanced in their thoughts and their processes and their adoption, and there are others that are totally new to it because they were not paying attention, and they were just kicking the can down the road. The majority of those who were kicking the can down the road are the ones that don\u2019t sit high up in the supply chain, because they felt like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s responsibility. But they didn\u2019t understand that they had to influence their suppliers when it comes to their requirements and timelines and integration and so many things that they have to prepare. This is what\u2019s going on now: A lot of them are doing a lot of work.</p><p>Now, those who sit high up in the supply chain, quite a few of them have made great progress and started embedding post-quantum cryptography designs into new products and are trying to work out a way to upgrade products that are already on the ground.</p><p>I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re in a great place, where everyone is doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing. That\u2019s not the case. But I think that from last year, when many people were asking \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to have a quantum computer?\u201d and are now asking \u201cHow can I be compliant? Where do you think I should start? And how can I evaluate where the infrastructure to understand where the most valuable assets are, and how can I protect them? What influence can I exercise on my suppliers?\u201d I think huge progress has been made.</p><p>Is it enough? It\u2019s never enough in security. Security is damn difficult. It\u2019s a multidisciplinary topic. There are two types of people: those who love to build security products, and those who would love to break them. We\u2019re trying to get most of those who love to break them onto the right side of history so that they can make products stronger rather than actually making existing ones vulnerable for exploitation.</p><p><strong>Do you think we\u2019re going to make it by 2035?</strong></p><p><strong>El Kaafarani:</strong> I think that the majority of our infrastructure should be post-quantum secure by 2035, and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s a good thought to have. Now, what happens if quantum computers happen to become reality before that? That\u2019s a good topic for a TV series or for a movie. What happens when most secrets are readable? People are not thinking hard enough about it. I don\u2019t think that anyone has an answer for that. <strong></strong></p>"

My first job after university was as a founding engineer (employee #3) at a Stanford startup. Onboarding at this company was as simple as \u201chere\u2019s your laptop, good luck!\u201d</span></p><p>This startup was acquired by <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a>, which was a Silicon Valley darling undergoing hypergrowth at the time with about 400 employees. Pinterest had more of a process than the startup, but the product and company were changing rapidly. The onboarding docs were frequently incorrect or outdated.</p><p>Then I joined Facebook (now <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a>) as a senior engineer, entering a Big Tech environment with tens of thousands of employees. Facebook is famous for a very structured approach to onboarding through Bootcamp, a multi-week program to get engineers up to speed.</p><p>On top of company transitions, I\u2019ve also had \u201cmini-onboardings\u201d within a company when switching teams or moving around due to a re-org. The tech industry today moves incredibly fast, so your ability to adapt and ramp up quickly is essential for <span>career</span> success.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed during the onboarding process because there\u2019s so much to learn: a new codebase, team dynamics, and company culture. Instead of relying on standard documentation and training sessions, I discovered a more proactive approach among the best-performing new employees. This strategy lets you quickly ramp up with confidence.</p><p><strong>The Algorithm for Intro 1:1s</strong></p><p><strong></strong><span>When you\u2019re new, don\u2019t wait for information to come to you. A great way to seek out information is by having one-on-one meetings with your new coworkers. Here\u2019s the \u201c</span><span>career</span><span> cold start algorithm\u201d I used for these conversations. (</span><a href=\"https://connect.ieee.org/NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGcgIWWbsgcAcGwQBDSaaGelp7H5do4pTyUfmYvMqdRv5NUoGehtfIJPXV7ofRv_LNwXiUuvIU=\" target=\"_blank\">This comes from a blog post from Meta\u2019s CTO</a><span>.)</span></p><p>During these one-on-ones, ask three key questions:</p><ul><li>\u201cWhat do I, as a new engineer, need to know?\u201d (25 min) This helps you gather critical, unfiltered information from one person\u2019s perspective.</li><li>\u201cWhat are the biggest challenges the team is facing?\u201d (3 min) This reveals the team\u2019s pain points and where you can potentially make a quick difference.</li><li>\u201cWho else on the team should I talk to?\u201d (2 min) This helps you set up subsequent 1:1s. By asking it repeatedly, you\u2019ll start to see a pattern as the same names come up frequently. These individuals are the trusted, influential people who are likely to be critical to your future projects.</li></ul><p>If you\u2019re joining a larger company, I recommend scheduling at least ten one-on-one conversations within your first two weeks. Take advantage of the fact that everyone wants to meet the new person! This list should include your direct manager, their manager, and every member of your immediate team.<br /></p><p><strong>Talk & Observe<br /></strong></p><p>Talking to colleagues is valuable, but actions speak louder than words. When you\u2019re new, observe how your teammates spend their time. This should be fairly easy because engineering work will naturally create byproducts that reveal priorities and goals.</p><p>If you\u2019re a software engineer, for example, look at the code or design documents a colleague has contributed to get a sense of the pace of the team and their priorities. What they document is a direct reflection of what they value.</p><p>Or, if possible, look at your teammates\u2019 schedules to see how they allocate their time. Are they in back-to-back meetings, or do they have significant blocks of focus time for deep work? This simple act provides a wealth of information about team norms and individual working styles.</p><p>This combination of talking and observing has immediate benefits. You can ask more thoughtful questions in meetings, identify opportunities in existing projects, and most importantly, <strong>onboard culturally</strong>. As you understand your new team\u2019s norms around meetings, code review, or product launches, you will quickly adapt to your new environment.</p><p>Implementing the \u201cTalk and Observe\u201d framework will make you confident and impactful in your new role.

Although qualified as a doctor, he chose to invent medical equipment instead. In 1949, while working at Elema-Schonander (later Siemens-Elema), in Stockholm, he applied for <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US2566443A/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a patent</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.medmuseum.siemens-healthineers.com/en/innovations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mingograph</a>, the first inkjet printer.

It could record physiological signals from a patient\u2019s electrocardiogram or electroencephalogram in real time, aiding doctors in diagnosing heart and brain conditions. Eight years later, he worked with cardiac surgeon <a href=\"https://www.hrsonline.org/about-hrs/history/40th-anniversary/ake-senning-md/\" target=\"_blank\">\u00c5ke Senning</a> to develop the first fully implantable pacemaker. So whether you\u2019re running documents through an inkjet printer or living your best life due to a pacemaker, give a nod of appreciation to the inventive Dr. Elmqvist.</p><h2>The world\u2019s first inkjet printer</h2><p>Rune Elmqvist was an inquisitive person. While still a student, he invented a specialized potentiometer to measure pH and a portable multichannel electrocardiograph. In 1940, he became head of development at the Swedish medical electronics company Elema-Schonander.</p><p>Before the Mingograph, electrocardiograph machines relied on a writing stylus to trace the waveform on a moving roll of paper. But friction between the stylus and the paper prevented small changes in the electrical signal from being accurately recorded. Elmqvist\u2019s initial design was a modified oscillograph. Traditionally, an oscillograph used a mirror to reflect a beam of light (converted from the electrical signal) onto photographic film or paper. Elmqvist swapped out the mirror for a small, moveable glass nozzle that continuously sprayed a thin stream of liquid onto a spool of paper. The electrical signal electrostatically controlled the jet.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a shirtless man reclining in a chair with straps around his chest and forearms that are wired to a rectangular piece of equipment on a cart.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a764f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-shirtless-man-reclining-in-a-chair-with-straps-around-his-chest-and-forearms-that-are-wired-to-a-rect.jpg?id=61517868&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Mingograph was originally used to record electrocardiograms of heart patients. It soon found use in many other fields.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens Healthineers Historical Institute</small></p><p>By eliminating the friction of a stylus, the Mingograph (which the company marketed as the Mingograf) was able to record more detailed changes of the heartbeat. The machine had three paper-feed speeds: 10, 25, and 50 millimeters per second. The speed could be preset or changed while in operation.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-inventions-that-made-heart-disease-less-deadly\" target=\"_self\">The Inventions That Made Heart Disease Less Deadly</a></p><p>An analog input jack on the Mingograph could be used to take measurements from other instruments. Researchers in disciplines far afield from medicine took advantage of this input to record pressure or sound. Phoneticians used it to examine the acoustic aspects of speech, and zoologists used it to record birdsongs. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, scientists cited the Mingograph in their research papers as an instrument for their experiments.</p><p>Today, the Mingograph isn\u2019t that widely known, but the underlying technology, inkjet printing, is ubiquitous. Inkjets dominate the home printer market, and specialized printers print DNA microarrays in labs for genomics research, create electrical traces for printed circuit boards, and much more, as Phillip W. Barth and Leslie A. Field describe in their 2024 <em><em>IEEE</em></em> <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> article \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/inkjet-printer\" target=\"_self\">Inkjets Are for More Than Just Printing</a>.\u201d</p><h2>The world\u2019s first implantable pacemaker</h2><p>Despite the influence of the Mingograph on the evolution of printing, it is arguably not Elmqvist\u2019s most important innovation. The Mingograph helped doctors diagnose heart conditions, but it couldn\u2019t save a patient\u2019s life by itself. One of Elmqvist\u2019s other inventions could and did: the first fully implantable, rechargeable pacemaker.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Image with a chest x-ray in the background and a pair of hands holding 2 implantable pacemakers. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f958c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image-with-a-chest-x-ray-in-the-background-and-a-pair-of-hands-holding-2-implantable-pacemakers.jpg?id=61517871&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The first implantable pacemaker [left] from 1958 had batteries that needed to be recharged once a week. The 1983 pacemaker [right] was programmable, and its batteries lasted several years.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Siemens Healthineers Historical Institute</small></p><p>Like many stories in the history of technology, this one was pushed into fruition at the urging of a woman, in this case Else-Marie Larsson. Else-Marie\u2019s 43-year-old husband, Arne, suffered from scarring of his heart tissue due to a viral infection. His heart beat so slowly that he constantly lost consciousness, a condition known as Stokes-Adams syndrome. Else-Marie refused to accept his death sentence and searched for an alternative. After reading a newspaper article about an experimental implantable pacemaker being developed by Elmqvist and Senning at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, she decided that her husband would be the perfect candidate to test it out, even though it had been tried only on animals up until that point.</p><p>External pacemakers\u2014that is, devices outside the body that regulated the heart beat by applying electricity\u2014already existed, but they were heavy, bulky, and uncomfortable. One early model plugged directly into a wall socket, so the user risked electric shock.</p><p>By comparison, Elmqvist\u2019s pacemaker was small enough to be implanted in the body and posed no shock risk. Fully encased in an epoxy resin, the disk-shaped device had a diameter of 55 mm and a thickness of 16 mm\u2014the dimensions of the Kiwi Shoe Polish tin in which Elmqvist molded the first prototypes. It used silicon transistors to pace a pulse with an amplitude of 2 volts and duration of 1.5 milliseconds, at a rate of 70 to 80 beats per minute (the average adult heart rate).</p><p>The pacemaker ran on two rechargeable 60-milliampere-hour nickel-cadmium batteries arranged in series. A silicon diode connected the batteries to a coil antenna. A 150-kilohertz radio loop antenna outside the body charged the batteries inductively through the skin. The charge lasted about a week, but it took 12 hours to recharge. Imagine having to stay put that long.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of three older white men in suits. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"adba6\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-three-older-white-men-in-suits.jpg?id=61517872&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">In 1958, over 30 years before this photo, Arne Larsson [right] received the first implantable pacemaker, developed by Rune Elmqvist [left] at Siemens-Elema. \u00c5ke Senning [center] performed the surgery.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sj\u00f6berg Bildbyr\u00e5/ullstein bild/Getty Images</small></p><p>Else-Marie\u2019s persuasion and persistence pushed Elmqvist and Senning to move from animal tests to human trials, with Arne as their first case study. During a secret operation on 8 October 1958, Senning placed the pacemaker in Arne\u2019s abdomen wall with two leads implanted in the myocardium, a layer of muscle in the wall of the heart. The device lasted only a few hours. But its replacement, which happened to be the only spare at the time, worked perfectly for six weeks and then off and on for several more years.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Photo of 5 implantable pacemakers. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f7e80\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-5-implantable-pacemakers.jpg?id=61517874&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Arne Larsson lived another 43 years after his first pacemaker was implanted. Shown here are five of the pacemakers he received. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Sj\u00f6berg Bildbyr\u00e5/ullstein bild/Getty Images</small></p><p>Arne Larsson clearly was happy with the improvement the pacemaker made to his quality of life because he endured 25 more operations over his lifetime to replace each failing pacemaker with a new, improved iteration. He managed to outlive both Elmqvist and Senning, finally <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/world/arne-h-w-larsson-86-had-first-internal-pacemaker.html\" target=\"_blank\">dying at the age of 86</a> on 28 December 2001. Thanks to the technological intervention of his numerous pacemakers, his heart never gave out. His cause of death was skin cancer.</p><p>Today, more than a million people worldwide have pacemakers implanted each year, and an implanted device can last up to 15 years before needing to be replaced. (Some pacemakers in the 1980s used nuclear batteries, which could last even longer, but the radioactive material was problematic. See \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival\" target=\"_self\">The Unlikely Revival of Nuclear Batteries</a>.\u201d) Additionally, some pacemakers also incorporate a defibrillator to shock the heart back to a normal rhythm when it gets too far out of sync. This lifesaving device certainly has come a long way from its humble start in a shoe polish tin.</p><h2>Rune Elmqvist\u2019s legacy</h2><p>Whenever I start researching the object of the month for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\">Past Forward</a>, I never know where the story will take me or how it might hit home. My dad lived with congestive heart failure for more than two decades and absolutely loved his pacemaker. He had a great relationship with his technician, Francois, and they worked together to fine-tune the device and maximize its benefits. And just like Arne Larsson, my dad died from an unrelated cause.</p><p>An engineer to the core, he would have delighted in learning about the history of this fantastic invention. And he probably would have been tickled by the fact that the same person also invented the inkjet printer. My dad was not a fan of inkjets, but I\u2019m sure he would have greatly admired Rune Elmqvist, who saw problems that needed solving and came up with elegantly engineered solutions.</p><p><em><em>Part of a </em></em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\"><em><em>continuing series</em></em></a><em> </em><em><em>looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></em></p><p><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the September 2025 print issue.</em></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>There is frustratingly little documented information about the Mingograph\u2019s origin story or functionality other than its <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US2566443A/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patent</a>.

But when it comes to managing the data centers that power this AI revolution, human operators are far more cautious.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/research-and-reports/uptime-institute-global-data-center-survey-results-2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new survey</a> of over 600 data center operators worldwide by <a href=\"https://uptimeinstitute.com/ui-intelligence\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uptime Institute</a>, a data center inspection and rating firm, only 14 percent say they would trust AI systems to change equipment configurations, even if it\u2019s trained on years of historical data. In the same survey, just 1 in 3 operators say they would trust AI systems to control data center equipment.</p><p>Their skepticism may be justified: Despite pouring tens of billions of US dollars into AI systems, 95 percent of organizations thus far lack a clear return on investment, according to a recent <a href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">MIT report</a><span> of generative AI usage. Advanced industries, which include factories and data centers, ranked near the bottom of the list of sectors transformed by AI, if at all.</span></p><h2>Operator Trust in AI Systems</h2><p>Even before the AI-driven push to expand data centers, data center operators themselves are known to be a relatively change-averse crowd who have been disappointed by buzzy technologies of the past, says <a href=\"https://uptimeinstitute.com/ui-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">Rose Weinschenk</a>, a research associate at Uptime Institute. Operators often have <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-jobs\" target=\"_self\">electrical engineering</a> or technical mechanical backgrounds, with training in the running of critical facilities; others work on the IT or network system side and are also considered operators.<strong></strong></p><p>Operator trust in AI declined every year for the three years following OpenAI\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatbot-chatgpt-interview\" target=\"_self\">release of ChatGPT in 2022</a>. When asked by Uptime if they trusted a trained AI system to run data center operations, 24 percent of respondents said no in 2022 and 42 percent said no in 2024. While the public has marveled at the seemingly all-knowing nature of new large language models, operators seem to feel this type of AI is too limited and unpredictable for use in data centers.</p><p>But now, operators appear to have entered a \u201cperiod of careful testing and validation\u201d of different types of AI systems in certain data center operations, said Uptime research analyst <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-smolaks/\" target=\"_blank\">Max Smolaks</a> in a public webinar of the latest survey results. To capture changing sentiments, Uptime asked operators in 2025 which applications AI might serve as a trustworthy decision-maker, assuming adequate past training. Over 70 percent of operators say they would trust AI to analyze sensor data or predict maintenance tasks for equipment, the survey shows.</p><p>\u201cData center operators are very, very happy to do certain things using AI, and they will never, never trust AI to do certain other things,\u201d Smolaks said in the webinar. </p><h2>AI\u2019s Unpredictability in Data Centers</h2><p>One reason why trust in AI is low for critical control of equipment is the technology\u2019s unpredictability. Data centers are run on \u201cgood, old-fashioned\u201d engineering, such as programmed if/then logic, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-wright-aa601738/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Wright</a>, the chief data center officer at <a href=\"https://ilkari.tech/en/services/\" target=\"_blank\">Ilkari Data Centers</a>, a data center startup company with two centers in Colombia and Iceland. \u201cWe say that we can\u2019t run on luck, we have to run on certainty.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/ai-data-centres/\" target=\"_blank\">Data centers</a> are a complex series of systems that feed into each other. Mere seconds can pass before catastrophic failures occur that result in damaged chips, wasted money, angry customers, or<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/egypt-telecommunications-fire-cairo-downtown-burns-3901df6df533dfa41d20605813d516f2\" target=\"_blank\"> fatal fires</a>. In the high-stakes environment of data centers, anonymous posters on the r/datacenter Reddit forum who replied to an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/datacenter/comments/1m0ujih/do_dcs_use_ai_to_operate_journalist_question/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> query</a> generally failed to see a reason to justify the risk that AI could bring.</p><p>Distrust may also mask an underlying job insecurity. Workers across many industries are concerned that AI will take their jobs. But the 2025 Uptime survey found that only one in five operators view AI as a way of reducing average staffing level.</p><p>\u201cOperators believe that today\u2019s AI is not going to replace the staff required to run their facilities,\u201d Smolaks said in the Uptime webinar. \u201cIt might be coming for office workers, but data center jobs appear to be safe from AI for now.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s understandable for early career operators to still <em><em>feel</em></em> like this technology is coming for their jobs, says electrical engineer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksonfahrney/\" target=\"_blank\">Jackson Fahrney</a>, who has worked in data centers for over eight years. Someone just six months on the job may view an AI system like being told, \u201cHere, train your replacement,\u201d he says. In reality, he does not think AI will replace himself or others inside data centers. Yet AI carries an more \u201cominous\u201d presence in the workplace than machine learning tools, which have long been part of an operator\u2019s toolkit and are meant to assist operators when making decisions.<span><strong></strong></span></p><p>It could be that AI is the cherry on top of an industry-wide trend to reduce the number of operators within data centers, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mclean/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris McLean</a>, a data center design and construction consultant.<strong></strong></p><p>Whereas 60 engineers might have run a data center in the past, now only six are needed, McLean says. Less is required from those six, as well, as more and more critical maintenance is being outsourced to specialists outside of the data center. \u201cNow you offset all of your risk with a low-cost human and a high-cost AI,\u201d McLean said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to imagine that that\u2019s scary for operators.\u201d</p><p>That said, there are more data center jobs than qualified applicants, as previously <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-jobs\" target=\"_self\">reported</a> by <em><em>Spectrum</em></em>. Two-thirds of operators struggle with staff retention or recruitment, according to Uptime\u2019s 2025 survey, similar to the responses from surveys for the previous two years.</p><h2>Efficient AI Algorithms for Data Centers</h2><p>Still, there are useful algorithms built on decades of machine learning research that could make data center operation more efficient. The most established AI system for data centers is predictive maintenance, says Ilkari\u2019s Wright. If the readings of a particular HVAC unit are rising faster than those from other units, for instance, the system can predict when that unit needs to be serviced.</p><p>Other AI systems focus on optimizing chiller plants, which are, in effect, the refrigerator systems that keep the data center cool by circulating chilled water and air. Chillers account for much of the energy consumed by data centers. Data about weather patterns, load on the grid, and equipment degradation over time all feed into a single AI system run on hardware within the facility to optimize the total energy consumption, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-berger-69b67b54/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Berger</a>, who runs research and development at the Australia-based energy software company <a href=\"https://www.conserveitiot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Conserve IT</a>.</p><p>But Berger is quick to note that his AI optimization software does not control equipment. It runs on top of the basic control loop and refines parameters to use less energy while achieving the same outcome, he says. <span>Berger prefers to call this system machine learning instead of AI because of how specialized it is to the needs of a data center.</span></p><p>Others fully embrace AI, both the name and the technology, like <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jominarik/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Minarik</a>, the chief operating officer at <a href=\"https://www.databank.com/data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\">DataBank</a>, a Dallas-based data center company with 73 data centers across the U.S. and United Kingdom. He attributes his admittedly bullish attitude towards AI to his 17 years working for Amazon Web Services, where software is king. Currently, DataBank uses AI to write software, and there are plans to roll out AI systems for automated ticket generation and monitoring, as well as network configuration monitoring and adjustments by the end of the year. AI for bigger tasks, such as cooling, are tentatively scheduled for late 2026, subject to the time it takes to train the AI on enough data, he said.</p><p>AI does hallucinate: Minarik has watched it give the wrong information and send his team down the wrong path. \u201cWe do, we see it happen today. But we also see it getting better and better once we give it more time,\u201d he says.</p><p>The key is \u201ctremendous amounts of data points\u201d in order for AI to understand the system, Minarik says. It\u2019s not unlike training a human data center engineer about every possible scenario that could happen within the halls of a data center. </p><p>Hyperscalers and enterprise data centers, whose single customer is the company that owns the data center, are deploying AI at a faster pace than commercial companies like DataBank. Minarik is hearing of AI systems that run entire networks for in-house data centers.</p><p>When DataBank rolls out AI for more significant data center operations, it will be kept on a tight leash, Minarik says. Operators will still make final executions. </p><p>While AI will undoubtedly change how data centers run, Minarik sees operators as a core part of that new future. Data centers are physical places with on-site activity. \u201cAI can\u2019t walk out there and change a spark plug,\u201d he says, or hear an odd rattle from a server rack. Although Minarik says that one day there could be sensors for some of these issues, they\u2019ll still need physical human techs to fix the equipment that keep data centers running.</p><p>\u201cIf you want a safe job that can protect you from AI,\u201d Minarik says, \u201cGo to data centers.\u201d</p>"
