        "summary": "U.S. laws make it illegal for employers to knowingly hire undocumented migrants. This legal constraint affects which firms will employ unauthorized workers and what jobs undocumented migrants can expect to get. As a result, unauthorized migrants are more likely to end up in jobs that have a lower risk of detection of immigration status and are less desirable. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which began in August 2012, gave temporary legal authorization to work in the U.S. to a subset of undocumented migrants \u2013 those who arrived in the U.S. as children meeting certain other eligibility criteria. In this paper, we use a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the effect of DACA on the occupational outcomes of young adults who arrived in the U.S. as children. Applying this strategy to individual-level data from the American Community Survey, we find that DACA eligibility decreases the likelihood that noncitizen childhood immigrants hold traditional immigrant jobs or jobs with a high risk of injury, and increases the likelihood of holding a government job or jobs that require occupational licensing. On the whole, DACA eligibility shifts noncitizen childhood immigrants to occupations that are higher-paying and employ more educated workers. These findings are consistent with legal barriers constraining undocumented childhood migrants from taking the jobs they are interested in and have the skills for. These workers are shunted to jobs they find less desirable and there are societal losses from the misallocation of talent."

        "summary": "Science has long been concentrated in the Western world, but the global research landscape is undergoing a profound reorganization. Using data on 44 million publications from 1980 to 2022, we document the geography of science in terms of who produces it, what it studies, and where it diffuses. The share of publications produced in the United States has fallen from 40% in 1980 to 15% in 2022, while China\u2019s share has risen from near-zero to 32%. This pattern extends even to elite outlets, with China now producing over 35% of top-journal publications. Notably, this is driven not only by an expanding researcher base but also\u2014to a large extent\u2014by increases in individual productivity. This growth varies by fields: China leads in the Engineering and Physical Sciences (such as Chemistry), while the US retains its lead in Biomedical and Health Sciences. Moreover, China\u2019s expanding leadership in scientific production has not translated into a commensurate shift in global diffusion and integration. Elite research remains disproportionately focused on US topics (40% of breakthrough publications), and citations to Chinese research disproportionately come from within China rather than from other regions, even for top-tier science. Similar to China, other middle- and low-income countries (including India, Russia, and Brazil) have also expanded output producing as much research as high-income European Union countries combined (about 21% overall) but they remain underrepresented in top-tier journals. Overall, our findings highlight both the democratization and fragmentation of global science, raising important questions about the future of the global scientific enterprise."

        "summary": "This paper presents the first direct test of two interlinked predictions at the core of the monopsony theory of the labor market: (i) that firms exploit wage-setting power by marking down wages below the marginal revenue product of labor, and (ii) that exogenous wage constraints, if binding, eliminate markdowns. Our research design revisits the 2015 introduction of a high minimum wage in Germany. Drawing on a monopsony model, we derive an empirically tractable difference-in-differences specification that provides a quantitative benchmark for the firm-level markdown response. Our main result is that empirical markdowns respond only 0\u201325% as much as the monopsony model would have predicted. Hence, at least for the labor market segment we study, (i) markdowns largely reflect other distortions than monopsony, (ii) markdowns are mismeasured, (iii) minimum wages induce widespread labor shortages, or (iv) the standard monopsony model does not provide a full, realistic account of the labor market."

        "summary": "This paper quantifies aggregate productivity in general equilibrium economies where agents with heterogeneous preferences make discrete choices between locations and occupations. We show how the conventional tools of welfare economics, like cost-benefit analysis, can be extended to these settings. Following Debreu (1951), we measure the change in aggregate productivity as the maximum reduction in total factor productivity such that it is possible to make every household at least indifferent to their status quo allocation. Aggregate productivity rises if primary factors can be saved while keeping every household at least indifferent. We characterize this measure of efficiency in terms of compensated supply and demand curves. We show that, to a first-order approximation, the elasticity of aggregate productivity to productivity shocks is given by sales shares (regardless of preferences and technologies). We also provide second-order approximations in terms of elasticities of uncompensated supply and demand curves. We contrast our approach with some popular alternative measures of aggregate efficiency and welfare: real GDP, the cross-sectional average of utilities, and the sum of compensating variations, and show that these alternative measures have serious flaws."

        "summary": "We study the labor market effects of tenure-dependent severance pay systems that tie firing costs to workers\u2019 accumulated earnings histories. We develop an overlapping-generations search-and-matching model in which firms face increasing separation costs over the employment relationship. Using administrative employer\u2013employee data from Brazil, we estimate the model and show that tenure-dependent severance costs induce labor hoarding among low-productivity, long-tenured workers who would not be hired if unemployed. These distortions are strongest late in the life cycle, when firms optimally delay separation to avoid severance obligations, while simultaneously imposing higher hiring thresholds on older unemployed workers with shorter continuation values. These forces imply that tenure-based severance policies protect employment histories rather than productivity, shaping labor market dynamics over the life cycle and generating allocative inefficiencies."

Using a regression discontinuity approach, we compare students whose placement exam scores are just above and just below the elite admission threshold. We find that five and ten years after the admission exam, marginally admitted students are less likely to be employed in the formal private sector, and, if employed, they earn lower wages. However, these employment and wage gaps close after 15 years. Moreover, we find that marginal admission to elite high schools leads to delayed entry into the formal labor market, and, at least in the short run, students in elite high schools seem to sort into lower-productivity firms and industries."

My favorite question to answer is, \u2018Can you make this better or easier?\u2019\u201d</p><p>For her work, the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.pwc-ny.org/about-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Women in Construction</a> named her one of its <a href=\"https://members.pwc-ny.org/events/Details/holiday-party-2025-1496059?sourceTypeId=Hub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 Under 40: Women in Construction</a> for 2025.</p><p>Kizildemir is passionate about <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-collabratec-mentoring-program\" target=\"_blank\">mentoring young engineers</a> and being an IEEE volunteer. She says she has made it her mission to \u201cpack as much impact into my years as possible.\u201d</p><h2>A bright student in T\u00fcrkiye</h2><p>She was born in Istanbul to a father who is a professional drummer and a mother who worked in magazine advertising and sales. Kizildemir and her older brother pursued engineering careers despite neither parent being involved in the field. While she became an expert in civil and mechanical engineering, her brother is an industrial engineer.</p><p>As a child, she was full of curiosity, she says, interested in figuring out how things were built and how they worked. She loved building objects out of <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Legos</a>, she says, and one of her earliest memories is using them to make miniature houses for ants.</p><p>After acing an entrance exam, she won a spot in a STEM-focused high school, where she studied mathematics and physics.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>\u201cEngineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.\u201d</span></p><p><span></span>During her final year at the high school, she took the nationwide <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Selection_and_Placement_System\" target=\"_blank\">YKS</a> (Higher Education Foundations Examination). The test determines which universities and programs\u2014such as medicine, engineering, or law\u2014students can pursue.</p><p>She received a full scholarship to attend <a href=\"https://www.isikun.edu.tr/en\" target=\"_blank\">I\u015fik University</a> in \u015eile. Figuring she would study engineering abroad one day, she chose an English-taught program. She says she found that civil engineering best aligned with making the biggest impact on her community and the world.</p><p>Several of her professors were alumni of <a href=\"https://www2.lehigh.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Lehigh University</a>, in Bethlehem, Pa., and spoke highly of the school. After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering in 2016, she decided to attend Lehigh, where she earned a full scholarship to its master\u2019s program in civil engineering.</p><h2>Moving abroad and working the rails</h2><p>Her master\u2019s thesis focused on investigating root causes of crack propagation, which threatens railroad safety.</p><p>Repeated wheel-rail loading causes microcracks, leading to metal fatigue, and residual stress results from specialized heating and cooling treatments during the manufacturing of steel rails. Cracks can develop beneath the rail\u2019s surface. Because they\u2019re invisible to the naked eye, such fractures are challenging to detect, Kizildemir says.</p><p>The project was done in collaboration with the U.S. <a href=\"https://railroads.dot.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Railroad Administration</a>\u2014part of the <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Transportation</a>\u2014which is looking to adjust technical standards and employ mitigation strategies.</p><p>Kizildemir and five colleagues designed and implemented testing protocols and physics-based simulations to detect cracks earlier and prevent their spread. Their research has given the Railroad Administration insights into structural defects that are being used to revise rail-building guidelines and inspection protocols. The administration published the <a href=\"https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/76534\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first phase</a> of the research in 2024.</p><p>After graduating in 2018, Kizildemir began a summer internship as a civil engineer at Thornton Tomasetti. She conducted computational modeling using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abaqus</a> software for rails subjected to repeated plastic deformation\u2014material that permanently changes shape when under excessive stress\u2014and presented her recommendations for improvement to the company\u2019s management.</p><p>During her internship, she worked with professors in different fields, including materials behavior and mechanical engineering. The experience, she says, inspired her to pursue a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh, continuing her research with the Railroad Administration. She earned her degree in 2023.</p><p>She loved the work and the team at Thornton Tomasetti so much, she says, that she applied to work at the company, where she is now a project engineer.</p><h2>From simulations to real-world applications</h2><p>Her work focuses on developing finite element models for critical infrastructure and extreme events.</p><p>Finite modeling breaks complex systems or topics into small elements connected together to numerically simulate real-world situations. She creates computational models of structures enduring realistic catastrophic events, such as a vehicle crashing into a building.</p><p>She uses simulations to understand how buildings react to attacks such as the one on 9/11, which, she says, is often used as an example of why such research is essential.</p><p>When starting a project, she and her team review building standards and try to identify new issues not yet covered by them. The team then adapts existing codes and standards, usually developed for well-understood hazards such as earthquakes, wind, and floods, to define simulation parameters.</p><p>When a new structure is being built, for example, it is not designed to withstand a truck crashing into it. But Kizildemir and her team want to know how the building would react should that happen. They simulate the environments and situations, and they make recommendations based on the results to reduce or eliminate risks of structural failure.</p><p>Mitigation suggestions include specific strategies to be implemented during project design and construction.</p><p>Simulations can be created for any infrastructure, Kizildemir says.</p><p>\u201cI love problems that force me to think differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to keep growing.\u201d</p><p>She says she plans to live by Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s internal motto: \u201cWhen others say no, we say \u2018Here\u2019s how.\u2019\u201d</p><h2>Joining IEEE and getting more involved</h2><p>When Kizildemir first heard of IEEE, she assumed it was only for electrical engineers. But after learning how diverse and inclusive the organization is, she joined in 2024. She has since been elevated to a senior member and has become a volunteer. She joined the <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMTEM014\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society</a>.</p><p>She chaired the conference tracks and IEEE-sponsored sessions at the 2024 <a href=\"https://event.asme.org/Joint-Rail-Conference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Rail Conference</a>, held in Columbia, S.C. She actively contributes to IEEE\u2019s <a href=\"https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Collabratec platform</a> and has participated in panel review meetings for senior member elevation applications.</p><p>She\u2019s also a member of <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASME</a> and has been volunteering for it since 2023.</p><p>\u201cCommunity is what helped get me to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward and make the field better,\u201d she says. \u201cHelping others improves ourselves.\u201d</p><h2>Looking ahead and giving back</h2><p>Kizildemir mentors junior engineers at Thornton Thomasetti and is looking to expand her reach through <a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/membership/mentoring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE\u2019s mentorship programs</a>.</p><p>\u201cEngineering doesn\u2019t have a gender requirement,\u201d she says she tells girls. \u201cIf you\u2019re curious and like understanding how things work and get excited to solve difficult problems, engineering is for you.</p><p>\u201cCivil engineers don\u2019t just build bridges,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere are countless niche areas to be explored. Engineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.\u201d</p><p>Kizildemir says she wants every engineer to be able to improve their community. Her main piece of advice for recent engineering graduates is that \u201ccuriosity, discipline, and the willingness to understand things deeply, to see how things can be done better,\u201d are the keys to success.</p>"

Their current answer: 5.5 days. </p><p>The CRASH Clock metric was introduced in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09643\" target=\"_blank\">paper originally published on the Arxiv physics preprint server</a> in December and is currently under consideration for publication. The team\u2019s research measures how quickly a catastrophic collision could occur if satellite operators lost the ability to maneuver\u2014whether due to a solar storm, a software failure, or some other catastrophic failure.</p><p>To be clear, say the CRASH Clock scientists, low Earth orbit is not about to become a new unstable realm of collisions. But what the researchers have shown, consistent with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/kessler-syndrome-space-debris\" target=\"_blank\">recent research and public outcry</a>, is that low Earth orbit\u2019s current stability demands perfect decisions on the part of a range of satellite operators around the globe every day. A few mistakes at the wrong time and place in orbit could set a lot of chaos in motion.</p><p>But the biggest hidden threat isn\u2019t always debris that can be seen from the ground or via radar imaging systems. <span>Rather, thousands of small pieces of junk that are still big enough to disrupt a satellite\u2019s operations are what satellite operators have nightmares about these days</span><span>. Making matters worse is SpaceX essentially locking up one of the most valuable altitudes with their <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-cellphone-starlink\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink</a> satellite megaconstellation, forcing <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/23/2025/chinese-and-starlink-satellites-nearly-collide-in-space\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese competitors to fly higher through clouds of old collision debris</a> left over from earlier accidents.</span></p><p><span><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> spoke with astrophysicists <a href=\"https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/sarah-thiele\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Thiele</a> (graduate student at <a href=\"https://web.astro.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Princeton University</a>), <a href=\"https://phas.ubc.ca/users/aaron-boley\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Boley</a> (professor of physics and astronomy at the <a href=\"https://phas.ubc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">University of British Columbia</a>, in Vancouver, Canada), and <a href=\"https://campioncollege.ca/resources/dr-samantha-lawler/\" target=\"_blank\">Samantha Lawler</a> (associate professor of astronomy at the <a href=\"https://www.uregina.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Regina</a>, in Saskatchewan, Canada) about their new paper, and about how close satellites actually are to one another, why you can\u2019t see most space junk, and what happens to the power grid when everything in orbit fails at once.</span></p><p><strong>Does the CRASH Clock measure Kessler syndrome, or something different?</strong></p><p><strong>Sarah Thiele:</strong> A lot of people are claiming we\u2019re saying Kessler syndrome is days away, and that\u2019s not what our work is saying. We\u2019re not making any claim about this being a runaway collisional cascade. We only look at the timescale to the first collision\u2014we don\u2019t simulate secondary or tertiary collisions. The CRASH Clock reflects how reliant we are on errorless operations and is an indicator for stress on the orbital environment.</p><p><strong>Aaron Boley:</strong> A lot of people\u2019s mental vision of Kessler syndrome is this very rapid runaway, and in reality this is something that can take decades to truly build.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> <a href=\"https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/sdc9/paper/305/SDC9-paper305.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recent papers</a> found that altitudes between 520 and 1,000 kilometers have already reached this potential runaway threshold. Even in that case, the timescales for how slowly this happens are very long. It\u2019s more about whether you have a significant number of objects at a given altitude such that controlling the proliferation of debris becomes difficult.</p><h2>Understanding the CRASH Clock\u2019s Implications</h2><p><strong>What does the CRASH Clock approaching zero actually mean?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> The CRASH Clock assumes no maneuvers can happen\u2014a worst-case scenario where some catastrophic event like a solar storm has occurred. A zero value would mean if you lose maneuvering capabilities, you\u2019re likely to have a collision right away. It\u2019s possible to reach saturation where any maneuver triggers another maneuver, and you have this endless swarm of maneuvers where dodging doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.</p><p><strong>Boley:</strong> I think about the CRASH Clock as an evaluation of stress on orbit. As you approach zero, there\u2019s very little tolerance for error. If you have an accidental explosion\u2014whether a battery exploded or debris slammed into a satellite\u2014the risk of knock-on effects is amplified. It doesn\u2019t mean a runaway, but you can have consequences that are still operationally bad. It means much higher costs\u2014both economic and environmental\u2014because companies have to replace satellites more often. Greater launches, more satellites going up and coming down. The orbital congestion, the atmospheric pollution, all of that gets amplified.</p><p><strong>Are working satellites becoming a bigger danger to each other than debris?</strong></p><p><strong>Boley:</strong> The biggest risk on orbit is the lethal non-trackable debris\u2014this middle region where you can\u2019t track it, it won\u2019t cause an explosion, but it can disable the spacecraft if hit. This population is very large compared with what we actually track. We often talk about Kessler syndrome in terms of number density, but really what\u2019s also important is the collisional area on orbit. As you increase the area through the number of active satellites, you increase the probability of interacting with smaller debris.</p><p><strong>Samantha Lawler:</strong> <a href=\"https://starlink.com/public-files/starlinkProgressReport_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Starlink just released a conjunction report</a>\u2014they\u2019re doing one collision avoidance maneuver every two minutes on average in their megaconstellation. </p><p><strong>The orbit at 550 km altitude, in particular, is densely packed with Starlink satellites. Is that right?</strong></p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> The way Starlink has occupied 550 km and filled it to very high density means anybody who wants to use a higher-altitude orbit has to get through that really dense shell. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-internet\" target=\"_blank\">China\u2019s megaconstellations</a> are all at higher altitudes, so they have to go through Starlink. A couple of weeks ago, there was a <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/satellites/spacecraft-from-chinese-launch-nearly-slammed-into-starlink-satellite-spacex-says\" target=\"_blank\">headline</a> about a Starlink satellite almost hitting a Chinese rocket. These problems are happening now. Starlink <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/starlink-plans-lower-satellite-orbit-enhance-safety-2026-2026-01-01/\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a> they\u2019re moving down to 350 km, shifting satellites to even lower orbits. Really, everybody has to go through them\u2014including ISS, including astronauts.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> 550 km has the highest density of active payloads. There are other orbits of concern around 800 km\u2014the altitude of the [2007] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese anti-satellite missile test</a> and the [2009] <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20100002023\" target=\"_blank\">Cosmos-Iridium collision</a>. Above 600 km, atmospheric drag takes a very long time to bring objects down. Below 600 km, drag acts as a natural cleaning mechanism. In that 800 km to 900 km band, there\u2019s a lot of debris that\u2019s going to be there for centuries.</p><h2>Impact of Collisions at 550 Kilometers</h2><p><strong>What happens if there\u2019s a collision at 550 km? Would that orbit become unusable?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> No, it would not become unusable\u2014not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(2013_film)#Technical_observations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gravity</em> movie scenario</a>. Any catastrophic collision is an acute injection of debris. You would still be able to use that altitude, but your operating conditions change. You\u2019re going to do a lot more collision-avoidance maneuvers. Because it\u2019s below 600 km, that debris will come down within a handful of years. But in the meantime, you\u2019re dealing with a lot more danger, especially because that\u2019s the altitude with the highest density of Starlink satellites.</p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> I don\u2019t know how quickly Starlink can respond to new debris injections. It takes days or weeks for debris to be tracked, cataloged, and made public. I hope Starlink has access to faster services, because in the meantime that\u2019s an awful lot of risk.</p><p><strong>How do solar storms affect orbital safety?</strong></p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> Solar storms make the atmosphere puff up\u2014high-energy particles smashing into the atmosphere. Drag can change very quickly. During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms\" target=\"_blank\">May 2024 solar storm</a>, orbital uncertainties were kilometers. With things traveling 7 kilometers per second, that\u2019s terrifying. Everything is maneuvering at the same time, which adds uncertainty. You want to have margin for error, time to recover after an event that changes many orbits. <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-noaa-sun-reaches-maximum-phase-in-11-year-solar-cycle/\" target=\"_blank\">We\u2019ve come off solar maximum</a>, but over the next couple of years it\u2019s very likely we\u2019ll have more really powerful solar storms.</p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> The risk for collision within the first few days of a solar storm is a lot higher than under normal operating conditions. Even if you can still communicate with your satellite, there\u2019s so much uncertainty in your positions when everything is moving because of atmospheric drag. When you have high density of objects, it makes the likelihood of collision a lot more prominent.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Graph: collision chance vs. days.

Can you explain the revision?</strong></p><p><strong>Thiele:</strong> We updated based on community feedback, which was excellent. The newer numbers are 164 days for 2018 and 5.5 days for 2025. The paper is submitted and will hopefully go through peer review.</p><p><strong>Lawler:</strong> It\u2019s been a very interesting process putting this on Arxiv and receiving community feedback.

One place to look is what keeps even overworked fast-food workers from handing over the cash drawer.</span></p><h2>Human Judgment Depends on Context</h2><p><span>Our basic human defenses come in at least three types: general instincts, social learning, and situation-specific training. These work together in a layered defense.</span></p><p><span>As a social species, we have developed numerous instinctive and cultural habits that help us judge tone, motive, and risk from extremely limited information. We generally know what\u2019s normal and abnormal, when to cooperate and when to resist, and whether to take action individually or to involve others. These instincts give us an intuitive sense of risk and make us </span><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08242\" target=\"_blank\"><span>especially careful</span></a> about things that have a large downside or are impossible to reverse.</p><p><span>The second layer of defense consists of the norms and trust signals that evolve in any group. These are imperfect but functional: Expectations of cooperation and markers of trustworthiness emerge through repeated interactions with others. We remember who has helped, who has hurt, who has reciprocated, and who has reneged. And emotions like sympathy, anger, guilt, and gratitude motivate each of us to </span><a href=\"https://ncase.me/trust/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>reward cooperation with cooperation</span></a> and punish defection with defection.</p><p><span>A third layer is institutional mechanisms that enable us to interact with multiple strangers every day. Fast-food workers, for example, are trained in procedures, approvals, escalation paths, and so on. </span><span>Taken together, these defenses</span><span> give</span><span> humans a </span><span>strong sense</span><span> of context. A fast-</span><span>food worker basically knows what to expect within the</span><span> job</span><span> and</span><span> how it fits into broader society.</span></p><p><span>We reason by assessing multiple layers of context: perceptual (what we see and hear), relational (who\u2019s making the request), and normative (what\u2019s appropriate within a given role or situation). We constantly navigate these layers, weighing them against each other. In some cases, the normative outweighs the perceptual\u2014for example, following workplace rules even when customers appear angry. Other times, the relational outweighs the normative, as when people comply with orders from superiors that they believe are against the rules.</span></p><p><span>Crucially, we also have an interruption reflex. If something feels \u201coff,\u201d we naturally pause the automation and reevaluate. </span><span>Our defenses are not perfect; people are fooled and manipulated all the time. But it\u2019s how we humans are able to navigate a complex world where others are constantly trying to trick us.</span></p><p><span>So let</span><span>\u2019</span><span>s return to the drive-through window. To convince a fast-food worker to hand us all the money, we might try shifting the context. Show up with a camera crew and tell them you</span><span>\u2019</span><span>re filming a commercial, claim to be the head of security doing an audit, or dress like a bank manager collecting the cash receipts for the night. But even these have only a slim chance of success. Most of us, most of the time, can smell a scam.</span></p><p><span>Con artists are astute observers of human defenses. </span><span>Successful scams</span> are often slow, undermining a mark\u2019s situational assessment, allowing the scammer to manipulate the context. This is an old story, spanning traditional <span>confidence</span> <span>games such as the</span><span> </span>Depression-era \u201cbig store\u201d cons, in which teams of scammers created entirely fake businesses to draw in victims, and modern <a href=\"https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cpig-butchering\u201d frauds</a>, where online scammers slowly build trust before going in for the kill. In these examples, scammers slowly and methodically reel in a victim using a long series of interactions through which the scammers gradually gain that victim\u2019s trust.</p><p><span>Sometimes it even works at the drive-through. One scammer in the 1990s and 2000s </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_search_phone_call_scam\" target=\"_blank\">targeted fast-food workers by phone</a>, claiming to be a police officer and, over the course of a long phone call, convinced managers to strip-search employees and perform other bizarre acts.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Pixel art of a fast-food restaurant with a drive-thru, burger, cup, and trees.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1134a\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/pixel-art-of-a-fast-food-restaurant-with-a-drive-thru-burger-cup-and-trees.png?id=62858711&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Humans detect scams and tricks by assessing multiple layers of context. AI systems do not. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nicholas Little</small></p><h2>Why LLMs Struggle With Context and Judgment </h2><p><span>LLMs behave as if they have a notion of context, but it\u2019s different. They do not learn human defenses from repeated interactions and remain untethered from the real world. LLMs flatten multiple levels of context into text similarity. They see \u201ctokens,\u201d not hierarchies and intentions. LLMs don\u2019t reason through context, they only reference it.</span></p><p><span>While LLMs often get the details right, they can easily miss the big picture. If you prompt a chatbot with a fast-food worker scenario and ask if it should give all of its money to a customer, it will respond \u201cno.\u201d What it doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d\u2014forgive the anthropomorphizing\u2014is whether it\u2019s actually being deployed as a fast-food bot or is just a test subject following instructions for hypothetical scenarios.</span></p><p><span>This limitation is why LLMs misfire when context is sparse but also when context is overwhelming and complex; when an LLM becomes unmoored from context, it\u2019s hard to get it back. AI expert Simon Willison </span><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/12/claude-memory/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>wipes context clean</span></a> if an LLM is on the wrong track rather than continuing the conversation and trying to correct the situation.</p><p><span>There\u2019s more. LLMs are </span><a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2025/july/trent-cash-ai-overconfidence.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>overconfident</span></a> because they\u2019ve been designed to give an answer rather than express ignorance. A drive-through worker might say: <span>\u201c</span><span>I don\u2019t know if I should give you all the money\u2014let me ask my boss,\u201d whereas an LLM will just make the call. And since LLMs are designed to be </span><a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/large-language-models-just-want-to-be-liked\" target=\"_blank\"><span>pleasing</span></a><span>, they\u2019re more likely to satisfy a user\u2019s request.</span> Additionally, LLM training is oriented toward the average case and not extreme outliers, which is what\u2019s necessary for security.</p><p><span>The result is that the current generation of LLMs is far more gullible than people. They\u2019re naive and regularly fall for manipulative </span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/these-psychological-tricks-can-get-llms-to-respond-to-forbidden-prompts/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>cognitive tricks</span></a> that wouldn\u2019t fool a third-grader, such as flattery, appeals to groupthink, and a false sense of urgency. There<span>\u2019</span><span>s a </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk2p55g8o\" target=\"_blank\"><span>story</span></a> about a Taco Bell AI system that crashed when a customer ordered 18,000 cups of water. A human fast-food worker would just laugh at the customer.</p><h2>The Limits of AI Agents</h2><p><span>Prompt injection is an unsolvable problem that </span><a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/5555/01/11194053/2aB2Rf5nZ0k\" target=\"_blank\"><span>gets worse</span></a> when we give AIs tools and tell them to act independently. This is the promise of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\" target=\"_blank\">AI agents</a>: LLMs that can use tools to perform multistep tasks after being given general instructions. Their flattening of context and identity, along with their baked-in independence and overconfidence, mean that they will repeatedly and unpredictably take actions\u2014and sometimes they will take the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/ai_browsers_prompt_injection/\" target=\"_blank\"> wrong ones</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Science doesn\u2019t know how much of the problem is inherent to the way LLMs work and how much is a result of deficiencies in the way we train them. The overconfidence and obsequiousness of LLMs are training choices. The lack of an interruption reflex is a deficiency in engineering. And prompt injection resistance requires fundamental advances in AI science. We honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to build an LLM, where trusted commands and untrusted inputs are processed through the </span><a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/llms-data-control-path-insecurity/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>same channel</span></a><span>, which is immune to prompt injection attacks.</span></p><p><span>We humans get our model of the world\u2014and our facility with overlapping contexts\u2014from the way our brains work, years of training, an enormous amount of perceptual input, and millions of years of evolution. Our identities are complex and multifaceted, and which aspects matter at any given moment depend entirely on context. A fast-food worker may normally see someone as a customer, but in</span><span> a medical emergency, that same person\u2019s </span><span>identity as a doctor is suddenly more relevant. </span></p><p><span><span>We don</span><span>\u2019t know if LLMs will gain a better ability to move between different contexts as the models get more sophisticated. But t</span>he problem of recognizing context definitely can\u2019t be reduced to the one type of reasoning that LLMs currently excel at. Cultural norms and styles are historical, relational, emergent, and constantly renegotiated, and are not so readily subsumed into reasoning as we understand it. Knowledge itself can be both logical and discursive.</span></p><p><span>The AI researcher Yann LeCunn believes that improvements will come from embedding AIs in a physical presence and </span><span>giving</span> <span>them</span> \u201c<a href=\"https://medium.com/@AnthonyLaneau/beyond-llms-charting-the-next-frontiers-of-ai-with-yann-lecun-09e84f1978f9\" target=\"_blank\"><span>world models</span></a>.<span>\u201d Perhaps this is a way to give an AI a robust yet fluid notion of a social identity, and the real-world experience that will help it lose its na\u00efvet\u00e9.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately we are probably faced with a </span><a href=\"https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp/5555/01/11194053/2aB2Rf5nZ0k\" target=\"_blank\"><span>security trilemma</span></a> when it comes to AI agents: fast, smart, and secure are the desired attributes, but you can only get two. At the drive-through, you want to prioritize fast and secure. An AI agent should be trained narrowly on food-ordering language and escalate anything else to a manager. Otherwise, every action becomes a coin flip. Even if it comes up heads most of the time, once in a while it<span>\u2019</span><span>s going to be tails\u2014and along with a burger and fries, the customer will get the contents of the cash drawer.</span></p>"

It began on an overcrowded fishing boat in 1979 when he was fleeing Vietnam after the war, when survival as one of the country\u2019s \u201cboat people\u201d depended on endurance, luck, and the fragile reliability of a vessel never meant to carry so many lives. Like thousands of others, he fled from his war-torn country after the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Fall-of-Saigon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fall of Saigon</a>, which was controlled by communist North Vietnamese forces.</p><p>To mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon in 1975, Pham and his son Hoang Jr.\u2014a Rutgers computer science graduate turned filmmaker\u2014produced <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rSqNQqxkU-o?si=e3F8yW28hLfQV-a0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Unstoppable Hope</em></em></a>, a documentary about Vietnam\u2019s boat people. The film tells the stories of a dozen refugees who, like Pham, survived perilous escapes and went on to build successful lives in the United States.</p><h2>Growing up during the Vietnam War</h2><p>Pham was born in <a href=\"https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/binh-thuan-much-more-white-sand-golden-sunshine-and-blue-sea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn</a><strong>,</strong> Vietnam. His parents had only a little formal education, having grown up in the 1930s, when schooling was rare. To support their eight children, his parents ran a factory making bricks by hand. Despite their limited means, his parents held an unshakable belief that education was the surest path to a better life.</p><p>From an early age, Pham gravitated toward mathematics. Computers were scarce, but numbers and logic came naturally to him. He imagined becoming a teacher or professor and gradually began thinking about how mathematics could be applied to practical problems\u2014how abstract reasoning might improve daily life.</p><p>His intellectual curiosity unfolded amid frequent danger. He grew up during the Vietnam War, when dodging gunfire in his province was routine. The<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/tet-offensive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 1968 Tet Offensive</a> exposed the full scale of the conflict, making it clear that violence was not an interruption to life but a condition of it.</p><p>Pham recalls that after the<a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/april-30/south-vietnam-surrenders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Communist takeover of South Vietnam</a> in 1975, conditions worsened dramatically. Families without ties to the new government, especially those who operated small businesses, found it increasingly dangerous to work, study, or apply for jobs, he says. People began vanishing. Many attempted to escape by boat, knowing the risks: imprisonment if caught or potentially death at sea.</p><h2>A successful escape</h2><p>In June 1979, at the height of Vietnam\u2019s typhoon season, Pham\u2019s mother made an agonizing decision. She placed Pham, then 18 years old, onto a small, overcrowded fishing vessel in the hope that he might reach freedom.</p><p>The boat, which was designed to carry about 100 people, departed with 275.</p><p>Pham\u2019s 12-day journey was harrowing. He was confined to the lower deck, which was packed so tightly that movement was nearly impossible. Seasickness overwhelmed many passengers, and he remembers losing consciousness shortly after departure. Food was scarce, and safe drinking water was nearly nonexistent. Violent storms battered the vessel, and pirates loomed.</p><p>\u201cEvery moment felt like a struggle against nature, fate, and internal despair,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>The boat eventually washed ashore on a remote island off the Malaysian coast. Arriving at a refugee camp offered little relief; food and clean water were scarce, disease spread rapidly, and nearly everyone\u2014including Pham\u2014contracted malaria. Death came almost nightly.</p><p>After two weeks, Malaysian authorities transferred the refugees to a transit camp, where the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a> provided basic rations. Still, the asylum seekers\u2019 futures remained uncertain. It is estimated by the U.N. <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/about-unhcr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Refugee Agency</a> that between 1975 and the early 1990s, roughly 800,000 Vietnamese people attempted to escape by boat. As many as 250,000 did not survive the harrowing journey, the agency estimates.</p><h2>Starting over with nothing</h2><p>In January 1980, at age 19, Pham learned that someone in the United States had agreed to sponsor him for entry, he says. He soon boarded an airplane for the first time and landed in Seattle.</p><p>His troubles weren\u2019t over, however. He arrived in a city blanketed by snow, wearing thin clothing and carrying only a spare shirt. The frosty weather was not his greatest concern, though. During his first two months, he spent most of his time in a hospital, recovering from malaria and other diseases. And he spoke no English.</p><p>Still, Pham\u2014who had been a first-year college student in Vietnam\u2014refused to abandon his goal of becoming a teacher, he says. He enrolled at<a href=\"https://lincolnhs.seattleschools.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Lincoln High School</a> in order to gain English proficiency and position himself to enter an American college. One teacher allowed him to test into a calculus class despite his limited English\u2014which he passed.</p><p>\u201cThat moment told me I could survive here,\u201d Pham says.</p><p>Within months, he learned he could attend college on a scholarship. He moved to Chicago in August 1980 to study at the<a href=\"https://nl.edu/national-college-of-education/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> National College of Education</a>, then he transferred to<a href=\"https://www.neiu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Northeastern Illinois University</a>, also in Chicago, earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and computer science in 1982.</p><p>Encouraged by mentors, he earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics at the<a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Illinois</a> at Urbana-Champaign in 1984, followed by a Ph.D. in reliability engineering at the <a href=\"https://www.buffalo.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">State University of New York at Buffalo</a> in 1989.</p><h2>When failure is not an option</h2><p>Pham\u2019s research direction crystallized in 1988 while searching for a dissertation topic. He was reading the January 1988 issue of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/\" target=\"_self\"> <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em></a> and had a flash of inspiration after seeing a classified ad posted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Defense Department</a>\u2019s Naval Underwater System Center (now known as the <a href=\"https://tethys.pnnl.gov/organization/naval-undersea-warfare-center-nuwc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Naval Undersea Warfare Center</a>). The ad asked, \u201cCan your theories solve the unsolvable?\u201d It focused on the reliability of undersea communication and combat decision-making systems.</p><p>The ad revealed to him that institutions were actively applying mathematics and statistics to solve engineering problems. Pham says he still keeps a copy of that <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> issue in his office.</p><p>After completing his Ph.D., he joined<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing</a> as a senior specialist engineer at its Renton, Wash., facility, working on engine reliability for the<a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/commercial/777\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 777</a> aircraft, which was under development.</p><p>He worked there for 18 months, then accepted a senior engineering specialist position at the<a href=\"https://inl.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Idaho National Laboratory</a>, in Idaho Falls, where he worked on nuclear systems.</p><p>His desire to become an instructor never left him, however. In 1993 he joined Rutgers as an assistant professor of industrial and systems engineering.</p><p>Today his research focuses on reliability in modern, data-intensive systems, including<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_self\"> AI</a> infrastructure and global<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-centers\" target=\"_self\"> data centers</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe problem now isn\u2019t getting data,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing which data to trust.\u201d</p><h2>Charting his IEEE journey</h2><p>Pham joined IEEE in 1985 as a student member and credits the organization with shaping much of his professional life. IEEE provided a platform for scholarship, collaboration, and visibility at critical moments in his career, he says.</p><p>He served as associate technical editor of<a href=\"https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-magazine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Communications Magazine</em></em></a> from 1992 to 2000, was a guest editor for a special issue on fault-tolerant software in the June 1993<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17387&amp;tip=sid#google_vignette\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Reliability</em></em></a>, and was the program vice chair of the annual IEEE<a href=\"https://rams.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Reliability and Maintainability Symposium</a> in 1994. In 2024 he returned to Vietnam as a plenary speaker at the 16th <a href=\"https://sice-si.org/SII2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration</a>.</p><p>In addition to being named a distinguished professor at Rutgers, he served as chair of the<a href=\"https://www.ise.rutgers.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> industrial and systems engineering department</a> from 2007 to 2013.</p><p>\u201cIf my journey holds one lesson,\u201d he says, \u201cit is this: Struggle builds resilience, and resilience makes the extraordinary possible.

That\u2019s a 36 percent jump from the company\u2019s previous outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and\u2014perhaps most significantly\u2014a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that could turn the data center boom into a bust.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_1\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p>The power grid engineering workforce is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/power-engineering-workforce-gap\" target=\"_self\">currently shrinking</a>, and data center operators are also hurting for trained <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-jobs\" target=\"_self\">electrical engineers</a>. Laura Laltrello, the chief operating officer for <a href=\"https://www.applieddigital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Applied Digital</a>, says demand has accelerated for civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers, as well as construction management and oversight positions in recent months. (Applied Digital is a data center developer and operator that is building two data center campuses near Harwood, North Dakota, that will require 1.4 GW of power when completed.) The growing demand for skilled workers has forced her company to widen the recruitment perimeter.</p><p>\u201cAs we anticipate a shortage of traditional engineering talent, we are sourcing from diverse industries,\u201d says Laltrello. \u201cWe are finding experts who understand power and cooling from sectors like nuclear energy, the military, and aerospace. Expertise doesn\u2019t have to come from a data center background.\u201d</p><h2>Growing Demand for Data Center Engineers</h2><p>For every engineer needed to design, specify, build, inspect, commission, or run a new AI data center, dozens of other positions are in short supply. According to the Association for Computer Operations and Management\u2019s (AFCOM) <a href=\"https://afcom.com/news/news.asp?id=692525\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Data Center Report 2025</a>, 58 percent of data center managers<span> </span>identified multiskilled data center operators as the top area of growth, while 50 percent signaled increasing demand for data center engineers. Security specialists are also a critical need.</p><p>Through the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for almost <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-14/whats-behind-the-projected-construction-employment-growth-from-2023-to-2033.htm\" target=\"_blank\">400,000 more construction workers by 2033</a>. By far the biggest needs are in power infrastructure, electricians, plumbing, and HVAC, <a target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and roughly </a><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">17,500 electrical and electronics engineers</a>.<span> </span>These categories directly map to the skills required to design, build, commission, and operate modern data centers.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is not simply the absolute number of workers available, but the timing and intensity of demand,\u201d says Bill Kleyman, author of the AFCOM report and the CEO of AI infrastructure firm <a href=\"https://www.apolo.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Apolo</a>. \u201cData centers are expanding at the same time that utilities, manufacturing, renewables, grid infrastructure, and construction are all competing for the same skilled labor pool, and AI is amplifying this pressure.\u201d</p><p>Data center developers like <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a> and construction firms like <a href=\"https://www.crusoe.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Crusoe</a> face enormous demands to build faster, bigger, and more power-dense facilities. For example, they\u2019re developing the Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, for Oracle and OpenAI. The project has two buildings that went live in October 2025, with another six scheduled for completion by the middle of 2026. The entire AI data center campus, once completed, will require 1.2 GW of power.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_6\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-mcnamara-1055211/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael McNamara</a>, the CEO of <a href=\"https://lancium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lancium</a>, says that in one year his company can currently build enough AI data center infrastructure to require 1 GW of power. Big tech firms, he says, want this raised to 1 GW a quarter and eventually 1 GW per month or less.</p><p>That kind of ramp-up of construction pace calls for tens of thousands more engineers. The shortage of engineering talent is paralleled by persistent staffing shortages in data center operations and facility management professionals, electrical and mechanical technicians, high-voltage and power systems engineers, skilled HVAC technicians with experience in high-density or liquid cooling, and construction specialists familiar with complex mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) integration, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhawkins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Hawkins</a>, the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>director of education for Uptime Institute.</p><p>\u201cDemand for each category is rising significantly faster than supply,\u201d says Hawkins.</p><p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>Technical colleges and applied education programs are among the most effective engines for workforce growth in the data center industry. They focus on hands-on skills, facilities operations, power and cooling systems, and real-world job readiness. With so many new data centers being built in Texas, workforce programs are popping up all over that state. One example is the SMU Lyle School of Engineering\u2019s Master of Science in Datacenter Systems Engineering (MS DSE) in Dallas. The program blends electrical engineering, IT, facilities management, business continuity, and cybersecurity. There is also a 12-week AI data center technician program at Dallas College and a similar program at Texas State Technical College near Waco.</p><p>\u201cTechnical colleges are driving the charge in bringing new talent to an industry undergoing exponential growth with an almost infinite appetite for skilled workers,\u201d says Wendy Schuchart, an association manager at AFCOM.</p><p>Vendors and industry associations are actively addressing the talent gap too. Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/datacenteracademy.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Datacenter Academy</a> is a public-private partnership involving community colleges in regions where Microsoft operates data center facilities. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://datacenters.google/workforce-development-program/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google supports</a> local nonprofits and colleges offering training in IT and data center operations, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/technical-apprenticeships\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon offers data center apprenticeships</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/us/en/products/energy/low-voltage/siemens-educates-america.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Siemens Educates America</a> program has surpassed 32,000 apprenticeships across 32 states, 36 labs, and 72 partner industry labor organizations. The company has committed to training 200,000 electricians and electrical manufacturing workers by 2030. Similarly, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) operates the <a href=\"https://www.electricaltrainingalliance.org/AboutUs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Electrical Training Alliance</a>; the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) offers <a href=\"https://learn.toolingu.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ToolingU-SME</a>, aimed at expanding<strong> </strong>the manufacturing workforce; and <a href=\"https://uptimeinstitute.com/education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uptime Institute Education</a><strong> </strong>programs look to accelerate the readiness of technicians and operators.<span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/feeds/feed.rss#_msocom_12\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p><p>\u201cEvery university we speak with is thinking about this challenge and shifting its curriculum to prepare students for the future of digital infrastructure,\u201d said Laltrello. \u201cThe best way to predict the future is to build it.\u201d</p>"

Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills\u2014capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace.</p><p>AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybercrime\" target=\"_self\">cybercrime</a>, predict equipment failures in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stealthy-startup-aims-to-reinvent-ai-for-manufacturing\" target=\"_self\">manufacturing</a>, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-jobs\" target=\"_self\">mass layoffs</a> across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals.</p><p>Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/discover-manager-credit-card-fraud\" target=\"_self\">banking</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotic-process-automation-gokul-pandy\" target=\"_self\">health care</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/abhishek-agrawal-amazon-catalog-ai\" target=\"_self\">retail</a>, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making\u2014and keep up with the competition.</p><p>The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/profiles/san-murugesan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Murugesan</a> and<a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rneamtu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Rodica Neamtu</a>.</p><p>Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at <a href=\"https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Western Sydney University</a>, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at <a href=\"https://www.wpi.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, in Massachusetts.</p><p>The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains.</p><p>The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework.</p><h2>Why AI careers are being redefined</h2><p>AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy.</p><p>Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write.</p><p>The guide cites surveys of executives about AI\u2019s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey & Co.</a> The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants\u2019 insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate.</p><p>The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve.</p><h2>Developing complementary skills</h2><p>The strategic approach aligns with advice from <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/neil-thompson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Thompson</a>, director of FutureTech research at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it.</p><p>\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,\u201d he says. \u201cApplying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.\u201d</p><h2>The technical foundation still matters</h2><p>Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data,<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning\" target=\"_self\"> machine learning</a>, and computing infrastructure.</p><p>Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say.</p><p>Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say.</p><p>Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Web Services</a>,<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Cloud</a>, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmfq865whp_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21503043035&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_sCA_X2u0APALLSysANK0Vhk&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lubfghGwriw2ZaILxIzXBmcfubq9iMM4PqzkwhBGATSfLfbOtvCx7YaAjz5EALw_wcB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure</a> is important, according to the guide\u2019s authors.</p><p>Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2025\" target=\"_self\">Python</a> has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models.</p><h2>From algorithms to frameworks</h2><p>The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PyTorch</a>, developed by <a href=\"https://www.meta.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meta AI</a>, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scikit-learn</a> provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cWhen we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. <strong>\u2014Neil Thompson, MIT</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TensorFlow</a>, a software library for machine learning and AI created by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?zx=1767047914659&amp;no_sw_cr=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction.</p><p>The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints.</p><h2>Soft skills as career insurance</h2><p>Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders.</p><p>Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning.</p><p>Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt.</p><h2>Experience before titles</h2><p>The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience.</p><p>Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career.</p><h2>Entry-level roles that open doors</h2><p>Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide.</p><p>Each starting point reinforces the guide\u2019s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance.</p><h2>Curiosity as a long-term strategy</h2><p>Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process.</p><p>\u201cAlways be curious,\u201d he says. \u201cLearn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.\u201d</p><p>Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one\u2019s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend.</p><p>In a field where today\u2019s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide\u2019s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.</p>"

Both are interwoven with conductive materials such as stainless steel threads, which form a Faraday cage that shields the wearer against the lines\u2019 electric fields. But the standard suits have limited capacity to shunt current because usually they don\u2019t need to. Like a bird on a wire, bare-hands workers are electrically floating, rather than grounded, so current largely bypasses them via the line itself.</p><h2>Induction Safety Suit Design</h2><p>Backed by a US $250,000 investment from Xcel in 2019, Electrostatics adapted its standard suits by adding low-resistance conductive straps that pass current around a worker\u2019s body. \u201cWhen I\u2019m touching a conductor with one hand and the other hand is grounded, the current will flow through the straps to get out,\u201d says <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/n%25C3%25A9meth-b%25C3%25A1lint-1a366586?originalSubdomain=hu\" target=\"_blank\">B\u00e1lint N\u00e9meth</a>, Electrostatics\u2019 CEO and director of the <a href=\"https://nfl.vet.bme.hu/en/\" target=\"_blank\">High Voltage Laboratory</a> at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A man holds one side of his jacket open revealing conductive straps inside.  \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c7b7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-holds-one-side-of-his-jacket-open-revealing-conductive-straps-inside.jpg?id=62695052&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A strapping system links all the elements of the suit\u2014the jacket, trousers, gloves, and socks\u2014and guides current through a controlled path outside the body. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">BME HVL </small></p><p>The company began selling the suits in 2023, and they have since been adopted by over a dozen transmission operators in the United States and Europe, as well as other countries including Canada, Indonesia, and Turkey.

A perfectly coiffed woman from the secretarial pool then takes the recordings and neatly types them up, with carbon copies of course.</p><p>I had no idea the Dictaphone actually had its roots in the 19th century and a rivalry between two early tech giants: Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison. And although it took decades to take hold in the modern office, it found novel uses in other fields.</p><h2>Who invented the Dictaphone?</h2><p>The Dictaphone was born from the competition and the cooperation of Bell and Edison and their capable teams of researchers. In 1877, Edison had introduced <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/edisons-phonograph\" target=\"_blank\">the phonograph</a>, which he later declared <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2022/03/thomas-edisons-favorite-invention-the-phonograph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his favorite invention</a>. And yet he wasn\u2019t quite certain about its commercial applications. Initially, he thought it might be good for recording telephone messages. Then he began to imagine other uses: a mechanical stenographer for businessmen, a notetaker for students, an elocution instructor, a talking book for the blind. The playback of recorded music\u2014the phonograph\u2019s eventual killer app\u2014was No. 4 on <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edison\u2019s list</a>. And after a few public demonstrations, he set aside the invention to pursue other interests.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an apparatus consisting of a metal cylinder on a metal rod with a handle, seated on a flat rectangular base. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b77c1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-an-apparatus-consisting-of-a-metal-cylinder-on-a-metal-rod-with-a-handle-seated-on-a-flat-rectangular.jpg?id=62563774&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Thomas Edison\u2019s early phonograph from 1877 used a needle to record sound waves on a rotating cylinder wrapped with tinfoil. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Thomas Edison National Historical Park/National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior</small></p><p>Enter Bell. In 1880, the French government had awarded Bell the Volta Prize and 50,000 francs (about US $10,000 at the time) for his invention of the telephone. The following year, he, his cousin Chichester A. Bell, and Charles Sumner Tainter used the prize money to found the Volta Laboratory Association in Washington, D.C., to do research on sound recording and transmission.</p><p class=\"ieee-inbody-related\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/particle-physics-resurrects-alexander-graham-bells-voice\" target=\"_self\">Particle Physics Resurrects Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s Voice</a></p><p>Tainter saw potential in the phonograph. Edison\u2019s version used a needle to etch sound waves on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a metal cylinder. The foil was easily damaged, the sound quality was distorted and squeaky, and the cylinder could be replayed only a few times before degrading and becoming inaudible. Edison\u2019s phonograph couldn\u2019t be easily commercialized, in other words.</p><p>Chichester Bell and Tainter greatly improved the sound quality by replacing the tinfoil with <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/\" target=\"_blank\">wax-coated cardboard cylinders</a>. By 1886, the researchers at Volta Lab had a <a href=\"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/da/79/62/6a4a3e32433adc/US341214.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">patented product</a>: the Graphophone.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Engraving of a man sitting on a chair and holding a tube to his mouth.

As a \u201cdictator,\u201d you would speak into the tube, and a stylus would trace the sound wave on the wax cylinder. The cylinder would then be handed off to a secretary for transcription. Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary.</p><p>A manufacturing company set up by Volta Lab sold several machines to the U.S. government. One enthusiastic early adopter was Edward D. Easton, a noted stenographer for the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Easton took notes in shorthand, he immediately recited his notes into the Graphophone after each session.</p><p>Easton became an evangelist for the instrument, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Phonogram1_4/page/n5/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">writing glowing accounts</a> in a trade magazine. The machine made no mistakes and could take dictation as fast as the speaker could articulate. The phonograph never complained when a transcriber needed a phrase repeated. The phonograph didn\u2019t suffer from poor penmanship. Anyone could learn to use the machine in two weeks or less, compared to months or years to master stenography. Such were Easton\u2019s claims. (Easton was such a fan that he cofounded the Columbia Phonograph Co., which went on to become a leading maker of phonographs and recorded music and lives on today as <a href=\"https://www.columbiarecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia Records</a>.)</p><p>Before long, several companies were manufacturing and selling phonographs and dictation machines. Even though demand was initially light, patent-infringement lawsuits sprang up, which soon threatened to bankrupt all of the companies involved. Finally, in 1896, the various parties agreed to stop fighting and to cross-license each other\u2019s intellectual property. This didn\u2019t end the Bell-Edison rivalry, but it allowed the phonograph business to take off in earnest, aided by the sales of mass-produced recorded music cylinders. And the accepted name for this entertainment machine became the phonograph.</p><h2>The Dictaphone Gets Down to Business</h2><p>But Bell, Tainter, and Edison didn\u2019t forget the original promise of mechanical stenography, and the rivals soon came out with competing and very similar products designed specifically for dictation: the Dictaphone and the Ediphone. The public found it difficult to distinguish the two products, and it wasn\u2019t long before \u201cdictaphone\u201d was being used to describe all dictation machines. (The Columbia Graphophone Co. trademarked \u201cDictaphone\u201d in 1907\u2014a confusing neologism of <em><em>dicta</em></em> from the Latin for \u201csayings\u201d or \u201csay repeatedly\u201d and <em><em>phone</em></em> from the Greek for \u201cvoice\u201d or \u201csound.\u201d)</p><p>As David Morton recounts in his 1999 book <em><em>Off the Record</em></em> (Rutgers University Press), Dictaphone sales accelerated as scientific management for business began to take root. Office managers intent on streamlining, standardizing, and systemizing workflows saw the Dictaphone as a labor-saving device. In 1912, for instance, an efficiency commission set up by U.S. President William Taft endorsed the use of dictation machines in government offices. The railroad and insurance industries followed suit as they standardized their financial records. Later, managers began using dictation machines to conquer their business correspondence.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of an older man with a moustache holding a tube near his mouth.

The U.S. government was an early adopter of the machines.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Library of Congress</small></p><p>And yet, the Dictaphone wasn\u2019t obviously destined to become an indispensable piece of office equipment like the typewriter. In 1923, for instance, 15,000 dictation machines were sold in the United States, versus 744,000 typewriters.</p><p>In 1926, the Dictaphone Corp. tried to drum up interest by sponsoring Henry Lunn, founder of a large U.K. travel company, on an around-the-world lecture tour. At each hotel he visited, the company ensured there was a Dictaphone for Lunn to record his diary. Consider this a prototype for the modern hotel business center. At the end of his journey, Lunn published <em><em>Round the World With a Dictaphone</em></em>\u2014part travelogue, part proselytizing for Christian churches to support the League of Nations, and part Dictaphone promotion. Even so, by 1945, Dictaphone estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of the potential market had been captured.</p><p>There were social reasons working against dictation machines, Morton says in his book. Executives relied on their secretaries not only for dictation and transcription, but also for their often unacknowledged aid in prompting, correcting, and filling in their bosses\u2019 thoughts\u2014the soft skills that a machine could not replace.</p><p>Morton also attributes the slow uptake to the technology itself. One quirk of the Dictaphone is that it continued to use wax cylinders long after phonograph players had switched to discs. Transcribers often complained that the wax recordings were unintelligible\u2014dictators needed to speak directly into the speaking tube, loudly, clearly, and at an appropriate pace, but many did not.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman sitting at a manual typewriter and wearing headphones that connect to a machine. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"df276\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-sitting-at-a-manual-typewriter-and-wearing-headphones-that-connect-to-a-machine.jpg?id=62564524&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">A secretary plays back the sound from a recorded Ediphone cylinder in 1930 to transcribe the cylinder\u2019s contents.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Popperfoto/Getty Images</small></p><p>During World War II, Dictaphone finally ditched the wax cylinders in favor of etching grooves on a plastic belt, although the new machines were available only to U.S. government agencies until the end of the war. In 1947, the company publicly introduced the new technology with its Time-Master series. Each Dictabelt held about 15 minutes of recording. Meanwhile, Edison\u2019s Ediphone was rebranded the <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2016/09/15/take-a-memo/\" target=\"_blank\">Voicewriter</a> and recorded on distinctive red plastic discs.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Color photo of a rectangular device with a long cord and microphone and 3 reddish discs with a hole in the middle. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f63d1\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/color-photo-of-a-rectangular-device-with-a-long-cord-and-microphone-and-3-reddish-discs-with-a-hole-in-the-middle.jpg?id=62564655&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">This 1953 Edison Voicewriter recorded the speaker\u2019s voice on plastic Diamond Discs. Magnetic tape came later.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian Design Museum/Smithsonian Institution</small></p><p>In the 1960s, Dictaphone finally embraced magnetic recording tape, in the form of cassette tapes. Pressure initially came from European companies, such as the Dutch electronics company Philips, which entered the U.S. market in 1958 with a low-priced tape-cartridge machine. Four years later, Philips introduced the Compact Cassette, which became the basis of today\u2019s audio cassette. Transistorized electronics furthered miniaturization and made dictation machines much more portable. Eventually, solid-state storage replaced magnetic tape, and today, we all carry around a dictation device with an effectively infinite recording time via cloud storage, and, if we choose to use it, automatic transcription.</p><h2>The Dictaphone in the Classroom</h2><p>None of the stories about businessmen using (or abusing) Dictaphones really surprised me. What did surprise me were the creative ways the Dictaphone was used as a pedagogical tool.</p><p>In 1924, for example, Dwight Everett Watkins at the University of California described in a paper how his students used a microphone, an amplifier, a telemegaphone (a type of speaker), and a Dictaphone to aid in public speaking. The setup helped students understand their rhetorical imperfections: bad grammar and bad sentence and paragraph structure. It also helped with elocution\u2014one of the early applications that Edison envisioned for his phonograph.</p><p>In 1933, George F. Meyer wrote about using the Dictaphone as an educational aid for blind and low-vision students in Minneapolis. Teachers recorded course material that would otherwise have had to be read aloud. And the students liked being able to listen to the material repeatedly without inconveniencing a human reader.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Black and white photo of a woman seated to the left and typing on a typewriter, with a crowd of young women standing around her wearing headphones that connect to a machine at the typist\\u2019s side.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"568fe\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-photo-of-a-woman-seated-to-the-left-and-typing-on-a-typewriter-with-a-crowd-of-young-women-standing-around-her.jpg?id=62564721&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Students in 1930 listen to a Dictaphone recording, which the seated woman controls with foot pedals.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images</small></p><p>In 1938, Frances M. Freeman wrote her master\u2019s thesis on whether the Dictaphone could help typing students who were struggling to master the skill. Her study was supported by the Dictaphone Sales Corp., but unfortunately for the company, she concluded that using a Dictaphone offered no advantage in learning to type. She did find that the students in the Dictaphone group seemed more alert in class than students taught the traditional way.</p><p>That last finding was borne out in a 1964 experiment at Dunbar Elementary School in New Orleans, where the Dictaphone Corp. had outfitted an \u201celectronic classroom.\u201d The idea was to help reluctant students by fostering an environment where learning was fun. As Principal Beulah E. Brown related in an article about the experiment, she\u2019d first encountered a Dictaphone several years earlier while on sabbatical and immediately saw its pedagogical potential. The Dictaphone, Brown wrote, promised individually tailored educational experiences, allowing students to focus on specific challenges and freeing the teacher to have more personal interactions with each child. Testimonials from Warren Honore\u2019s fifth grade class attest to its success as an engaging technology.</p><h2>From the Dictaphone to Email to AI</h2><p>As a historian of technology, I loved learning that two heavyweights in the field, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/us/melvin-kranzberg-78-historian-of-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">Melvin Kranzberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Kuhn</a>, were both committed fans of the Dictaphone. I also enjoyed meditating on the role of the dictaphone and other technology as a mediator in the writing process.</p><p>My research turned up <a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/tolstoys-dictaphone\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Tolstoy\u2019s Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse</em></em></a> (Graywolf Press), a 1996 collection of essays edited by the literary critic <a href=\"https://agnionline.bu.edu/about/our-people/authors/sven-birkerts/\" target=\"_blank\">Sven Birkerts</a><em><em>. </em></em>The title comes from an anecdote about the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who refused the offer of a Dictaphone because it would be \u201ctoo dreadfully exciting\u201d and would distract him from his literary pursuits. To form the volume, Birkerts posed questions to his authors concerning the place of self and soul in a society being bombarded with new forms of communication\u2014namely, email and the internet.</p><p>Today, of course, our world is being shaped by AI, arguably an even bigger disrupter than email was in the 1990s or the Dictaphone was in the early 20th century. But then, technology is always trying to remake society, and the path it takes is never inevitable. Sometimes, when we\u2019re lucky, it is delightfully surprising.</p><p><em>Part of a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/\" target=\"_self\">continuing series</a> looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology.</em></p><p><span><em>An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2026 print issue as \u201cThis Machine Listened to \u2018Dictators.\u2019 \u201d</em></span></p><h3>References</h3><br /><p>David Morton emailed me and suggested I write about the Dictaphone after hearing me <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1127295581\" target=\"_blank\">give a talk</a> about this series.

Many of these approaches require a change in the materials used for computation, which would demand an overhaul in the CMOS fabrication techniques used today.</span></p><p>Over the past decade, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-hector-j-de-los-santos-phd-ieee-fellow-6111291/\" target=\"_blank\">Hector De Los Santos</a> has been working on yet another new approach. The technique would require the same exact materials used in CMOS, preserving the costly equipment, yet still allow computations to be performed in a radically different way. Instead of the motion of individual electrons\u2014current\u2014computations can be done with the collective, wavelike propagations in a sea of electrons, known as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanosensors-perform-sensing-on-demand\" target=\"_self\">plasmons</a>.</p><p>De Los Santos, an IEEE Fellow, first <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5233891\" target=\"_blank\">proposed the idea</a> of computing with plasmons back in 2010. More recently, in 2024, De Los Santos and collaborators from University of South Carolina, Ohio State University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/14/6/065321/3297922\" target=\"_blank\">created a device</a> that demonstrated the main component of plasmon-based logic: the ability to control one plasmon with another. We caught up with De Los Santos to understand the details of this novel technological proposal.</p><h2>How Plasmon Computing Works</h2><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: How did you first come up with the idea for plasmon computing?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> I got the idea of plasmon computing around 2009, upon observing the direction in which the field of CMOS logic was going. In particular, they were following the downscaling paradigm in which, by reducing the size of transistors, you would cram more and more transistors in a certain area, and that would increase the performance. However, if you follow that paradigm to its conclusion, as the device sizes are reduced, quantum mechanical effects come into play, as well as leakage. When the devices are very small, a number of effects called short channel effects come into play, which manifest themselves as increased power dissipation.</p><p>So I began to think, \u201cHow can we solve this problem of improving the performance of logic devices while using the same fabrication techniques employed for CMOS\u2014that is, while exploiting the current infrastructure?\u201d I came across an old logic paradigm called fluidic logic, which uses <a href=\"https://plcsitemiz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/modern-control-engineering-kogata-3rd-edition.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">fluids</a>. For example, jets of air whose direction was impacted by other jets of air could implement logic functions. So I had the idea, why don\u2019t we implement a paradigm analogous to that one, but instead of using air as a fluid, we use localized electron charge density waves\u2014plasmons. Not electrons, but electron disturbances.</p><p>And now the timing is very appropriate because, as most people know, AI is very power intensive. People are coming against a brick wall on how to go about solving the power consumption issue, and the current technology is not going to solve that problem.</p><p><strong>What is a plasmon, exactly?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> Plasmons are basically the disturbance of the electron density. If you have what is called an electron sea, you can imagine a pond of water. When you disturb the surface, you create waves. And these waves, the undulations on the surface of this water, propagate through the water. That is an almost perfect analogy to plasmons. In the case of plasmons, you have a sea of electrons. And instead of using a pebble or a piece of wood tapping on the surface of the water to create a wave that propagates, you tap this sea of electrons with an electromagnetic wave.</p><p><strong>How do plasmons promise to overcome the scaling issues of traditional CMOS logic? </strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> Going back to the analogy of the throwing the pebble on the pond: It takes very, very low energy to create this kind of disturbance. The energy to excite a plasmon is on the order of attojoules or less. And the disturbance that you generate propagates very fast. A disturbance propagates faster than a particle. Plasmons propagate in unison with the electromagnetic wave that generates them, which is the speed of light in the medium. So just intrinsically, the way of operation is extremely fast and extremely low power compared to current technology.</p><p>In addition to that, current CMOS technology dissipates power even if it\u2019s not used. Here, that\u2019s not the case. If there is no wave propagating, then there is no power dissipation.</p><p><strong>How do you do logic operations with plasmons?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> You pattern long, thin wires in a configuration in the shape of the letter Y. At the base of the Y you launch a plasmon. Call this the bias plasmon, this is the bit. If you don\u2019t do anything, when this plasmon gets to the junction it will split in two, so at the output of the Y, you will detect two equal electric field strengths.</p><p>Now, imagine that at the Y junction you apply another wire at an angle to the incoming wire. Along that new wire, you send another plasmon, called a control plasmon. You can use the control plasmon to redirect the original bias plasmon into one leg of the Y.</p><p>Plasmons are charge disturbances, and two plasmons have the same nature: They either are both positive or both negative. So, they repel each other if you force them to converge into a junction. And by controlling the angle of the control plasmon impinging on the junction, you can control the angle of the plasmon coming out of the junction. And that way you can steer one plasmon with another one. The control plasmon simply joins the incoming plasmon, so you end up with double the voltage on one leg.</p><p>You can do this from both sides, add a wire and a control plasmon on either side of the junction so you can redirect the plasmon into either leg of the Y, giving you a zero or a one.</p><h2>Building a Plasmon-Based Logic Device<br /></h2><p><strong>You\u2019ve built this Y-junction device and demonstrated steering a plasmon to one side in 2024. Can you describe the device and its operation?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> The Y-junction device is about 5 square [micrometers]. The Y is made up of the following: a metal on top of an oxide, on top of a semiconducting wafer, on top of a ground plane. Now, between the oxide and the wafer, you have to generate a charge density\u2014this is the sea of electrons. To do that, you apply a DC voltage between the metal of the Y and the ground plane, and that generates your static sea of electrons. Then you impinge upon that with an incoming electromagnetic wave, again between the metal and ground plane. When the electromagnetic wave reaches the static charge density, the sea of electrons that was there generates a localized electron charge density disturbance: a plasmon.</p><p>Now, if you launch a plasmon by itself, it will quickly dissipate. It will not propagate very far.<strong> </strong>In my setup, the reason why the plasmon survives is because it is being regenerated. As the electromagnetic field propagates, you keep regenerating the plasmons, creating new plasmons at its front end.</p><p><strong>What is left to be done before you can implement full computer logic?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> I demonstrated the partial device, that is just the interaction of two plasmons. The next step would be to demonstrate and fabricate the full device, which would have the two controls. And after that gets done, the next step is concatenating them to create a full adder, because that is the fundamental computing logic component.</p><p><strong>What do you think are going to be the main challenges going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>De Los Santos:</strong> I think the main challenge is that the technology doesn\u2019t follow from today\u2019s paradigm of logic devices based on current flows. This is based on wave flows. People are accustomed to other things, and it may be difficult to understand the device. The different concepts that are brought together in this device are not normally employed by the dominant technology, and it is really interdisciplinary in nature. You have to know about metal-oxide-semiconductor physics, then you have to know about electromagnetic waves, then you have to know about quantum field theory. The knowledge base to understand the device rarely exists in a single head. Maybe another next step is to try to make it more accessible. Getting people to sponsor the work and to understand it is a challenge, not really the implementation. There\u2019s not really a fabrication limitation. </p><p>But in my opinion, the usual approaches are just doomed, for two reasons. First, they are not reversible, meaning information is lost in the computation, which results in energy loss. Second, as the devices shrink energy dissipation increases, posing an insurmountable barrier. In contrast, plasmon computation is inherently reversible, and there is no fundamental reason it should dissipate any energy during switching.<strong></strong></p>"
