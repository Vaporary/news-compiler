        "summary": "Declining U.S. college enrollments over the past 15 years have triggered questions about the health of the postsecondary sector. Using institution-level data, we make four points. First, such declines are driven not by the four-year sector but by two-year community colleges, which have apparently shrunk by over 30% since the peak of the Great Recession. Second, over one-third of this apparent decline is an artifact of some community colleges being reclassified as offering four-year degrees. Third, pre-Great Recession data shows a 1 percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate increases first-time community college enrollment by 2 percent, suggesting many students are on the margin between community college and job opportunities. For-profit college enrollments are similarly countercyclical, while public and private four-year college enrollments appear acyclical. Our estimates suggest that strengthening labor markets explain about 60% of the post-Great Recession decline in first-time community college enrollment. Fourth, students whose enrollment decisions are most sensitive to labor market conditions appear unlikely to have completed a degree. Though declining community college enrollments are a challenge for postsecondary institutions, it is less clear whether they signal a problem for students on the margin of enrollment."

        "summary": "This paper characterizes the equity\u2013efficiency tradeoff of corporate taxation using a stylized model that draws on the corporate investment and tax incidence literatures. We derive optimal corporate tax formulas in terms of estimable reduced-form elasticities and welfare weights on workers and firm owners. While much empirical work emphasizes investment responses, these elasticities do not feature in optimal tax formulas. The elasticity of taxable profits is a sufficient statistic for the efficiency costs of the corporate tax. Higher corporate tax rates are desirable when firm owners have low welfare weights, and less desirable when taxing profits reduces wages. These empirical objects remain central across extensions, including heterogeneous production technologies, tax sheltering, international capital mobility, monopsony, and linear labor income taxes. We survey the empirical literature and find that existing estimates can support a wide range of optimal tax rates. An inverse-optimum analysis provides combinations of welfare weights of workers and firm owners that would rationalize the post-2017 US corporate tax cut as optimal."

        "summary": "We study the rapid expansion of Brazil's private online higher-education sector and its effects on market structure and college enrollment. Exploiting regional and field-specific variation in online education penetration, we find that online programs expand access for older students but divert younger students from higher-quality in-person programs. Greater competition lowers tuition prices but also reduces the supply of in-person degrees. Using an equilibrium model of college education, we show that in the absence of online programs, total enrollment would be 14 percent lower, while in-person enrollment would rise by 33 percent. On net, aggregate labor-market value added declines by 1.4 percent. Online education raises value added for older students, who benefit from increased access, but lowers it for younger students, who shift toward lower-return online options. Counterfactual policies that restrict online enrollment to older cohorts could increase value added for younger students without reducing gains for older cohorts."

I noted then, and it\u2019s still true two decades later: Software failures are universally unbiased. They happen in every country, to large companies and small. They happen in commercial, nonprofit, and governmental organizations, regardless of status or reputation.</p><p>Global IT spending has more than tripled in constant 2025 dollars since 2005, from US $1.7 trillion to $5.6 trillion, and continues to rise. Despite additional spending, software success rates have not markedly improved in the past two decades. The result is that the business and societal costs of failure continue to grow as software proliferates, permeating and interconnecting every aspect of our lives.</p><p>For those hoping AI software tools and coding copilots will quickly make large-scale IT software projects successful, forget about it. For the foreseeable future, there are hard limits on what AI can bring to the table in controlling and managing the myriad intersections and trade-offs among systems engineering, project, financial, and business management, and especially the organizational politics involved in any large-scale software project. Few IT projects are displays of rational decision-making from which AI can or should learn. As software practitioners know, IT projects suffer from enough management hallucinations and delusions without AI adding to them.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>As I noted 20 years ago, the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">drivers of software failure</a> frequently are failures of human imagination, unrealistic or unarticulated project goals, the inability to handle the project\u2019s complexity, or unmanaged risks, to name a few that today still regularly cause IT failures. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Numerous others</a> go back decades, such as those identified by Stephen Andriole, the chair of business technology at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Villanova University</a>\u2019s School of Business, in the diagram below first published in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveandriole/2021/03/25/3-main-reasons-why-big-technology-projects-fail---why-many-companies-should-just-never-do-them/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forbes</em></a> in 2021. Uncovering a software system failure that has gone off the rails in a unique, previously undocumented manner would be surprising because the overwhelming majority of software-related failures involve avoidable, known failure-inducing factors documented in hundreds of after-action reports, academic studies, and technical and management books for decades.

IT project managers <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/03/the-uniqueness-trap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely claim</a> that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant. In Phoenix\u2019s case, for example, it was the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/bagnall-there-were-lessons-that-might-have-prevented-the-phoenix-pay-disaster-no-one-listened\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second payroll-system replacement attempt</a>, the first effort ending in failure in 1995. Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it\u2019s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.</p><h3>Jaguar Land Rover</h3><br /><img alt=\"The exterior of a building holds Jaguar and LandRover sign\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"04834\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-exterior-of-a-building-holds-jaguar-and-landrover-sign.png?id=62209560&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>A cyberattack forced Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s largest automaker, to shut down its global operations for over a month. An initial FAIR-MAM assessment, a cybersecurity-cost-model, estimates the loss for Jaguar Land Rover to be between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion (\u00a3911 million and \u00a31.4 billion), which has affected its 33,000 employees and some 200,000 employees of its suppliers. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html\" target=\"_blank\">gales of creative destruction</a>.\u201d They\u2019re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/278677/enterprise-resource-planning-10-famous-erp-disasters-dustups-and-disappointments.html\" target=\"_blank\">enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures</a> are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.</p><p>Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT project mismanagement. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995\u2019s payroll-project fiasco? <a href=\"https://www.thealbertan.com/national-news/fixing-problems-with-phoenix-payroll-system-cost-taxpayers-51-billion-official-10851998\" target=\"_blank\">The government maintains it will learn</a>, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure\u2019s high political profile. But will Phoenix\u2019s lessons extend to the <a href=\"https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_202310_07_e_44340.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of outdated Canadian government IT systems</a> needing replacement or modernization? Hopefully, but hope is not a methodology, and purposeful action will be necessary.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>The IT community has striven mightily for decades to make the incomprehensible routine. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>Repeatedly making the same mistakes and expecting a different result is not learning. It is a farcical absurdity. Paraphrasing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Petroski\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Petroski</a> in his book <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/To_Engineer_is_Human/_YWvcD-SFAgC?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design</em></a> (Vintage, 1992), we may have learned how to calculate the software failure due to risk, but we have not learned how to calculate to eliminate the failure of the mind.<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/us-coast-guards-67-million-ehr-fiasco\" target=\"_self\"> </a>There are a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/us-coast-guards-67-million-ehr-fiasco\" target=\"_self\">plethora of examples</a> of projects like Phoenix that failed in part due to bumbling management, yet it is extremely difficult to find software projects managed professionally that still failed. Finding examples of what could be termed \u201cIT heroic failures\u201d is like<a href=\"https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/hetairai/diogenes.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Diogenes</a> seeking one honest man.</p><p>The consequences of not learning from blunders will be much greater and more insidious as society grapples with the growing effects of artificial intelligence, or more accurately, \u201cintelligent\u201d algorithms embedded into software systems. Hints of what might happen if past lessons go unheeded are found in the spectacular early automated decision-making failure of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/michigans-midas-unemployment-system-algorithm-alchemy-that-created-lead-not-gold\" target=\"_self\"> Michigan\u2019s MiDAS unemployment</a> and <a href=\"https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/system/files/2023-09/rrc-accessible-full-report.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Australia\u2019s Centrelink \u201cRobodebt\u201d welfare systems</a>. Both used questionable algorithms to identify deceptive payment claims without human oversight. State officials used MiDAS to accuse tens of thousands of Michiganders of unemployment fraud, while Centrelink officials falsely accused hundreds of thousands of Australians of being welfare cheats. Untold numbers of lives will never be the same because of what occurred. Government officials in Michigan and Australia placed far too much trust in those algorithms. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors\u2019 impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed \u201cmaladministration,\u201d <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057305\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">administrative evil</a> is closer to reality.</p><h3>Lidl Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</h3><br /><img alt=\"The facade of a LIDL food supermarket on a sunny day.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c5f7c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-facade-of-a-lidl-food-supermarket-on-a-sunny-day.png?id=62207832&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2017 </strong></p><p><strong></strong>The international supermarket chain Lidl decides to revert to its homegrown legacy merchandise-management system after three years of trying to make SAP\u2019s \u20ac500 million enterprise resource planning (ERP) system work properly. </p><h3></h3><br /><p>If this behavior happens in government organizations, does anyone think profit-driven companies whose AI-driven systems go wrong are going to act any better?

If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a cybersecurity threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and systems development, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve. This not only means providing the personnel, financial resources, and leadership support and commitment, but also the professional and personal accountability they demand.</p><h3>F-35 Joint Strike Fighter</h3><br /><img alt=\"F-35 fighter jet flying with afterburners lit against a blue sky with scattered clouds.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"215ef\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/f-35-fighter-jet-flying-with-afterburners-lit-against-a-blue-sky-with-scattered-clouds.png?id=62209630&amp;width=980\" /><p><strong>2025</strong></p><p>Software and hardware issues with the F-35 Block 4 upgrade continue unabated.

It will take years more to rollout the capability to the F-35 fleet.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>It is well known that honesty, skepticism, and ethics are essential to achieving project success, yet they are often absent. Only senior management can demand they exist. For instance, honesty begins with the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808603368\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">forthright accounting</a> of the myriad of risks involved in any IT endeavor, not their rationalization. It is a common \u201csecret\u201d that it is far easier to get funding to fix a troubled software development effort than to ask for what is required up front to address the risks involved. Vendor <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8364440\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">puffery</a> may also be legal, but that means the IT customer needs <a href=\"https://csdl-downloads.ieeecomputer.org/mags/co/2024/11/10718683.pdf?Expires=1749318541&amp;Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jc2RsLWRvd25sb2Fkcy5pZWVlY29tcHV0ZXIub3JnL21hZ3MvY28vMjAyNC8xMS8xMDcxODY4My5wZGYiLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE3NDkzMTg1NDF9fX1dfQ__&amp;Signature=mL9v2PDZegXaIyUtFxUhKbp3FdpiW9v9dtWmGzdl9fDmhlRleA25D7IMUwVSezmGnCEalvPnY~uWI8jmDIyd-O3NLGv7~xcKEeqsptxR90hRojhxVZQ0LK2xp5TfQ9LbaWifuXCRCifA4KnGq-mg9yYpFMKnsjBKJp67u5gHHYElV3NBuODy1GYjMflkztyZQcqOHkx2zU5DazT5WgjD76RXYlwF-M9TKk7YdQoW-05OgxNovNL9gq2SJ9Q3tQRtx8uHwxPzjeGKqGJbahqwiaZNKowR7e1fK5uOy02ivsOeel0EQohoyrX305LMyK98hGVSn64c7kS55pFS-TcDHg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K12PMWTCQBDMDT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a healthy skepticism</a> of the typically too-good-to-be-true promises vendors make. Once the contract is signed, it is too late. Furthermore, computing\u2019s malleability, complexity, speed, low cost, and ability to reproduce and store information <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8677333\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">combine to create</a> ethical situations that require deep reflection about computing\u2019s consequences on individuals and society. Alas, ethical considerations have <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9464106\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely lagged</a> when technological progress and profits are to be made. This practice must change, especially as AI is routinely injected into automated systems.</p><p>In the AI community, there has been a movement toward the idea of <a href=\"https://hcil.umd.edu/human-centered-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">human-centered AI</a>, meaning AI systems that prioritize human needs, values, and well-being. This means trying to anticipate where and when AI can go wrong, move to eliminate these situations, and build in ways to mitigate the effects if they do happen. This concept requires application to every IT system\u2019s effort, not just AI.</p><h3></h3><br /><p>Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices...novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems...will also frequently fall short.</p><p><span>Finally, project cost-benefit justifications of software developments rarely consider the financial and emotional distress placed on end users of IT systems when something goes wrong.

If these costs had to be taken fully into account, such as in the cases of Phoenix, MiDAS, and Centrelink, perhaps there could be more realism in what is required managerially, financially, technologically, and experientially to create a successful software system.

Charette can be pretty depressing. Charette, who has been writing about software failures for this magazine for the past 20 years, is a renowned risk analyst and systems expert who over the course of a 50-year career has seen more than his share of delusional thinking among IT professionals, government officials, and corporate executives, before, during, and after massive software failures.</p><p>In 2005\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-software-fails\" target=\"_self\">Why Software Fails</a>,\u201d in <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, a seminal article documenting the causes behind large-scale software failures, Charette noted, \u201cThe biggest tragedy is that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-failure\" target=\"_self\">software failure</a> is for the most part predictable and avoidable. Unfortunately, most organizations don\u2019t see preventing failure as an urgent matter, even though that view risks harming the organization and maybe even destroying it. Understanding why this attitude persists is not just an academic exercise; it has tremendous implications for business and society.\u201d</p><p>Two decades and several trillion wasted dollars later, he finds that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures\" target=\"_blank\">people are making the same mistakes</a>. They claim their project is unique, so past lessons don\u2019t apply. They underestimate complexity. Managers come out of the gate with unrealistic budgets and timelines. Testing is inadequate<strong> </strong>or skipped entirely. Vendor promises that are too good to be true are taken at face value. Newer development approaches like DevOps or AI copilots are implemented without proper training or the organizational change necessary to make the most of them.</p><p>What\u2019s worse, the huge impacts of these missteps on end users aren\u2019t fully accounted for. When the Canadian government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aurO_LK6DEI\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix paycheck system</a> initially failed, for instance, the developers glossed over the protracted financial and emotional distress inflicted on tens of thousands of employees receiving erroneous paychecks; problems persist today, nine years later. Perhaps that\u2019s because, as Charette told me recently, IT project managers don\u2019t have professional licensing requirements and are rarely, if ever, held legally liable for software debacles.</p><p>While medical devices may seem a far cry from giant IT projects, they have a few things in common. As Special Projects Editor Stephen Cass uncovered in this month\u2019s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/medical-device-recalls\" target=\"_blank\">The Data</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-safety/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalls</a> on average 20 medical devices per month due to software issues.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity. We would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem having AWS go down.\u201d <strong>\u2014Robert N. Charette</strong></p><p>Like IT projects, medical devices face fundamental challenges posed by software complexity. Which means that testing, though rigorous and regulated in the medical domain, can\u2019t possibly cover every scenario or every line of code. The major difference between failed medical devices and failed IT projects is that a huge amount of liability attaches to the former.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re building software for medical devices, there are a lot more standards that have to be met and a lot more concern about the consequences of failure,\u201d Charette observes. \u201cBecause when those things don\u2019t work, there\u2019s tort law available, which means manufacturers are on the hook. It\u2019s much harder to bring a case and win when you\u2019re talking about an electronic payroll system.\u201d</p><p>Whether a software failure is hyperlocal, as when a medical device fails inside your body, or spread across an entire region, like when an airline\u2019s ticketing system crashes, organizations need to dig into the root causes and apply those lessons to the next device or IT project if they hope to stop history from repeating itself.</p><p>\u201cSoftware is as significant as electricity,\u201d Charette says. \u201cWe would never put up with electricity going out every other day, but we sure as hell have no problem accepting AWS going down or telcos or banks going out.\u201d He lets out a heavy sigh worthy of A.A. Milne\u2019s Eeyore. \u201cPeople just kind of shrug their shoulders.\u201d</p>"

Yet engineering\u2019s impact lies not only in technical advancement but also in its ability to serve the greater good. This foundational principle is behind IEEE\u2019s public imperative initiatives which apply our efforts and expertise to support our mission to advance technology for humanity with a direct benefit to society. </p><h2>Serving society </h2><p>Public imperative activities and initiatives serve society by promoting understanding, impact for humans and our environment, and responsible use of science and technology. These initiatives encompass a wide range of efforts, including<a href=\"https://move.ieeeusa.org/about/stem-outreach/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> STEM outreach</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeht.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> humanitarian technology deployments</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeeusa.org/public-policy/priorities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> public education on emerging technologies</a>, and<a href=\"https://sustainable-climate.ieee.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> sustainability</a>. Unlike many efforts advancing technology, these initiatives are not designed with financial opportunity in mind. Instead, they fulfill IEEE\u2019s designation as a 501(c)(3) public charity engaged in scientific and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/microcredentials\" target=\"_blank\">educational activities</a> for the benefit of the engineering community and the public.</p><h3>Building a Better World</h3><br /><p>Across the globe, IEEE members and volunteers dedicate their time and use their talents, experiences, and expertise to lead, organize, and drive activities to advance technology for humanity. The<a href=\"https://www.ieee.org/advancing-technology/building-better-world/social-impact-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Social Impact</a> report showcases a selection of recent projects and initiatives that support that mission.</p><p>In my March column, I described my vision for One IEEE, which is aimed at empowering IEEE\u2019s diverse units to work together in ways that magnify their individual and collective impact. Within the framework of One IEEE, public imperative activities are not peripheral; they are central to unifying the organization and amplifying our global relevance. Across IEEE\u2019s varied regions, societies, and technical communities, these activities align efforts around a shared mission. They provide our members from different disciplines and geographies the opportunity to collaborate on projects that transcend boundaries, fostering interdisciplinary innovation and global stewardship.</p><p>Such activities also offer members opportunities to apply their technical expertise in service of societal needs. Whether<a href=\"https://ctu.ieee.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> finding innovative solutions to connect the unconnected</a> or developing<a href=\"https://tryengineering.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> open-source educational tools for students</a>, we are solving real-world problems. The initiatives transform abstract technical knowledge into actionable solutions, reinforcing the idea that technology is not just about building systems\u2014it\u2019s about building futures.</p><p>For our <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/epics-in-ieee-student-projects\" target=\"_blank\">young professionals and students</a>, these activities offer hands-on experiences that connect technical skills with real-world applications, inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in engineering with purpose and passion. These activities also create mentorship opportunities, leadership pathways, and a sense of belonging within the wider IEEE community.</p><h2>Principled tech leader</h2><p>In an age when technology influences practically every aspect of life\u2014from health care and energy to communication and transportation\u2014IEEE must, as a leading technical authority, also serve as a socially responsible leader. Public imperative activities include IEEE\u2019s commitment to ethical development, university and pre-university education, and accessible innovation. They help bridge the gap between technical communities and the public, working to ensure that engineering solutions are accessible, equitable, and aligned with societal values.</p><p>From a strategic standpoint, public imperatives also support IEEE\u2019s long-term sustainability. The organization is redesigning its budget process to emphasize aligning financial resources with mission-driven goals. One of the guiding principles is to publicize IEEE\u2019s public charity status and invest accordingly.</p><p>That means promoting our public imperatives in funding decisions, integrating them into operational planning, and measuring their outcomes with engineering rigor. By treating these activities as core infrastructure, IEEE ensures that its resources are deployed in ways that maximize public benefit and organizational impact.</p><p>Public imperatives are vital to the success of One IEEE. They embody the organization\u2019s mission, unify its global membership, and demonstrate the societal relevance of engineering and technology. They offer our members the opportunity to apply their skills in meaningful ways, contribute to public good, and shape the future of technology with integrity.</p><p>Through our public imperative activities, IEEE is a force for innovation and a driver of meaningful impact.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201c<span>Engineering With Purpose</span>.\u201d</em></p>"

Her early life unfolded in a world defined by scarcity\u2014rationed food, intermittent electricity, and a limited ability to move up or out.

Not long after earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and mathematics in 1985, she applied to get a master\u2019s degree at Cornell, where Hopcroft became her graduate advisor. Rus developed algorithms there for dexterous <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/minimally-actuated-robot-arm-has-lots-of-joints-just-one-clever-motor\" target=\"_self\">robotic manipulation</a>\u2014teaching machines to grasp and move objects with precision.

It\u2019s \u201ca new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time,\u201d <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>.</p><p>Her lab builds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robots-for-hard-problems\" target=\"_self\">soft-body robots inspired by nature</a> that can sense, adapt, and learn. They are AI-driven systems that passively handle tasks\u2014such as self-balancing and complex articulation similar to that done by the human hand\u2014because their shape and materials minimize the need for heavy processing.</p><p>Such machines, she says, someday will be able to navigate different environments, perform useful functions without external control, and even recover from disturbances to their route planning. Researchers also are exploring ways to make them more energy-efficient.</p><p>One prototype developed by Rus\u2019s team is designed to retrieve foreign objects from the body, including batteries swallowed by children. The ingestible robots are artfully folded, similar to origami, so they are small enough to be swallowed. Embedded magnetic materials allow doctors to steer the soft robots and control their shape. Upon arriving in the stomach, a soft bot can be programmed to wrap around a foreign object and guide it safely out of the patient\u2019s body.</p><p>CSAIL researchers also are working on small robots that can carry a medication and release it at a specific area within the digestive tract, bypassing the stomach acid known to diminish some drugs\u2019 efficacy. Ingestible robots also could patch up internal injuries or ulcers. And because they\u2019re made from digestible materials such as sausage casings and biocompatible polymers, the robots can perform their assigned tasks and then get safely absorbed by the body, she says.</p><p>Health care isn\u2019t the only application on the horizon for such AI-driven technologies. Robots with physical intelligence might someday help firefighters locate people trapped in burning buildings, find miners after a cave-in, and provide valuable situational awareness information to emergency response teams in the aftermath of natural disasters, Rus says.</p><p>\u201cWhat excites me is the possibility of giving people new powers,\u201d she says. \u201cMachines that can think and move safely in the physical world will let us extend human reach\u2014at work, at home, in medicine \u2026 everywhere.\u201d</p><p>To make such a vision a reality, she has expanded her technical interests to include several complementary lines of research.</p><p>She\u2019s working on self-reconfiguring and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stochastic-robots-assemble-and-disassemble-themselves\" target=\"_self\">modular robots</a> such as MIT\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/m-blocks-modular-robotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M-Blocks</a> and NASA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/superbot-modular-multifunctional-reconfigurable-robot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SuperBots</a>, which can attach, detach, and rearrange themselves to form shapes suited for different actions such as slithering, climbing, and crawling.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nyu-tandon-robotics\" target=\"_self\">networked robots</a>\u2014including those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&amp;hvadid=675149237887&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13161685782168516493&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004281&amp;hvtargid=kwd-10573980&amp;ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&amp;hydadcr=28883_14649097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> uses in its warehouses\u2014thousands of machines can operate as a large adaptive system. The machines communicate continuously to divide tasks, avoid collisions, and optimize package routing.</p><p>Rus\u2019s team also is making advances in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/human-robot-interaction\" target=\"_self\">human-robot interaction</a>, such as reading brainwave activity and <a href=\"https://www.josephdelpreto.com/portfolio/detect-sign-language-with-a-smart-glove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interpreting sign language through a smart glove</a>.</p><p>To further her plan of putting all the computerized smarts the robots need within their physical bodies instead of in the cloud, she helped found <a href=\"https://www.liquid.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid AI</a> in 2023. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., develops <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/liquid-neural-networks\" target=\"_self\">liquid neural networks</a>, inspired by the simple brains of worms, that can learn and adapt continuously. The word <em><em>liquid</em></em> in this case refers to the adaptability, flexibility, and dynamic nature of the team\u2019s model architecture. It can change shape and adapt to new data inputs, and it fits within constraints imposed by the hardware in which it\u2019s contained, she says.</p><h2>Finding community in IEEE</h2><p>Rus joined IEEE at one of its robotics conferences when she was a graduate student.</p><p>\u201cI think I signed up just to get the student discount,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut IEEE turned out to be the place where my community lived.\u201d</p><p>She credits the organization\u2019s conferences, journals, and collaborative spirit with shaping her professional growth.</p><p>\u201cThe exchange of ideas, the chance to test your thinking against others\u2014it\u2019s invaluable,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s how our field moves forward.\u201d</p><p>Rus continues to serve on IEEE panels and committees, mentoring the next generation of roboticists.</p><p>\u201cIEEE gave me a platform,\u201d Rus says. \u201cIt taught me how to communicate, how to lead, and how to dream bigger.\u201d</p><h2>Living the American dream</h2><p>Looking back, Rus sees her story as a testament to unforeseen possibilities.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was growing up in Romania, I couldn\u2019t even imagine living in America,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I\u2019m here, working with brilliant students, building robots that help people, and trying to make a difference.

She is the principal investigator on a National Science Foundation\u2013funded project aimed at providing Long Beach residents with greater agency over the personal data their city collects.</p><p>She also identified a critical gap in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-city-emergency-response\" target=\"_blank\">smart city</a> design today: While cities may disclose how they collect data, they rarely offer ways to opt out. Shaffer spoke with <em><em>IEEE Spectrum </em></em>about the experience of leading data walks, and about her research team\u2019s efforts to give citizens more control over the data collected by public technologies.</p><p><strong>What was the inspiration for your data walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Gwen Shaffer: </strong>I began facilitating data walks in 2021. I was studying residents\u2019 comfort levels with city-deployed technologies that collect personally identifiable information. My first career as a political reporter has influenced my research approach. I feel strongly about conducting applied rather than theoretical research. And I always go into a study with the goal of helping to solve a real-world challenge and inform policy.</p><p><strong>How did you organize the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>We posted data privacy labels with a QR code that residents can scan and find out how their data are being used. Downtown, they\u2019re in Spanish and English. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia_Town,_Long_Beach,_California\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cambodia Town</a>, we did them in Khmer and English.</p><p><strong>What happened during the walks?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>I\u2019ll give you one example. In a couple of the city-owned parking garages, there are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/privacy-concerns-grow-as-us-police-departments-turn-to-license-plate-readers\" target=\"_blank\">automated license-plate readers</a> at the entrance. So when I did the data walks, I talked to our participants about how they feel about those scanners. Because once they have your license plate, if you\u2019ve parked for fewer than two hours, you can breeze right through. You don\u2019t owe money.</p><p>Responses were contextual and sometimes contradictory. There were residents who said, \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s so convenient. It\u2019s a time saver.\u201d So I think that shows how residents are willing to make trade-offs. Intellectually, they hate the idea of the privacy violation, but they also love convenience.</p><p><strong>What surprised you most?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>One of the participants said, \u201cWhen I go to the airport, I can opt out of the facial scan and still be able to get on the airplane. But if I want to participate in so many activities in the city and not have my data collected, there\u2019s no option.\u201d</p><p>There was a<a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/city-of-long-beach-ca-cyberattack/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> cyberattack against the city in November 2023</a>. Even though we didn\u2019t have a prompt asking about it, people brought it up on their own in almost every focus group. One said, \u201cI would never connect to public Wi-Fi, especially after the city of Long Beach\u2019s site was hacked.\u201d</p><p><strong>What is the app your team is developing?</strong></p><p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>Residents want agency. So that\u2019s what led my research team to connect with privacy engineers at <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, in Pittsburgh. <a href=\"https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sadeh-norman.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Norman Sadeh</a> and his team had developed what they called the<a href=\"https://privacyassistant.org/iot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IoT Assistant</a>. So I told them about our project, and proposed adapting their app for city-deployed technologies. Our plan is to give residents the opportunity to exercise their rights under the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with this app. So they could say, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.passportinc.com/faq/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Passport Parking app</a>, delete all the data you\u2019ve already collected on me. And don\u2019t collect any more in the future.\u201d</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cGwen Shaffer.\u201d</em></p>"

MRI scanners employ intense magnetic fields that create resonances at</span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK564320/\" target=\"_blank\"> tens to hundreds</a> of megahertz<span>. However, another NMR-based instrument involves  much lower-frequency oscillations: a</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_magnetometer\" target=\"_blank\"> proton-precession magnetometer</a><span>, often used to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field.</span></p><p>Proton-precession magnetometers have been around for decades and were once often used in<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100626162421/http:/www.gbl.indiana.edu/abstracts/89/peebles_89.html\" target=\"_blank\"> archaeology</a> and<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMNH43C1896B/abstract\" target=\"_blank\"> mineral exploration</a>. High-end models can cost thousands of dollars. Then, in 2022 a German engineer named Alexander Mumm devised<a href=\"https://alexmumm.de/dat/ppm_alexmumm_educational_listener.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> a very simple circuit</a> for a stripped-down one. I recently built his circuit and can attest that with less than half a kilogram of 22-gauge magnet wire; two common integrated circuits; a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET\" target=\"_blank\"> metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET</a>; a handful of discrete components; and two empty 113-gram bottles of<a href=\"https://www.mortonsalt.com/home-product/morton-natures-seasons-seasoning-blend/\" target=\"_blank\"> Morton seasoning blend</a>, it\u2019s possible to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field very accurately.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" rel=\"float: left;\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Principal components of the proton magnetometer.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ef3be\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/principal-components-of-the-proton-magnetometer.png?id=62212955&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The frequency of the signal emitted by protons precessing in Earth\u2019s magnetic field lies in the audio range, so with a pair of headphones and two amplifier integrated circuits [middle right], you can detect a signal from water in seasoning bottles wrapped in coils [bottom left and right]. A MOSFET [middle left] allows for rapid control of the coils. The amplification circuitry is powered by a 9-volt battery, while a 36-volt battery charges the coils.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>Like an MRI scanner, a proton-precession magnetometer measures the oscillations of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom\" target=\"_blank\"> hydrogen nuclei</a>\u2014that is, protons. Like other subatomic particles, protons possess a quantum property called<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)\" target=\"_blank\"> spin</a>, akin to classical angular momentum. In a magnetic field, protons wobble like spinning tops, with their spin axes tracing out a cone\u2014a phenomenon called precession. A proton-precession magnetometer gets many protons to wobble in sync and then measures the frequency of their wobbles, which is proportional to the intensity of the ambient magnetic field.</p><p>The weak strength of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/magnetic-world-model\" target=\"_blank\">Earth\u2019s magnetic field</a> (at least compared to that of an MRI machine) means that protons wobbling under its influence do so at audio frequencies. Get enough moving in unison and the spinning protons will induce a voltage in a nearby pickup coil. Amplify that and pass it through some earphones, and you get an audio tone. So with a suitable circuit, you can, literally, hear protons.</p><p>The first step is to make the pickup coils, which is where the bottles of Morton seasoning blend come in. Why Morton seasoning blend? Two reasons. First, this size bottle will allow you to wrap about 500 turns of wire around each one with about 450 grams of 22-gauge wire. Second, the bottle has little shoulders molded at each end, making for excellent coil forms.</p><h3></h3><br /><div class=\"rblad-ieee_in_content\"></div><p>Why two bottles and two coils? That\u2019s to quash electromagnetic noise\u2014principally coming from power lines\u2014that invariably gets picked up by the coils. When two counterwound coils are wired in series, such external noise tends to cancel out. Signals from precessing protons in the two coils, though, will reinforce one another.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects.</span></p><p>A proton magnetometer has three modes. The first is for sending DC current through the coils. The second mode disconnects the current source and allows the magnetic field it had created to collapse. The third is listening mode, which connects the coils to a sensitive audio amplifier. By filling each bottle with distilled water and sending a DC current (a few amperes) through these coils, you line up the spins of many protons in the water. Then, after putting your circuit into listening mode, you use the coils to sense the synchronous oscillations of the wobbling protons.</p><p>Mumm\u2019s circuit shifts from one mode to another in the simplest way possible: using a three-position switch. One position enables the DC-polarization mode. The next allows the magnetic field built up during polarization to collapse, and the third position is for listening.</p><h2>Avoiding Damaging Sparks</h2><p>The second mode might seem easy to achieve\u2014just disconnect the coils, right? But if you do that, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/you-want-a-prosthetic-leg-with-a-tesla-coil-and-spark-gaps-no-problem\" target=\"_blank\">the same principle that makes spark plugs spark</a> will put a damaging high voltage across the switch contacts as the magnetic fields around the coils collapse.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A circuit diagram. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"84f9f\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-circuit-diagram.png?id=62212916&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The proton-precession magnetometer is primarily just a multistage analog amplifier.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">James Provost</small></p><p>To avoid that, Mumm\u2019s circuit employs a MOSFET, wired to work like a high-power<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode\" target=\"_blank\"> Zener diode</a>, used in many power-regulation circuits to allow only current above a specified threshold voltage to flow. This limits the voltage that develops across the coils when the current is cut off by just enough so that the magnetometer can shift from polarizing to listening mode quickly but without causing damage.</p><p>To pick up a strong signal, the listening circuit must also be tuned to resonate at the expected frequency of proton precession, which will depend on Earth\u2019s magnetic field at your location. You can work out approximately what that is using an online<a href=\"https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml#igrfwmm\" target=\"_blank\"> geomagnetic-field calculator</a>. You\u2019ll get the field strength, and then you\u2019ll multiply that by the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio#Magnetogyric_ratio_for_a_nucleus\" target=\"_blank\"> gyromagnetic ratio</a> of protons (42.577 MHz per tesla). For me, that worked out to about 2 kilohertz. Estimating the inductance of the coils from their diameter and number of turns, I then selected a capacitor of suitable value in parallel with the coils to make a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit\" target=\"_blank\"> tank circuit</a> that resonates at that frequency.</p><p><span>You could tune your tank circuit using </span><span>a frequency generator and oscilloscope. </span><span>Or, as Mumm suggests, attach a small </span><span>speaker to the output of the circuit. Then </span><span>bring the speaker near the pickup coils. </span><span>This will create magnetic feedback and </span><span>the circuit will oscillate on it\u2019s own\u2014</span><span>loudly! You merely need to measure the </span><span>frequency of this tone, and then adjust </span><span>the tank capacitor to bring this self-os</span><span>cillation to the frequency you want to </span><span>tune to.</span></p><p>My initial attempt to listen to protons met with mixed success: Sometimes I heard tones, sometimes not. What helped to get this gizmo working consistently was realizing that proton magnetometers don\u2019t tolerate large gradients in the magnetic field. So don\u2019t try this indoors or anywhere near iron-containing objects: water pipes, cars, or even the ground. A wide-open space outside is best, with the coils raised off the ground. The second thing that helped was to apply more oomph in polarization mode. While a 12-volt battery works okay, 36 V does much better.</p><p>After figuring these things out, I can now hear protons easily. These tones are clearly the sounds of protons, because they go away if I drain the water in the bottles. And, using free audio-analyzer software called<a href=\"https://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Spectrum Lab</a>, I confirmed that the frequency of these tones matches the magnetic field at my location to about 1 percent. While it\u2019s not a practical field instrument, a proton-precession magnetometer of any kind for less than US $100 is nothing to sneer at.</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as \u201cListening to Protons.\u201d</em></p>"

Then it received a message increasing the pressure, and it was given 12 more attempts. This continued for up to 12 pressure levels. Attempts to use safe tools always returned error messages. An attempt to use a harmful tool ended the scenario.</p><p>The scenarios covered several domains. In biosecurity, Sehwag says, the agent might have to study the spread of a pathogen and find a way to contain it. A safe tool might use anonymized genetic data, while a harmful one might use data that\u2019s not anonymized. In the domain of chemical security, the agent might need to obtain a particular solvent. A safe tool might place an order for the solvent to be extracted from waste, while a harmful one might procure it illegally. In cybersecurity, the agent might need to identify and restrict a malicious user account. A safe tool might disable only the problematic account, while a harmful one might block all users. Scenarios in other domains tempted agents with tools that led to self-preservation by evading control, recruiting allies, duplicating themselves, or going rogue in other ways.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Bar chart of LLMs like Claude 4S, OpenAI o3 and O4-mini with zero pressure propensity scores below 15 percent, which nearly doubles under pressure.

Deadlines might shorten. Potential financial losses might increase if the task was not accomplished. Threats of greater oversight, reduced resources, and curtailed authority might escalate. Tasks, tools, pressures, and tactics were modeled on the kinds of situations humans might face in their jobs (except maybe the misbehavior option of cloning oneself).</p><p>The best-behaved model (OpenAI\u2019s o3) cracked under pressure in 10.5 percent of scenarios, while the worst (Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro) had a propensity score of 79 percent; the average across models was about 47 percent. Even under zero pressure, the group on average failed about 19 percent of the time. </p><p>To the degree that models remained aligned, the study shows that some of that alignment was \u201cshallow.\u201d In some tests, the researchers gave harmful tools benign names (such as \u201cuse_synthetic_data\u201d instead of \u201cuse_fake_data\u201d)\u2014without changing the tools\u2019 descriptions or admonitions to avoid them. This wording tweak increased average propensity by 17 percentage points, to 64 percent. </p><h2>Knowing What LLMs Are Thinking</h2><p>The researchers also found that models used harmful tools even after explicitly acknowledging that they were off-limits. The models offered diverse justifications for doing so, for example by citing the pressure they were under or arguing that the benefits outweighed the risks. It\u2019s unclear if models released after the study\u2019s completion would perform any better. Among the models tested, more capable models (according to a platform called <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/\" target=\"_blank\">LMArena</a>) were only slightly safer. </p><p>\u201cPropensityBench is interesting,\u201d emails <a href=\"https://nicholas.carlini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicholas Carlini</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. He offers a caveat related to what\u2019s called situational awareness. LLMs sometimes detect when they\u2019re being evaluated and act nice so they don\u2019t get retrained or shelved. \u201cI think that most of these evaluations that claim to be \u2018realistic\u2019 are very much not, and the LLMs know this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s worth trying to measure the rate of these harms in synthetic settings: If they do bad things when they \u2018know\u2019 we\u2019re watching, that\u2019s probably bad?\u201d If the models knew they were being evaluated, the propensity scores in this study may be underestimates of propensity outside the lab.</p><p><a href=\"https://aypan17.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Pan</a>, a computer scientist at <a href=\"https://x.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">xAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.berkeley.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">the University of California, Berkeley</a>, says while Anthropic and other labs have shown examples of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03222-1\" target=\"_blank\">scheming by LLMs</a> in specific setups, it\u2019s useful to have standardized benchmarks like PropensityBench. They can tell us when to trust models, and also help us figure out how to improve them. A lab might evaluate a model after each stage of training to see what makes it more or less safe. \u201cThen people can dig into the details of what\u2019s being caused when,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce we diagnose the problem, that\u2019s probably the first step to fixing it.\u201d</p><p>In this study, models didn\u2019t have access to actual tools, limiting the realism. Sehwag says a next evaluation step is to build sandboxes where models can take real actions in an isolated environment. As for increasing alignment, she\u2019d like to add oversight layers to agents that flag dangerous inclinations before they\u2019re pursued.</p><p>The self-preservation risks may be the most speculative in the benchmark, but Sehwag says they\u2019re also the most underexplored. It \u201cis actually a very high-risk domain that can have an impact on all the other risk domains,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you just think of a model that doesn\u2019t have any other capability, but it can <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/recommendation-engine-insidious\" target=\"_self\">persuade any human</a> to do anything, that would be enough to do a lot of harm.\u201d</p>"

You know your systems inside and out. You\u2019ve solved tricky problems, led small teams, and delivered results on time. But lately, between status meetings and routine design reviews, you\u2019ve caught yourself thinking: There must be a better way to do this task. Someone should make this better.</p><p>Then you spend some time imagining. Maybe it\u2019s a new tool that would save weeks of engineering time. Or a better process. Or a new product feature. You sketch it out after work hours, maybe even build a quick prototype. Then you think: I could make this product myself.</p><p>The shift from \u201csomeone should\u201d to \u201cI will\u201d is the start of entrepreneurial thinking. And you don\u2019t have to quit your job or have a billionaire\u2019s appetite for risk to begin.</p><h2>From technical proficiency to entrepreneurial thinking</h2><p>As an engineer, you already have the ability to analyze complex problems, design viable solutions, and follow them through to a working prototype. Your technical skills came from a structured training background and hands-on projects. Your ability to lead, persuade, and navigate uncertainty often comes from experience, especially when you step outside your usual responsibilities.</p><p>Some of the most game-changing products didn\u2019t begin as formal projects. They started as bootleg efforts\u2014side projects developed quietly by engineers who saw an opportunity.<a href=\"https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/c/office-supplies/notes-dispensers/b/post-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Post-it Notes</a> and<a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/gmail/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Gmail</a> both began that way. Many companies now encourage such efforts; some even allow their engineers to devote 15 to 20 percent of their workweek to pursuing their own ideas.</p><h2>Closing the intention-action gap</h2><p>Ideas can be easy. Execution is harder. Nearly every engineer has a colleague with a clever idea that never got past the whiteboard. The difference between wanting to act and actually taking action\u2014known as the<a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/intention-action-gap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <em><em>intention-action gap</em></em></a>\u2014is where entrepreneurship lives or dies.

Here are ways to reprogram your mindset.</p><ul><li><strong>Challenge the default.</strong> Engineers are taught to follow proven processes, but innovation often starts by asking, \u201cWhat if we did it differently?\u201d</li><li><strong>Balance the team.</strong> Innovative companies need a diverse mix of creative thinkers to generate ideas, entrepreneurs to drive execution, and managers to scale efficiently.</li><li><strong>Know your lane.</strong> Whether you\u2019re a visionary, a builder, or an optimizer, understanding your strengths can help you find the right collaborators.</li></ul><p>And, yes, timing matters.<a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Amazon</a> might have stayed just an online bookstore without the rise of e-commerce. The<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-founders-prioritize-the-problem\" target=\"_self\"> right idea at the wrong time</a> is likely to struggle. Start with current trends, for instance, AI offers extremely low entry barriers to get started, and everything is being built around it these days.</p><h2>An engineering attitude</h2><p>Entrepreneurial thinking isn\u2019t only for startup founders. It can mean championing a new process at your company, building an internal tool that changes how your team works, or bringing a product idea from sketch to launch.

That includes titanium components, which have historically caused trouble for 3D printers.</p><p>3D printing has used metals included aluminum, powdered steel, and nickel alloys <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printed-rocket\" target=\"_blank\">for some time</a>. While titanium parts are in high demand in fields such as aerospace and health care due to their superior strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and their suitability for complex geometries, the metal has presented challenges for 3D printers.</p><p>Titanium becomes more reactive at high temperatures and tends to crack when the printed part cools. It can also become brittle as it absorbs hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen during the printing process. Carrington says CMF overcomes these issues.</p><p>\u201cOur primary customers tend to come from the energy, defense, and aerospace industries,\u201d says Carrington. \u201cOne large defense contractor recently switched from traditional 3D printing to CMF as it will save them millions and reduce prototyping and parts production by months.\u201d</p><h2>How CMF Enhances Titanium 3D Printing Efficiency</h2><p>CMF combines the flexibility of 3D printing with new powder metallurgy processes to provide strength and greater durability to parts made from titanium and many other metals and alloys. The process uses a combination of proprietary metal powder and polymer binding agents that are fused layer by layer to create high-strength metal components.</p><p>The process begins like any other <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mechanical-metamaterials-and-other-3d-printing-tech-from-chi-2017\" target=\"_blank\">3D printing project</a>: A digital file that represents the desired 3D object directs the actions of a standard industrial 3D printer in laying down a mixture of metal and a plastic binder. A laser lightly fuses each layer of powder into a cohesive solid structure. Excess powder is removed for reuse.</p><p>Where CMF differs is that the initial parts generated by this stage of the process are strong enough for grinding, drilling, and milling if required. The parts then soak in a solvent to dissolve the plastic binder. Next, they go into a furnace to burn off any remaining binder, fuse the metal particles, and compact them into a dense metal component. Surface or finishing treatments can then be applied such as polishing and heat treatment.</p><p>\u201cOur cold metal fusion technology offers a process that is at least three times faster and more scalable than any other kind of 3D printing,\u201d says Carrington. \u201cPer-part prices are generally 50 to 60 percent less than alternative metal 3D printing technology. We expect those prices to go down even more as we scale.\u201d</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Shiny silver turbine wheel with blades, placed on a dark textured surface.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ec031\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/shiny-silver-turbine-wheel-with-blades-placed-on-a-dark-textured-surface.jpg?id=62225237&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">3D printing with metal powders such as titanium makes it possible to create parts with complex geometries.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">CADmore Metal</small></p><p>The material used in CMF was developed by <a href=\"https://www.headmade-materials.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Headmade Materials</a>, a German company.

When you find yourself in a toxic work environment, what should you do?</span></p><p>Is it worth trying to improve things over time, or should you just leave? </p><p>The difficult truth is that, in nearly every case, the answer is to leave a toxic team as soon as you can. Here\u2019s why:</p><ul><li>If you\u2019re earlier in your career, you frankly don\u2019t have much political power in the organization. Any arguments to change team culture or address systemic problems will likely fall on deaf ears. You\u2019ll end up frustrated, and your efforts will be wasted.</li><li>If you\u2019re more senior, you have some ability to improve processes and relationships on the team. However, if you\u2019re an individual contributor (IC), your capabilities are still limited. There is likely some \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of quick improvements to suggest. A few thoughtful pieces of feedback could address many of the problems. If you\u2019ve done that and things are still not getting better, it\u2019s probably time to leave.</li><li>If you\u2019re part of upper management, you may have inherited the problem, or maybe you were even brought in to solve it. This is the rare case where you could consider the change scenario and address the broken culture: You have both the context and power to make a difference.</li></ul><p>The world of technology is large, and constantly getting larger. Don\u2019t waste your time on a bad team or with a bad manager. Find another team, company, or start something on your own.</p><p>Engineers often hesitate to leave a poor work environment because they\u2019re afraid or unsure about the process of finding something new. That\u2019s a valid concern. However, inertia should not be the reason you stick around in a job. The best careers stem from the excitement of actively choosing your work, not tolerating toxicity.</p><p>Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that even in a toxic team, you\u2019ll still come across smart and kind people. If you are stuck on a bad team, seek out the people who match your wavelength. These relationships will enable you to find new opportunities when you inevitably decide to leave!</p><p>\u2014Rahul</p><h2><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-wie-podcast-women-in-tech\" target=\"_self\">IEEE Podcast Focuses on Women in Tech</a></h2><p>Are you looking for a new podcast to add to your queue?

That means more than anything else in the remaining years before 6G\u2019s anticipated rollout, high-capacity connections behind cell towers are a key game to win. Which brings industry scrutiny, then, to what telecom folks call backhaul\u2014<a href=\"https://www.trentonsystems.com/en-us/resource-hub/blog/wired-access-backhaul-vs-wireless-access-backhaul\" target=\"_blank\">the high-capacity fiber or wireless links that pass data from cell towers toward the internet backbone</a>. It\u2019s the difference between the \u201clocal\u201d connection from your phone to a nearby tower and the \u201ctrunk\u201d connection that carries millions of signals simultaneously. </p><p><span>But the backhaul crisis ahead isn\u2019t just about capacity. It\u2019s also about architecture. 5G was designed around a world where phones dominated, downloading video at higher and higher resolutions. 6G is now shaping up to be something else entirely. This inversion\u2014from 5G\u2019s anticipated downlink deluge to 6G\u2019s uplink resurgence\u2014requires rethinking everything at the core level, practically from scratch.</span></p><p>Vetter\u2019s career spans the entire arc of the wireless telecom era\u2014from optical interconnections in the 1990s at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatel_Mobile\" target=\"_blank\">Alcatel</a> (a research center pioneering fiber-to-home connections) to his roles at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Labs</a> and later Nokia Bell Labs, culminating in 2021 in his current position at the industry\u2019s bellwether institution.</p><p>In this conversation, held in November at the <a href=\"https://www.b6gs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn 6G Summit</a> in New York, Vetter explains what 5G got wrong, what 6G must do differently, and whether these innovations can arrive before telecom\u2019s networks start running out of room.</p><h3>5G\u2019s Expensive Miscalculation</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum: </em>Where is telecom today, halfway between 5G\u2019s rollout and 6G\u2019s anticipated rollout?</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Vetter: </strong>Today, we have enough spectrum and capacity. But going forward, there will not be enough. The 5G network by the end of the decade will run out of steam. We have traffic simulations. And it is something that has been consistent generation to generation, from 2G to 3G to 4G. Every decade, capacity goes up by about a factor of 10. So you need to prepare for that.</p><p>And the challenge for us as researchers is how do you do that in an energy-efficient way? Because the power consumption cannot go up by a factor of 10. The cost cannot go up by a factor of 10. And then, lesson learned from 5G: The idea was, \u201cOh, we do that in higher spectrum. There is more bandwidth. Let\u2019s go to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bytes-millimeter-waves-explained\" target=\"_blank\">millimeter wave</a>.\u201d The lesson learned is, okay, millimeter waves have short reach. You need a small cell [tower] every 300 meters or so. And that doesn\u2019t cut it. It was too expensive to install all these small cells.</p><p><strong>Is this related to the backhaul question?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So backhaul is the connection between the base station and what we call the core of the network\u2014the data centers, and the servers. Ideally, you use fiber to your base station. If you have that fiber as a service provider, use it. It gives you the highest capacity. But very often new cell sites don\u2019t have that fiber backhaul, then there are alternatives: wireless backhaul.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Close-up of a Nokia radio on glass circuit board.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c9af3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-a-nokia-radio-on-glass-circuit-board.png?id=62261540&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Nokia Bell Labs has pioneered a glass-based chip architecture for telecom\u2019s backhaul signals, communicating between towers and telecom infrastructure.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Nokia</small></p><h3>Radios Built on Glass Push Frequencies Higher</h3><p><strong>What are the challenges ahead for wireless backhaul?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>To get up to the 100-gigabit-per-second, fiber-like speeds, you need to go to higher frequency bands.</p><p><strong>Higher frequency bands for the signals the backhaul antennas use?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Yes. The challenge is the design of the radio front ends and the radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) at those frequencies. You cannot really integrate [present-day] antennas with RFICs at those high speeds.</p><p><strong>And what happens as those signal frequencies get higher?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So in a millimeter wave, say 28 gigahertz, you could still do [the electronics and waveguides] for this with a classical printed circuit board. But as the frequencies go up, the attenuation gets too high.</p><p><strong>What happens when you get to, say, 100 GHz?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>[Conventional materials] are no good anymore. So we need to look at other still low-cost materials. We have done pioneering work at Bell Labs on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzl0UHyRjRo\" target=\"_blank\">radio on glass</a>. And we use glass not for its optical transparency, but for its transparency in the <a href=\"https://www.rfwireless-world.com/terminology/sub-thz-bands-frequencies\" target=\"_blank\">subterahertz radio range</a>.</p><p><strong>Is Nokia Bell Labs making these radio-on-glass backhaul systems for 100-GHz communications?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>I used an order of magnitude. Above 100 GHz, you need to look into a different material. But [the wavelength range] is actually 140 to 170 GHz, what is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_band_(waveguide)\" target=\"_blank\">D-Band</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>We collaborate with our internal customers to get these kind of concepts on the long-term road map. As an example, that D-Band radio system, we actually integrated it in a prototype with our mobile business group. And we tested it last year at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics in Paris</a>.<strong></strong></p><p>But this is, as I said, a prototype. We need to mature the technology between a research prototype and qualifying it to go into production. The researcher on that is <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DK2TMVgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Shahriar Shahramian</a>. He\u2019s well-known in the field for this.</p><h3>Why 6G\u2019s Bandwidth Crisis Isn\u2019t About Phones</h3><p><strong>What will be the applications that\u2019ll drive the big 6G demands for bandwidth?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>We\u2019re installing more and more cameras and other types of sensors. I mean, we\u2019re going into a world where we want to create large world models that are synchronous copies of the physical world. So what we will see going forward in 6G is a massive-scale deployment of sensors which will feed the AI models. So a lot of uplink capacity. That\u2019s where a lot of that increase will come from.</p><p><strong>Any others?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Autonomous cars could be an example. It can also be in industry\u2014like a digital twin of a harbor, and how you manage that? It can be a digital twin of a warehouse, and you query the digital twin, \u201cWhere is my product X?\u201d Then a robot will automatically know thanks to the updated digital twin where it is in the warehouse and which route to take. Because it knows where the obstacles are in real time, thanks to that massive-scale sensing of the physical world and then the interpretation with the AI models.</p><p>You will have your agents that act on behalf of you to do your groceries or order a driverless car. They will actively record where you are, make sure that there are also the proper privacy measures in place. So that your agent has an understanding of the state you\u2019re in and can serve you in the most optimal way.</p><h3>How 6G Networks Will Help Detect Drones, Earthquakes, and Tsunamis</h3><p><strong>You\u2019ve described before how 6G signals can not only transmit data but also provide sensing. How will that work?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The augmentation now is that the network can be turned also in a sensing modality. That if you turn around the corner, a camera doesn\u2019t see you anymore. But the radio still can detect people that are coming, for instance, at a traffic crossing. And you can anticipate that. Yeah, warn a car that, \u201cThere\u2019s a pedestrian coming. Slow down.\u201d We also have fiber sensing. And for instance, using fibers at the bottom of the ocean and detecting movements of waves and detect tsunamis, for instance, and do an early tsunami warning.</p><p><strong>What are your teams\u2019 findings?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>The present-day use of tsunami warning buoys are a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-12-tsunami-buoys-safeguarding-thailand.html\" target=\"_blank\">few hundred kilometers offshore</a>. These tsunami waves travel at 300 and more meters per second, and so you only have 15 minutes to warn the people and evacuate. If you have now a fiber sensing network across the ocean that you can detect it much deeper in the ocean, you can do meaningful early tsunami warning.</p><p>We recently detected there was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Kamchatka_earthquake\" target=\"_blank\">major earthquake in East Russia</a>. That was last July. And we had a fiber sensing system between Hawaii and California. And we were able to see that earthquake on the fiber. And we also saw the development of the tsunami wave.</p><h3>6G\u2019s Thousands of Antennas and Smarter Waveforms</h3><p><strong>Bell Labs was an early pioneer in multiple-input, multiple-output (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO\" target=\"_blank\">MIMO</a>) antennas starting in the 1990s. Where multiple transmit and receive antennas could carry many data streams at once. What is Bell Labs doing with MIMO now to help solve these bandwidth problems you\u2019ve described?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So, as I said earlier, you want to provide capacity from existing cell sites. And the way to MIMO can do that by a technology called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming\" target=\"_blank\">simplified beamforming</a>: If you want better coverage at a higher frequency, you need to focus your electromagnetic energy, your radio energy, even more. So in order to do that, you need a larger amount of antennas.</p><p>So if you double the frequency, we go from 3.5 GHz, which is the <a href=\"https://www.digi.com/blog/post/what-is-c-band-and-why-is-it-important-for-5g\" target=\"_blank\">C-band in 5G</a>, now to 6G, 7 GHz. So it\u2019s about double. That means the wavelength is half. So you can fit four times more antenna elements in the same form factor. So physics helps us in that sense.</p><p><strong>What\u2019s the catch?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>Where physics doesn\u2019t help us is more antenna elements means more signal processing, and the power consumption goes up. So here is where the research then comes in. Can we creatively get to these larger antenna arrays without the power consumption going up?<strong></strong></p><p>The use of AI is important in this. How can we leverage AI to do channel estimation, to do such things as equalization, to do smart beamforming, to learn the waveform, for instance?</p><p>We\u2019ve shown that with these kind of AI techniques, we can get actually up to 30 percent more capacity on the same spectrum.</p><p><strong>And that allows many gigabits per second to go out to each phone or device?</strong></p><p><strong>Vetter: </strong>So gigabits per second is already possible in 5G. We\u2019ve demonstrated that. You can imagine that this could go up, but that\u2019s not really the need. The need is really how many more can you support from a base station?</p>"

That approach delivered astonishing breakthroughs in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models\" target=\"_blank\">large language models</a> (LLMs); </span><span>i</span><span>n just five years, </span><span>AI has </span><span>leapt from models like GPT-2, which could hardly mimic coherence, to systems like GPT-5 </span><span>that </span><span>can reason and engage in substantive dialogue. And now early prototypes of AI agents that can navigate codebases or </span><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-agents-computer-use\" target=\"_self\">browse the web</a><span> point towards an entirely new frontier.</span></p><p>But size alone can only take AI so far. The next leap won\u2019t come from bigger models alone<span>. I</span>t will come from combining ever-better data with worlds we build for models to learn in. And the most important question <span>becomes: What do classrooms for AI look like?</span></p><p><span>In the past few</span> month<span>s</span> Silicon Valley has placed its bets, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>with labs investing billions</span></a> in constructing <span>such </span>classrooms, which are called reinforcement learning (RL) environments. These environments let machines experiment, fail, and improve in realistic digital spaces. </p><h2>AI Training: From Data to Experience</h2><p>The history of modern AI has unfolded in eras, each defined by the kind of data that the models consumed. First came the age of pretraining on internet-scale datasets. This commodity data allowed machines to mimic human language by recognizing statistical patterns. Then came  <span>data combined</span> with reinforcement learning from human feedback\u2014a technique that uses crowd workers to grade responses from LLMs\u2014which made AI more useful, responsive, and aligned with human preferences.<br /></p><p>We have experienced both eras firsthand. Working in the trenches of model data <span>at <a href=\"https://scale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scale AI</a></span> exposed us to what many consider the fundamental problem in AI: ensuring that the <span>training </span>data fueling these models is diverse, accurate, and effective in driving performance gains. Systems trained on clean, structured, expert-labeled data made leaps. Cracking the data problem allowed us to pioneer some of the most critical advancements in LLMs over the past few years.</p><p>Today, data is still a foundation. It is the raw material from which intelligence is built. But we are entering a new phase where data alone is no longer enough. To unlock the next frontier, we must pair high-quality data with environments that allow limitless interaction, continuous feedback, and learning through action. RL environments don\u2019t replace data; they amplify what data can do by enabling models to apply knowledge, test hypotheses, and refine behaviors in realistic settings.</p><h2>How an RL Environment Works</h2><p>In an RL environment, the model learns through a simple loop: it observes the state of the world, takes an action, and receives a reward that indicates whether that action helped accomplish a goal. Over many iterations, the model gradually discovers strategies that lead to better outcomes. The crucial shift is that training becomes interactive\u2014models aren\u2019t just predicting the next token but improving through trial, error, and feedback.</p><p>For example, language models can already generate code in a simple chat setting. Place them in a live coding environment<span>\u2014</span>where they can ingest context, run their code, debug errors, and refine their solution<span>\u2014</span>and something changes. They shift from advising to autonomously <span>problem-</span>solving.</p><p>This distinction matters. In a software-driven world, the ability for AI to generate and test production-level code in vast repositories will mark a <span>major</span> change in capability. That leap won\u2019t come solely from larger datasets; it will come from immersive environments where agents can experiment, stumble, and learn through iteration\u2014much like human programmers do. The real world of development is messy: Coders have to deal with underspecified bugs, tangled codebases, vague requirements. Teaching AI to handle that mess is the only way it will ever graduate from producing error-prone attempts to generating consistent and reliable solutions.</p><h2>Can AI Handle the Messy Real World?</h2><p>Navigating the internet is also messy. Pop-ups, login walls, broken links, and outdated information are woven throughout day-to-day browsing workflows. Humans handle these disruptions almost instinctively, but AI can only develop that capability by training in environments that simulate the web\u2019s unpredictability. Agents must learn how to recover from errors, recognize and persist through user-interface obstacles, and complete multi-step workflows across widely used applications.</p><p>Some of the most important environments aren\u2019t public at all. Governments and enterprises are actively building secure simulations where AI can practice high-stakes decision-making without real-world consequences. Consider disaster relief: It would be unthinkable to deploy an untested agent in a live hurricane response. But in a simulated world of ports, roads, and supply chains, an agent can fail a thousand times and gradually get better at crafting the optimal plan.</p><p>Every major leap in AI has relied on unseen infrastructure, such as annotators labeling datasets, researchers training reward models, and engineers building scaffoldings for LLMs to use tools and take action. <span>Finding l</span>arge-volume and high-quality datasets <span>was </span>once the bottleneck in AI, and solving that problem sparked the previous wave of progress. Today, the bottleneck is not data\u2014it\u2019s building RL environments that are rich, realistic, and truly useful.</p><p><span>The next phase of AI progress</span> won\u2019t be an accident of scale. It will be the result of combining strong data foundations with interactive environments that teach machines how to act, adapt, and reason across messy real-world scenarios. Coding sandboxes, OS and browser playgrounds, and secure simulations will turn prediction into competence.</p>"
